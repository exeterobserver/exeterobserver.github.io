Freedom of information requests have revealed a “chumocracy” redolent of the current Conservative government’s approach to appointments and procurement despite Exeter City Council’s claim to be “committed to openness and transparency”.</p><p>Read <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/09/16/freedom-of-information-requests-reveal-liveable-exeter-place-board-chumocracy-overseeing-the-city/">more on our website</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/exeterobserver/status/1438477870448496640">join the conversation on Twitter</a>.</p><p><strong>OUTSOURCED EXETER LOCAL GOVERNMENT</strong></p><p>The second examines the board’s role, reach and potential impact. We have gathered evidence which shows that, notwithstanding Exeter City Council’s claims to the contrary, the board is a de facto decision-making and governance body which exercises public functions with the potential to affect everyone who lives and works in Exeter.</p><p>Read <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/09/22/city-council-outsourcing-exeter-local-government-to-unaccountable-liveable-exeter-place-board/">the full story</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/exeterobserver/status/1440644451207049228">join the conversation on Twitter</a>.</p><h2 id="in-case-you-missed-it">IN CASE YOU MISSED IT</h2><p><strong>HARLEQUINS DEVELOPER PLANS SECOND “CO-LIVING” BLOCK INSTEAD OF HOTEL</strong></p><p>Exeter City Council approved plans to redevelop Harlequins shopping centre last year despite vehement opposition from residents, campaigners and conservation charities.</p><p>Since receiving formal consent for the scheme the developer has submitted a revised application to return to an earlier, rejected, vision for the site which will replace the planned hotel with a second “co-living” block.</p><p>A revised economic impact assessment now discounts the scheme’s claimed benefits and <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/07/22/harlequins-developer-plans-to-scrap-hotel-to-build-second-co-living-block-on-shopping-centre-site/">observers remain convinced the co-living blocks are student accommodation in all but name</a>.</p><p><strong>COMMUNITY ARTS CENTRE DESPITE CITYPOINT REDEVELOPMENT THREAT</strong></p><p>Parts of Exeter city centre are experiencing an unplanned renaissance as small shops and cultural venues fill empty units on Paris Street and Sidwell Street, but the council still intends to demolish and redevelop the area, with outline plans framed around massive build to rent blocks, hotels, offices and a brand new civic centre for itself.</p><p>Positive Light Projects has nevertheless transformed a disused building on Sidwell Street into <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/07/21/positive-light-projects-opens-community-arts-centre-despite-exeter-city-council-citypoint-site-redevelopment-threat/">artist studios, gallery space, a photography studio, offices and meeting space for local groups</a>.</p><h2 id="other-news">OTHER NEWS</h2><p><strong>SOUND FAMILIAR?</strong></p><p>A <a href="https://www.cfgs.org.uk/">Centre for Governance and Scrutiny</a> report into Nottingham City Council’s “superficial and inadequate” scrutiny mechanisms has been published following a public interest report by auditor Grant Thornton which accused the council of “institutional blindness” over poor financial decision-making which led to it borrowing £35 million from the government to avoid collapse.</p><p>The <a href="https://committee.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/documents/g9136/Public%20reports%20pack%2008th-Sep-2021%2014.00%20Overview%20and%20Scrutiny%20Committee.pdf?T=10">CfGS report</a> (item five) places some of the blame on a political culture where any public challenge is seen as “disloyalty”.</p><p><strong>IT’S GRIM DOWN SOUTH WEST …</strong></p><p>Recent <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s36778/Devon%20Economy%20Briefing%20data%20analysis%20August%202021.pdf">synthesis of economic data</a> by Devon County Council makes for gloomy reading. Before the pandemic began 39% of children across the county were part of working families claiming tax credits (3% higher than the national average) with even more in some areas (43% in North Devon and 44% in Torridge), while average pay for the lowest 20% of earners fell between 2019 and 2020, a period during which it rose nationally.</p><p>Exeter fared worst among Devon districts, with a 14% fall, at the same time as house prices rose by 18% and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/indexofprivatehousingrentalprices/august2021#uk-private-rental-growth-by-english-region">rents increased by more than twice as much as in the rest of the country</a>.</p><p>As the pandemic has eased, the county has continued to struggle, with high housing costs, low wages and the “staycation” boom prompting landlords to cash in on short term lets among factors causing significant local labour shortages. Meanwhile high street vacancy rates remain above the national average in many areas, including Exeter city centre.</p><p><strong>… BUT WE’RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER</strong></p><p>Last Friday the <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/full-ndc-synthesis-report-some-progress-but-still-a-big-concern">UN released a report</a> assessing the combined climate action plans of all 191 parties to the Paris Agreement which found that they point towards a catastrophic 2.7°C temperature rise by the end of the century.</p><p>Not only that. Instead of a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2010 levels by 2030, necessary to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C according to the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/">IPCC sixth assessment report published last month</a>, current Paris Agreement signatory plans put us on course for a 16% increase by that date.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in post-Brexit blighty, an <a href="https://wearealbert.org/editorial/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/albert-subtitle-report-2021.pdf">analysis of how UK broadcasters are exposing audiences to climate change</a> found that the word “cake” was used ten times more often than the phrase “climate change” on UK TV in 2020.</p><p><strong>NO JOKE</strong></p><p>Our thanks to a reader of <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/07/30/the-exeter-digest-5-harlequins-developer-plans-second-co-living-block-community-arts-centre-opens-despite-citypoint-threat-city-of-culture-bid-parliamentary-boundary-review/">Exeter Digest #5</a>, who pointed out that use of the toilets included in Exeter’s new, apparently “state of the art” bus station, is not free of charge. He told us he found that users have to spend more than a penny whichever way they pay.</p><h2 id="on-the-agenda">ON THE AGENDA</h2><p><strong>NEW EXETER LOCAL PLAN</strong></p><p>Exeter City Council began the process of lining up its spatial development aspiration ducks this week by opening the first of several consultations on the new Exeter Local Plan. We are asked to consider and comment on an <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/localplan/">Issues consultation document</a> ( <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5749/nelp.pdf">here</a> with officer report <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s79838/Report%20-%20Exeter%20Local%20Plan%20Issues%20consultation%20document%20-%20FINAL.pdf">here</a>) and a new <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/planning-policy/new-exeter-statement-of-community-involvement-draft-consultation/">Statement of Community Involvement</a> (document <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5751/sci.pdf">here</a> and officer report <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s79840/Report%20-%20New%20Statement%20of%20Community%20Involvement%20-%20FINAL.pdf">here</a>).</p><p>The first outlines the key issues the new local plan is intended to address, and is presented alongside the “Exeter 2040 Vision” and “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme. The second outlines the ways in which the public, organisations and “other interested parties” are involved in city planning processes.</p><p>Both will be amended following the consultation and brought back for approval by council members before being used as a basis on which a formal draft Exeter Local Plan will be produced next year.</p><p>The current consultation runs until 15 November, and includes two public exhibitions: Thursday 30 September at Exeter Central Library and Wednesday 13 October at the Guildhall, both 1-7pm. Hard copies of the consultation documents can also be viewed during opening hours at the Civic Centre on Paris Street and at Exeter Central Library.</p><p>The new Local Development Scheme, which sets out the local plan preparation timetable is <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5635/210601_lds-approved-by-executive-june-2021.pdf">here</a>.</p><p><strong>HEAVITREE &amp; WHIPTON LOW TRAFFIC NEIGHBOURHOOD</strong></p><p>The second phase of public consultation on Devon County Council’s plans to reduce traffic volumes in Heavitree and Whipton (although not, of course, on the arterial routes which run through them). The first phase, which informed <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/haveyoursay/consultations/heavitree-and-whipton-exeter-local-streets-2/">the options on offer in phase two</a>, took place at the end of last year: a response summary is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JmFIMW5IWnjKrUtyT6Ls1kkHx5bdWq4V/view">here</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://placebuilder.io/exeterstreets/heavitreeandwhipton/">current survey can be completed online</a> until 7 October. “Measures which receive the most public support are expected to form part of a trial later this year.”</p><p><strong>QUEEN STREET &amp; IRON BRIDGE ROAD LAYOUT CHANGES</strong></p><p>Another county highways consultation, this one on making permanent the <a href="https://devoncc.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/PublicDocs/Corporate/EYFF2K3Xkt9EpXVlKi0SwG4BE4BR33wfXwr4WsU3h3KocQ?e=ar7slN">temporary traffic restriction changes on Queen Street and Iron Bridge</a> that were introduced earlier this year. Respondents are asked to comment on <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/haveyoursay/consultations/queen-street-and-iron-bridge-exeter/">three options</a> as well as make additional suggestions.</p><p>The <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=gzehjWjLP0S7S5l_d_1b-wmD9DPGgUBOjmI7Qmh6osZUNFE0NlRLUDhIQTRYT1JFTk8xSVBVOTI0Si4u">online survey</a> closes on 13 October. “If a permanent change were supported, Traffic Regulation Orders would then need to be advertised and consulted on, with a final decision on progressing any permanent change to be made by elected councillors at a future committee meeting.”</p><h2 id="labour-unlimited">LABOUR UNLIMITED</h2><p>Thanks also to another reader, who sent us a local Labour party leaflet which was delivered through their door complete with some rather surprising claims. One in particular stood out. Under the heading: “Across Exeter your Labour councillors have achieved” it said: “Reaching net zero carbon by 2030”.</p><p>Unless a casual slice of grammar butchery, or an act of radical historical revisionism, it must surely mark a new peak in <a href="https://www.exeter-labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/200/2021/03/Exeter-City-Manifesto-2021.pdf">heroic Exeter Labour confidence</a>, presenting the city’s future as a fait accompli.

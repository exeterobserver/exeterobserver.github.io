Shell and BP, in which Devon’s public sector pension fund has invested nearly £57 million of scheme members’ money, recently held AGMs which <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/26/devon-pension-fund-fossil-fuel-investment-position-exposed-by-shell-andbp-agm-votes/">illustrate the point</a>.</p><p><strong>DISTRICT HEATING NETWORK GOES UP IN SMOKE:</strong> A plan to supply the South West Exeter development of 2500 homes with heat from the Marsh Barton waste incinerator has been abandoned because most of the property developers involved in the scheme are unwilling to accept modest additional up front costs. Local authorities had promised £7.3 million to the project, which relied on the city’s <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/24/south-west-exeter-district-heating-network-plan-abandoned-because-property-developers-refuse-to-back-scheme/">largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p><p><strong>INFORMATION WANTS TO BE FREE:</strong> This time last month Open Democracy won <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jun/08/uk-government-loses-legal-battle-transparency-orwellian-unit">its three year legal battle</a> with the Cabinet Office over its secretive “Clearing House”, which has been accused of obstructing the release of material under the Freedom of Information Act and <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/freedom-of-information/foi-clearing-house-michael-gove-cabinet-office-opendemocracy-wins-court-case-uk-government/">“blacklisting” journalists and campaigners</a>.</p><p>Judge Chris Hughes found that there was a “profound lack of transparency about the operation” and criticised the Cabinet Office for a “lacuna in public information” around the way the Clearing House co-ordinates Freedom of Information request responses. The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs select committee has now <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/call-for-evidence/532/the-cabinet-office-freedom-of-information-clearing-house/">launched an inquiry</a> into how the Clearing House handles requests and whether its measures comply with the Freedom of Information Act.</p><h2 id="other-news">OTHER NEWS</h2><p><strong>LONGBROOK STREET PBSA GIFTED SECOND LIFE:</strong> Exeter City Council planning officers <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s79515/Delegated%20Decisions%2012%20May%20-%2017%20June.pdf">approved the renewal</a> of planning permission for an eight storey 108-bed student accommodation block on the site of the King Billy public house which had <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/01/21/longbrook-street-student-accommodation-development-reapplication-king-billy-demolition/">previously been granted in April 2018 and since lapsed</a>.</p><p>The plans include provision for street level retail despite the developers of the monolithic student block on Cheeke Street known as “The Depot” seeking to convert several of its ground floor retail units to student bedrooms because <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/03/26/developer-plans-to-convert-retail-units-in-exeter-city-centre-block-to-additional-student-bedrooms/">commercial tenants cannot be found for the shops</a>.

The government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uks-prototype-fusion-energy-plant-is-one-step-closer-to-finding-a-home">long list of fifteen sites</a> is now being whittled down in Whitehall. Don’t all rush at once: the project’s initial aim is not to produce a concept design until 2024.</p><h2 id="partnership-agreement-of-the-week">PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE WEEK</h2><p>In a hotly-contested field, this week’s winner must surely be the new <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s79825/Exeter%20Civic%20Partnership%20Agreement.pdf">Exeter Civic University Agreement</a>, which found its way onto last night’s city council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6943&amp;Ver=4">Executive agenda</a>. Laced with the language of estate agency, this document envisages a utopian future for the city with the rest of the UK following behind. Here’s the rousing peroration:</p><p>“The university and its anchor city partners, as signatories of this Civic University Agreement, are committed to working together to help overcome the major social, economic and environmental challenges that we all face, together for Exeter. We are bound by the partnership framework set out in this document to seek to improve levels of prosperity, equal opportunity, sustainability, health and wellbeing for Exeter’s citizens, families and communities.”</p><p>Helpfully the doc includes photos of the four signatories so you’ll know who to look out for at the next garden party.</p><h2 id="on-the-agenda">ON THE AGENDA</h2><p><strong>UP THE JUNCTION:</strong> Devon County Council’s consultation on proposals for the Union Road section of the E4 cycle route, including Stoke Hill roundabout, closes next Tuesday 13 July. This section of the route, which will eventually connect Exeter Science Park with St David’s station, has put cyclists in danger for many years.

This is the process which was used to transfer ownership of the city’s valley parks to Devon Wildlife Trust. The draft policy is <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5623/accesible-community-asset-transfer-policy-draft-may21.pdf">here</a> and the online consultation is <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/cat/">here</a>.</p><p><strong>WHO SAYS PUBLIC SERVICE DOESN’T PAY?</strong> Exeter City Council’s Executive <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=6546&amp;EVT=101&amp;DT=M">has recommended</a> that Rachel Lyons be granted the position of Honorary Alderman of the City, alongside Olwen Foggin and Lesley Robson, when the council meets on 21 July.</p><h2 id="caption-competition">CAPTION COMPETITION</h2><p>Exeter City Council <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/exeter-awarded-432-000-from-the-home-office-to-tackle-crime/">celebrated</a> its high crime rate [Surely “Home Office Safer Streets Fund award”?

In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/local-government-association-annual-conference-2021-secretary-of-states-speech">speech to the Local Government Association</a> earlier this week, communities secretary Robert Jenrick indicated that he was no longer intending the pursue the radical changes promised in <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/958420/MHCLG-Planning-Consultation.pdf">last year’s white paper</a>.</p><p>He said he wanted to see “sensible and pragmatic reforms” but did not think the government needed “to rip up the planning system and start again”. The Housing, Communities and Local Government <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6180/documents/68915/default/">select committee report</a> considering the plans offers useful analysis for those who want to know more. The government is expected to publish its proposals next month.</p><p><strong>HOW GREEN IS MY INDUSTRIAL VALLEY?</strong> Centre-right think tank Onward published a <a href="https://www.ukonward.com/qualifyingfornetzero/">report assessing the labour market challenges</a> entailed by the UK’s decarbonisation plans this week. It says 3.2 million people will need to retrain or increase their skill levels, with the construction sector affected most of all. It also examines regional exposure to the required changes: the South West is less vulnerable than many areas because of its relatively low levels of carbon-intensive industries. But this means that there are fewer economic opportunities in carbon mitigation activity here too.</p><p>One striking finding from <a href="https://www.ukonward.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Qualifying-for-the-race-to-net-zero-FINAL.pdf">the report</a> is that while 1.1 million workers will be required to retrofit homes and decarbonise domestic heating by 2030, only 5,700 are currently being trained to do these jobs each year.</p><p><strong>PINF PINCH:</strong> The Public Interest News Foundation yesterday published the <a href="https://990e0d26-37fa-4980-84b1-f421096cd490.filesusr.com/ugd/e041f9_ec4acb71526b4507a75b2b7a287a94c6.pdf">first survey</a> of the UK’s independent news publishing sector. Research carried out by Clare Cook and Dr Coral Milburn-Curtis of the <a href="https://mediainnovationstudio.org/">Media Innovation Studio</a> at the University of Central Lancashire found that the reach of the sector far outstrips its revenue: the 56 survey respondents reached 10 million monthly unique users last year but their combined revenues were less than £5.4 million.</p><p>In contrast Reach, the UK’s largest commercial publisher and the company which dominates Devon’s news media, reached an average of 42.1 million users per month in 2020 with <a href="https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/reach-and-revenue-56-independent-publishers-reach-10m-earn-just-5-4m/">revenue of just over £600 million</a>.</p><p><strong>REUTERS REPORT:</strong> The tenth annual edition of the University of Oxford’s <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/">journalism research institute</a> global news survey offers its familiar <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021">deep dive into the sector</a>. Outputs include:</p><ul><li>The trust gap between the news in general and that found in aggregated environments has grown, with audiences seemingly placing a greater premium on accurate and reliable news sources.</li><li>Facebook is seen as the main channel for spreading false information almost everywhere.</li><li>In the UK, despite audiences relying on search engines and social media for information on jobs, “things to do”, weather forecasts and even COVID-19, they still think of newspapers as the best destination for local politics.</li><li>In the UK both left and right feel that their political views are unfairly covered by the media.</li></ul><p>Start with the <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021/dnr-executive-summary">extended

Several will be much taller than the existing buildings.</p><p>The two storey Birks Grange Village refectory, which was built in 1965, will be demolished and replaced with a six storey student accommodation block.</p><p>Five of the fifteen Birks Grange Village accommodation blocks, which were built between 2005 and 2011, will be renovated to improve their energy efficiency, while the university Estate Services Centre will also be demolished and replaced with a three and four storey accommodation block. The Estate Services Centre will be relocated to a new 3.5 acre site on the north side of the campus near the Belvidere Meadows nature reserve.</p><p>In total, twelve accommodation blocks, three other large buildings and a range of other structures such as bike and bin stores will be demolished to make way for new construction.</p><p>The university <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KFuCEbKLqay6zYDXCnF3agBw1g/2/693030/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">describes the project</a> as “an opportunity to develop an exemplar of environmentally sustainable buildings; moving well beyond statutory compliance to provide a new standard of low-carbon student accommodation”.</p><p>However, apart from one <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KrqPQVdNtIsq7zl534A87q3pErsn3Bz/2/693077/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">three</a> and one <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KrItuFkhKQQQAK6BzBNY7ZNTOOiOy/2/693053/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">five page</a> report submitted with the <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/02/08/university-of-exeter-streatham-campus-clydesdale-birks-student-accommodation-development-outline-application/">university’s planning applications</a>, which provide outline energy consumption estimates for some of the planned new buildings and summary descriptions of their Passivhaus design, no further assessment of the development’s carbon footprint has been performed.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="clydesdale-nash-and-birks-grange-village-redevelopment-demolition-plan.jpg" alt="Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment demolition plan" width="1524" height="1080"> <a href="clydesdale-nash-and-birks-grange-village-redevelopment-demolition-plan.jpg" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment demolition plan.

It sets out mandatory principles, regulations and supporting guidance for the interpretation and implementation of the EN 15978 methodology, a European Standard for assessing and reporting the environmental performance of a building which has also been adopted in the UK.</p><p>The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) then published <a href="https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/knowledge-landing-page/riba-launches-whole-life-carbon-assessment-guide">its guide to the RICS methodology</a>, which it called “the most comprehensive and consistent approach available to the industry”, in 2018, and the UK Green Building Council followed with a <a href="https://www.ukgbc.org/ukgbc-work/net-zero-carbon-buildings-a-framework-definition/">framework definition for net zero carbon buildings</a> in 2019. RICS launched its <a href="https://www.rics.org/uk/products/data-products/insights/rics-building-carbon-database/">Building Carbon Database</a> later the same year.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img class="imageborder" src="construction-carbon-lifecycle-diagram.jpg" alt="Construction carbon lifecycle diagram" width="1024" height="368"> <a href="construction-carbon-lifecycle-diagram.jpg" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Construction carbon lifecycle diagram.

The council could instead have spent this time developing a new Exeter Local Plan, which would almost certainly have been adopted by now, complete with policies requiring high specification whole life carbon assessments for all major development schemes.</p><p>However there are ways in which the council could have introduced such policies, and still could introduce them, without waiting for the local plan development process and causing further delay while the city’s carbon footprint continues to grow.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="university-of-exeter-clydesdale-court-student-accommodation.jpg" alt="University of Exeter Clydesdale Court student accommodation" width="800" height="450"> University of Exeter Clydesdale Court student accommodation buildings - earmarked for demolition</p><p>All planning decisions <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/determining-a-planning-application#how-decisions-on-applications">must take</a> what are known as “material considerations” into account. These do not carry the same weight as fully-fledged local plan policies, but can nevertheless inform development application decisions by council officers and planning committees.</p><p>The scope of what can constitute material considerations is very wide: they include the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework">National Planning Policy Framework</a> but also include local planning policies, other council policies and other locally-produced documents which are not formal policies. Relevant material considerations also differ for each development proposal.</p><p>The 2010 <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents/university-of-exeter-streatham-campus-masterplan-framework-spd/">University of Exeter Streatham campus masterplan framework</a> is an example of a local planning policy which was relevant in this case. It is this that contains the single sentence (among a hundred pages) which Exeter City Council cited to <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s78881/20-1684-OUT%20-%20FINAL%20Report.pdf">justify describing</a> the Clydesdale area of the campus as “a brownfield site where re-development is to be expected and encouraged”.</p><p>The council’s <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/4786/physical-activity-strategy-july-2019.pdf">physical activity strategy</a> and its <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5440/recovery-report-website.pdf">post-COVID economic recovery plan</a> could constitute material considerations in planning decisions, despite not being local planning policies, as could multi-stakeholder documents such as the <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/4463/strategy-overview-document-proof-1.pdf">Greater Exeter industrial strategy</a> and even the “<a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/4460/liveable-exeter-a-transformational-housing-delivery-programme-february-2019.pdf">Liveable Exeter</a>” vision document, which is little more than a series of sketches and summary outlines.</p><p>The weight of material considerations is affected by the weight of evidence supporting the document in question, and the relevance of issues to which it refers. If a document refers to an issue which is material to a particular development application, it could be considered appropriate to include it in decision-making.</p><p>Manchester City Council, for example, adopted a <a href="https://democracy.manchester.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=17815">policy on co-living in the city</a> which it introduced as a material planning consideration on an interim basis despite itself being in the middle of a new local plan development process. The council introduced it simply by approving it at one of its meetings. The policy subsequently helped the council prioritise the city’s interests in deciding applications to build co-living blocks.</p><p>In the same way, a policy approved by Exeter City Council concerning whole life carbon assessment of construction in the city could become a material consideration in planning decisions, particularly if that policy was supported by substantive evidence.</p><p>The <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/07/21/net-zero-exeter-2030-plan-part-one-exeters-carbon-footprint-exeter-city-futures-exeter-city-council-fridays-for-future-climate-activists/">Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan</a>, which was adopted by the council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=2028">last year</a>, and the evidence which underpins it, could certainly constitute material consideration in planning decisions to which its content was relevant.</p><p>There has also been debate in planning policy circles over whether the climate emergency in general could be referenced robustly in planning decisions, although it is not yet clear how much weight such references would have.</p><p>Nevertheless, when the city council adopted the Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan it did so “as council policy to inform all policy documents, plans and corporate decision making in response to the climate emergency and in pursuance of the goal to make Exeter a carbon neutral city by 2030”, exactly as the city council planning officer said in <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s78881/20-1684-OUT%20-%20FINAL%20Report.pdf">his report</a> on the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment application.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="university-of-exeter-clydesdale-rise-student-residences.jpg" alt="University of Exeter Clydesdale Rise student residences" width="800" height="450"> University of Exeter Clydesdale Rise student accommodation buildings - earmarked for demolition</p><p>Unfortunately, rather than setting out a commitment to require whole life carbon assessment of all development in the city, or satisfy BREEAM Outstanding criteria, the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s74046/TheNetZeroExeter2030Plan%20003.pdf">Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan</a> only says that the city council should “refine local planning policy so that it requires the highest energy efficiency standards (e.g. passive) in all new domestic, industrial, commercial and public buildings”.</p><p>It says the council should do this by the end of 2022. As CP15 already requires all non-domestic development to be zero carbon, we should presume this aim is intended to apply to domestic buildings. However, as the new Exeter Local Plan timetable recently made clear, the council has no intention of putting such policy in place by the end of next year.</p><p>And while the Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan also says that the council could “align all statutory and non-statutory plans, policies and guidance (including the local plan and planning policies) with the ambitions of achieving net zero carbon emissions”, it does not say that it should, or define a deadline by when this would need to happen for the city to decarbonise by 2030.</p><p>The city council nevertheless recently affirmed its commitment to comprehensive policy change by <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=51839">expressing support</a> for the <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/57374/climate-and-ecological-emergency-bill">Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill</a> tabled in Parliament by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. (The timing of its declaration, just before May’s local elections, was presumably a coincidence.)</p><p>Among other things, <a href="https://www.ceebill.uk/bill">the bill</a>, which was drafted with the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGDyke/status/1385128115014455298">James Dyke</a> of the University of Exeter Global Systems Institute, aims to bind the UK to take “every possible step to avoid, limit - and where limiting is not possible - compensate for the adverse impacts of United Kingdom-generated cycles of consumption, trade and production on ecosystems and human health; including, but not limited to, the extraction of raw materials, deforestation, land degradation, pollution and waste production”.</p><p>The bill is not yet law, but it does offer standards against which the “Exeter Vision 2040”, part of <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5362/our-strategy-autumn-2020-update.pdf">the council’s corporate strategy</a>, might usefully be measured.

And the adoption of such policies is well under way in councils around the country too.</p><p>We asked the council how it is able to make planning decisions which are consistent with its policies without such assessments.</p><p>The council said that planning applications are determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations, which include the National Planning Policy Framework, indicate otherwise.</p><p>It directed us towards policies CP13, CP14 and CP15 and said that the planning officer’s report on the application addresses both the development plan policies and any other relevant material considerations.</p><p>It said it “informally” encourages developers to incorporate low carbon and other sustainability principles into their schemes, which it said the university has done in relation to this scheme, and said it “already takes [these] issues seriously”.</p><p>When asked if it would like to further comment, the council said: “We would reiterate the proactive steps we are taking in striving to be a leading city in delivering sustainable and inclusive growth.</p><p>“This is repeatedly demonstrated through the council’s own development projects – including the development of St Sidwell’s Point – where the council is clearly leading by example and striving to set the tone for future low carbon developments in the city.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="university-of-exeter-birks-grange-refectory.jpg" alt="University of Exeter Birks Grange refectory" width="800" height="450"> University of Exeter Birks Grange refectory buildings - earmarked for demolition</p><p class="uk-dropcap">Rather than following its own policy to build at “BREEAM Excellent” or better, reaffirmed by its own academic experts less than a month before its application to redevelop the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village student accommodation sites, the university has chosen to adopt an approach which does not cover most aspects of the environmental performance of a building.</p><p>Rather than striving to reach the standards required by “BREEAM Outstanding”, or the RICS whole life carbon assessment methodology which RIBA describes as “the most comprehensive and consistent approach available to the industry”, the university appears to be backing away from its aim to adopt “best practice standards” for “environmental and energy performance of buildings” and “life cycle thinking and analysis in the evaluation of savings to achieve lowest environmental and carbon footprint from [its] actions and decisions”.</p><p>In so doing, the university apparently intends to ignore the impact of demolishing 30 buildings, several of which are less than 20 years old, to build new accommodation blocks at heights which are difficult to construct without extensive use of carbon-intensive concrete and steel.</p><p>While some of the accommodation blocks on the development site will be refurbished to improve their energy efficiency, no rationale is offered for the decision not to approach all the existing buildings this way, other than the university’s desire to cram another 1,250 student bedrooms into this corner of the Streatham campus.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/6856476"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>And it is doing all this with the approval of the city council, despite its own local plan policy requirement that all non-domestic development should have met the “BREEAM Excellent” standard since 2013, and been zero carbon since 2019, and the relevant material considerations set out in other council policies.</p><p>At <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=6752&amp;EVT=101&amp;DT=M">its June scrutiny meeting</a> the council was asked to explain the extent to which assessments of the embodied carbon emissions from new development, including emissions from demolition of properties on the development site, are taken into account when determining planning applications.</p><p>Councillor Emma Morse, the portfolio holder for city development, said that the council does not assess the carbon emissions embodied in development. She said the council does not have development plan policies relating to this area of assessment, despite the content of core policy CP15. She also said that there is no national planning policy requirement to make this type of assessment nor any national planning policy guidance relating to it.</p><p>She did not say that neither the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2">National Planning Policy Framework</a> nor the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/planning-practice-guidance">planning practice guidance</a> prevent local planning authorities setting such standards for development, nor developers meeting such standards in delivery.</p><p>The portfolio holder was then asked whether the council recognised that the absence of such assessment will make it difficult to achieve the Net Zero Exeter 2030 target. She deferred her answer, then replied in writing, saying that the council “is leading by example in terms of promoting sustainable, high quality development”.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="university-of-exeter-streatham-campus.jpg" alt="University of Exeter Streatham campus" width="800" height="450"> University of Exeter</p><p>Decisions such as these, the detail of which is obscured behind headline claims about the scale and scope of their ambitions, tell us much more about the university’s and city’s priorities in practice than their policies do in principle.</p><p>As the <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/2021/06/24/time-is-running-out-for-realistic-climate-commitments/">Committee on Climate Change has just warned</a>, time is running out, and every month of inaction makes it harder to get on track. The UK is neither on course to meet its carbon budgets nor its emissions targets, while irrevocable climate tipping points are <a href="https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2021/06/28/when-will-climate-tipping-points-actually-tip/">approaching much faster than expected</a> and extreme weather events are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/02/canadian-inferno-northern-heat-exceeds-worst-case-climate-models">exceeding worst-case climate science scenarios</a>.</p><p>Construction is only one of many contexts in which action is needed now. The university is not prevented from taking such action by inadequate council planning policy and should not be prevented from doing so by the indifference of its estates team to its policy commitments. The council is not limited by its failure to introduce needed policy more quickly and should, at least, be enforcing its existing policies.</p><aside class="insert"><form id="insertsubscribeform" class="form" action="" method="POST"><p>The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox</p><input class="snarefortheunwary" type="text" name="snarefortheunwary" value="" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"><div class="uk-grid-small" uk-grid=""><div class="uk-width-expand@s"><input class="uk-input" type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" required=""></div><div class="uk-width-auto@s"><button class="uk-button uk-width-1-1" id="insertsubscribeformbutton" type="submit" value="submit">Subscribe free</button></div></div><p>Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>-compliant <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><div id="insertsubscribeformmessages"></div></form></aside><p>In many ways the city council’s most significant powers are as local planning authority. Will it, and the university, which professes similarly world-leading climate ambitions, deliver on their existing promises then go further, as they say they will, by striving for the highest possible environmental standards in all development in which they have a hand?</p><p>The size, scale and impact of the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village student accommodation redevelopment makes it an important test of their resolve. The university has the opportunity to bring forward detailed design proposals which go much further than those it submitted at outline application stage, and the city has the opportunity to demand that it does so. Whether either acts will speak volumes about their willingness to practice what they preach.</p></article><hr class="uk-divider-icon"><p class="sharelinks">Share this with your networks: <a

The message was simple: we have to cut our carbon emissions rapidly and we have to cut them now.</p><p>It is in this context that Exeter’s Green Party councillors have <a href="https://exeter.greenparty.org.uk/news/2021/11/03/greens-demand-clear-evidence-of-exeters-path-to-net-zero/">called for a carbon budget for the city</a>, based on properly calculated baseline emissions and specifying the annual reductions required to meet its decarbonisation goals.</p><p>They are also calling for an annual report which demonstrates progress towards these goals and evaluates the degree to which the city’s existing decarbonisation plan, the Net Zero Exeter plan produced by Exeter City Futures, is contributing towards them.</p><p>Councillor Diana Moore said: “In 2019 the UN called for a 7.6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions every year between 2020 and 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5°C. However, we simply have no idea if Exeter has made any progress towards that goal.”</p><p>Councillor Amy Sparling added: “Just as we need international agreements to succeed we must also take a rigorous approach locally. We believe that a carbon budget for the city is an important evidence-based approach.”</p><p>In this article we consider the approach taken by Exeter City Council and Exeter City Futures thus far, look at emerging criticisms of “net zero” policies and outline what a proper carbon budget-based emissions reduction plan for Exeter might look like.</p><p>We also suggest that, should the council and its partners want Exeter “to be recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”, as they claim, it is high time that they consulted some of the city’s many climate scientists on how to frame such a plan.</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="cop26">COP26</h3><p>The 26th Conference of the Parties (the UN member countries, EU and a few small non-UN member countries which support the 1992 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Framework_Convention_on_Climate_Change">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> agreed at the Rio Earth Summit) is taking place in Glasgow until 12 November.</p><p>Its main task is produce realistic plans to reduce global carbon emissions to levels that limit global warming to as close to 1.5°C as possible.</p><p>This target was decided at the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement">2015 Paris COP</a>, which agreed to “limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels” by reaching a global greenhouse gas emissions peak “as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century”. It took 23 years to achieve this agreement.</p><p>The principal emissions reduction mechanism to deliver these aims is the Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country. The UK’s most recent NDC commits it to reducing emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.</p><p>However last week the <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021">UN warned</a> that we are on course for 2.7°C of warming and said current pledges will only produce reductions of 7.5% by 2030, far less than the 45% cut scientists say is necessary to meet the 1.5°C target.</p><p>If emissions don’t fall very rapidly, very soon, too much carbon will already have been added to the atmosphere to prevent dangerous climate change.</p></aside><p class="uk-dropcap">In July 2019, the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=5802">city council commissioned</a> Exeter City Futures to conduct a full audit of the city’s current carbon emissions to identify its “baseline state” as well as to “highlight gaps between current plans and what is required to achieve zero carbon”.</p><p>This audit was a key component of the city’s response to the climate emergency: the decision to commission it was discussed and approved at no fewer than four city council meetings.</p><p>Exeter City Futures had said it would assemble an academic team with the requisite specialist expertise to establish a “robust definition of what is included in the measurement of Exeter’s carbon emissions” and “how this accounts for the carbon emissions created in the wider region by commuters” as well as a measurement framework to make sense of all the data.</p><p>However it <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=750&amp;MId=6472">later admitted</a>, in a December 2019 progress report, that it did not have the “resource capacity” to deliver the promised audit. Nor did it assemble an expert academic team to define the city’s carbon footprint or produce the framework.</p><p>The <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=750&amp;MId=6472">council committee</a> which considered the report had nothing to say about these failures.</p><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: link; ratio: 2"></span> <img data-src="exeter-city-futures-net-zero-exeter-2030-plan-cover.png" alt="Exeter City Futures Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan cover" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s74046/TheNetZeroExeter2030Plan%20003.pdf" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div><p>While the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s74046/TheNetZeroExeter2030Plan%20003.pdf">Net Zero Exeter plan</a> that Exeter City Futures subsequently produced, and which the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=6253">council adopted in July last year</a>, acknowledged that “a more comprehensive assessment of the carbon cost will need to be undertaken”, the total of all projected carbon savings from the actions it proposed amount to <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/07/21/net-zero-exeter-2030-plan-part-one-exeters-carbon-footprint-exeter-city-futures-exeter-city-council-fridays-for-future-climate-activists/">just 329,000 tonnes</a> of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).</p><p>The lack of alignment between the plan’s proposed actions and Exeter’s emissions is reflected in its presentation: almost all the actions it proposes are framed as vaguely-defined activities, rather than focussed on specific outcomes, and very few include quantifiable measures of success.</p><p>The plan does not mention the impact of Exeter Airport. A <a href="https://devoncc.sharepoint.com/sites/PublicDocs/Environment/Environment/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FPublicDocs%2FEnvironment%2FEnvironment%2FEnergy%20and%20Climate%20Change%2FNet%20Zero%20Devon%20%28Final%29%20%281%29%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FPublicDocs%2FEnvironment%2FEnvironment%2FEnergy%20and%20Climate%20Change&amp;p=true">University of Exeter study</a> estimated the airport’s 2016 emissions as around 9% of Devon’s total transport emissions. This suggests it was responsible for more than 200,000tCO2e of emissions in 2019 alone.</p><p>Nor does the plan address the consumption habits of Exeter’s residents. In 2016 the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/netzeroandthedifferentofficialmeasuresoftheuksgreenhousegasemissions/2019-07-24#other-official-measures-of-the-uks-greenhouse-gas-emissions">ONS estimated</a> that 40% of the UK’s carbon footprint related to imported emissions while <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint">DEFRA found</a> the proportion had risen to 43% two years later.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="exeter-city-council-climate-credentials-claim-hoarding.jpg" alt="Exeter City Council climate credentials claim hoarding" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Exeter City Council climate credentials claim on St Sidwells Point development hoarding</p><p>Following its adoption, Exeter City Futures commissioned a review of the Net Zero Exeter plan by engineering consultants WSP which assessed ten of the plan’s “priority actions”.</p><p>The primary recommendation of the WSP report, which has not been published, was that a baseline model of Exeter’s greenhouse gas emissions should be created to “allow better analysis and comparison of actions, as well as mapping of ‘business as usual’ and tracking of progress”.</p><p>Its feedback included that “clarity would be useful on why goals are chosen” and that the overall carbon emissions reduction claims needed “recalculating”.</p><p>The Net Zero Exeter plan acknowledges that it has limitations, and that it is incomplete work in progress that requires further input and development. However an update was promised by December 2020 and there is still no sign of it nearly a year later.</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="cop-exe-4-6-november">COP-EXE 4-6 November</h3><p>Three days of Exeter events in tandem with COP26</p><p><strong>Thursday 4 November, 10:00am-6:30pm</strong></p><p>Drop in showcase at <a href="https://www.maketank.org.uk/">MakeTank</a> of local organisations who are seeking to address the climate and ecological emergency with a <a href="https://twitter.com/MakeTankExeter/status/1455951315885043718">photo exhibition</a>, creative activities and discussion opportunities plus a short talk by and Q&amp;A with Professor James Dyke at 2:00pm.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Friday 5 November, 11:00am-3:00pm</span> <strong>CANCELLED</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.fffexeter.co.uk/">Fridays for Future Exeter</a> are holding a demonstration with speeches at Bedford Place followed by an open mic music and poetry session at Cathedral Green from 1:00pm.</p><p><strong>Saturday 6 November, 10:00am-3:00pm</strong></p><p>Venues around the city centre will host themed drop-ins offering ideas for action around climate change:</p><ul><li><a href="https://stsidwells.org.uk/">St Sidwell’s Community Centre</a> (Sidwell Street) - biodiversity with <a href="https://www.devonwildlifetrust.org/">Devon Wildlife Trust</a> and <a href="https://www.exeterseedbank.co.uk/">Exeter Seedbank</a></li><li><a href="https://www.maketank.org.uk/">MakeTank</a> (Paris Street) - COP26, campaigning and political engagement</li><li><a href="https://www.parishofcentralexeter.co.uk/visiting-our-churches/st-stephens-church/">St Stephen’s Church</a> (High Street) - a faith-based response to the climate crisis</li><li><a href="https://www.parishofcentralexeter.co.uk/visiting-our-churches/st-petrock-church/">St Petrock’s Church</a> (High Street) - finance, divestment and getting your voice heard</li><li><a href="http://themint.org.uk/">The Mint Methodist Church Centre</a> (Fore Street) - sustainable lifestyle with <a href="https://goodfoodexeter.co.uk/">Good Food Exeter</a>, <a href="https://www.foodcycle.org.uk/location/Exeter/">Exeter Food Cycle</a> and other local sustainable businesses.</li></ul></aside><p class="uk-dropcap">Since Exeter City Futures <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/07/21/net-zero-exeter-2030-plan-part-one-exeters-carbon-footprint-exeter-city-futures-exeter-city-council-fridays-for-future-climate-activists/">unilaterally decided</a> to adopt the term “net zero” to describe Exeter’s decarbonisation plan, against the wishes of city councillors, the term has become the subject of significant criticism.</p><p>In April <a href="https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=James_Dyke">James Dyke</a>, Assistant Director of the <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/gsi/">Global Systems Institute</a> at the University of Exeter, co-authored a <a href="https://theconversation.com/climate-scientists-concept-of-net-zero-is-a-dangerous-trap-157368">landmark article</a> criticising the concept of net zero as a “dangerous trap” that “has licensed a recklessly cavalier ‘burn now, pay later’ approach which has seen carbon emissions continue to soar”.</p><p>The article’s authors said: “Current net zero policies will not keep warming to within 1.5°C because they were never intended to. They were and still are driven by a need to protect business as usual, not the climate.</p><p>“If we want to keep people safe then large and sustained cuts to carbon emissions need to happen now.

Instead the city council and its partner organisations, the council leader and its chief executive, several Exeter Labour councillors and many others <a href="https://twitter.com/ExeCityFutures/status/1385594505571835906/retweets/with_comments">repeated the claim in turn</a>.</p><p><img data-src="exeter-city-futures-carbon-footprint-claim-tweet.png" alt="Exeter City Futures carbon footprint claim tweet" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""></p><p>However a cursory examination of the research on which the claim was based turned up several significant issues which would equate (using normative fact-checking methods) to it being somewhere between half true (partially accurate but omitting important details or taking things out of context) and mostly false (containing an element of truth but ignoring facts that would give a different impression).</p><p>First, the area identified as “Exeter” is more than 75 miles wide, stretching from Axminster to Bude, and covering a population of 410,000.</p><p>Second, research survey respondents were self-selecting, and constituted just 0.68% of the area’s population. No attempt was made to make their responses more representative via demographic weighting or other techniques.</p><p>Third, the survey simply captured changes in self-reported behaviour over time. No attempt was made to benchmark survey results against available carbon footprint estimates.</p><p>Fourth, perhaps most striking of all, the research concluded that Exeter’s carbon footprint was 11.6tCO2e per person per annum, which would make the city’s total carbon footprint more than 1.5 million tCO2e each year.</p><p>This is nearly 1.2 million tCO2e more than the 329,000tCO2e accounted for in the Net Zero Exeter plan, which would mean that all the carbon savings from the actions it proposes put together would equal less than a quarter of the city’s total emissions.</p><p><img data-src="devon-climate-emergency-response-group-quote-retweet.png" alt="Devon Climate Emergency Response Group quote retweet" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""></p><p>We can also see limited understanding of decarbonisation policy detail in Exeter City Council’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=6597&amp;EVT=101&amp;DT=A">recent decision</a> to scrap its apparent goal of achieving carbon neutral operations by 2022.</p><p>The decision was taken not only on the basis that the goal was deemed “unachievable” but also that the council hadn’t actually <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=51898">passed a resolution to achieve it in the first place</a>.</p><p>The goal had been on the council’s risk register <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s81102/Item%209%20Committee%20Risk%20Register%20Final%20Appendix.pdf">since November 2019</a>, since when it has been repeatedly reviewed. It seems the council had been confusing its energy policy with an (apparently non-existent) decarbonisation plan for the previous two years.</p><p>At the same meeting at which the confusion was discovered, Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell and Conservative councillor Anne Jobson proposed a new risk register item to monitor the council’s ability to meet the 2030 decarbonisation target set for the city.</p><p>While the meeting agreed the proposal, the council said it would not be able to deliver it <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=51898">until March next year</a>.</p><p>This is in stark contrast with the claims made by Councillor Rachel Sutton, Executive Portfolio Holder for Net Zero Exeter 2030, in October last year, when <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=50553">she said</a> that Exeter was “in the vanguard of this nationwide challenge” and was “one of the few councils in the country to have set out a road map that was both deliverable and practical”.</p><p>These followed a <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/council-puts-fighting-climate-change-at-the-top-of-its-agenda/">press release</a> in which the council said it had put fighting climate change “at the top of its agenda”, quoting a pledge by Council Leader Phil Bialyk that the “ambition of creating a net zero carbon city by 2030 will be at the heart of everything the council does going forward”.</p><p>Perhaps the use of the word “ambition” is revealing? Its Latin root <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/ambition">means</a> “to go around (canvassing for votes)”.</p><p>Meanwhile the city council and <a href="https://www.exetercityfutures.com/">its partners</a> continue <a href="https://www.globalcityfutures.com/case-study/delivering-a-carbon-neutral-exeter/">to claim</a>, repeatedly, in <a

roadmap to carbon neutrality”?</p><p>First and foremost, as previously identified (and promised), it needs a “robust definition of what is included in the measurement of Exeter’s carbon emissions”.</p><p>The <a href="https://climate-change.data.gov.uk/emissions">UK government uses three key official measures</a> of UK greenhouse gas emissions. <a

cover emissions by UK residents and UK-registered businesses, whether in the UK or overseas, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint">DEFRA carbon footprint estimates</a> account for the emissions of all goods and services consumed in the UK wherever they are produced in the world.</p><p>Of these, carbon footprint estimates provide the most comprehensive emissions accounting basis, but methodologies used to produce them vary and are still being refined.</p><p>In their <a

councillors cite a University of Exeter study commissioned by the Devon County Council-led Climate Emergency Response Group to quantify the county’s carbon emissions at <a

as much as a third of the city’s total, meaning the true figure is likely to be more than a million tonnes each year.</p><p>This conclusion is borne out by another, similar, consumption-based

href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5362/our-strategy-autumn-2020-update.pdf">Exeter City Council’s commitment</a> to the so-called “Exeter Vision 2040”, in which it and its partners commit to being “recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”, it is clear that it does not have the answers to all of these problems.</p><p>But it is also clear that the council still has a very limited understanding of what reducing Exeter’s carbon emissions to sustainable levels would actually involve.</p><p>Instead of <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=512&amp;MId=6596">thinking of itself</a> as “municipal entrepreneur, ring master and story teller” and trying to pass off the presence of significant climate science expertise in the city as a proxy for its claims about the Net Zero Exeter plan, it would do well to live up to its ostensible “analytical city” status by adopting an evidence-based carbon budget.</p><p>The embarrassment of climate science riches on its doorstep provides it with all the resources it could ever need to get to the bottom of its methodological options and create a new, improved decarbonisation plan for Exeter.</p><p>Such a plan could present a truly ground-breaking local carbon budget, based on the facts of the matter, and a sophisticated policy-making framework in turn, complete with rigorous measurement and reporting methods to keep it on track.</p><p>Instead of disguising the enormity of the challenge that confronts us for the sake of political expediency by relying on net zero rhetoric and partial, arbitrary targets that the city can neither measure nor meet, it could also grasp the fact that the principal route to preventing runaway climate change is actually cutting carbon emissions, rapidly and immediately.</p><p>Then the city could legitimately claim some of the global leadership status to which its rhetoric tends but which the reality, sadly, currently does not.</p><hr class="uk-divider-icon"><p><strong>CORRECTION:</strong> This story was updated on 12 November to reflect the fact that

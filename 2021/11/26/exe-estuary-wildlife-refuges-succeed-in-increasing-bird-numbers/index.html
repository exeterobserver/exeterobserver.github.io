Boundary markers were installed asking members of the public to voluntarily refrain from entering the refuges during active periods, which differ at the two sites.</p><p>Dawlish Warren is active all year round, while the Exmouth reserve is only active from mid-September through to the end of December, a period which corresponds with migratory birds using the site for overwintering.</p><p>Wardens were also available as sources of information and guidance at the refuges, which together comprise 7% of the Exe Estuary and were chosen for their value to bird communities.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="oystercatchers-and-godwits-in-exe-estuary.jpg" alt="Oystercatchers and godwits in Exe Estuary" width="1920" height="1080"> <a href="oystercatchers-and-godwits-in-exe-estuary.jpg" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Oystercatchers and godwits in Exe Estuary. Photo: Joe Harrison.</p><p>The study found that the wildlife refuges significantly reduced disturbance to protected bird species, while confirming that they are located in the right places and cover the most critical times of year.</p><p>It also found that the decrease in human activity resulted both from “reasonable levels of compliance” with the restrictions by members of the public and lower footfall during coronavirus pandemic lockdown periods, although there were increases in human activity during holiday periods too.</p><p>Maximum wildfowl numbers at the Exmouth refuge increased each year during the course of the study and total wildfowl numbers increased at the Dawlish Warren refuge, implying that both sites are becoming more important for birds over time.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="black-tailed-godwit-in-exe-estuary.jpg" alt="Black-tailed godwit in Exe Estuary" width="1920" height="1080"> <a href="black-tailed-godwit-in-exe-estuary.jpg" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Black-tailed godwit in Exe Estuary.

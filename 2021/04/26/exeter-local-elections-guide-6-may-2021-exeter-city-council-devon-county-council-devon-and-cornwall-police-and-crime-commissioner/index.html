They have been arranged this way since <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/65/made">boundary changes</a> prompted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Exeter_City_Council_election">exceptional election</a> of the whole council at the same time in 2016.</p><p>A third of the seats, one in each ward, is normally contested in each of three years, with county council elections then held in the fourth year. Each city councillor thus normally serves a four year term.</p><p>However the 2016 elections used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_non-transferable_vote">multiple non-transferable vote</a> system to allow the council to return to electing by thirds in 2018. Voters cast up to three votes, with the candidate who received the most votes in each ward serving a four year term, the runner-up a three year term and the third place candidate a two year term.</p><p>The thirteen Exeter City Council seats occupied by the councillors who gained the most votes in the 2016 local elections are being contested this year. These councillors would have served a four year term but have ended up serving a five year term because the pandemic delayed last year’s ballot. Each new councillor will be therefore be elected for a shortened three year term to allow a subsequent return to the usual electoral cycle.</p><p>Voters in the city’s Mincinglake &amp; Whipton ward will also elect an additional councillor, following <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/tributes-paid-to-exeter-city-councillor-judy-pattison/">the death of Councillor Judy Pattison</a>. The candidate in that ward who receives the most votes will serve a three year term and the runner-up the remaining year of Councillor Pattison’s term.</p><div><span uk-icon="icon: link; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="exeter-city-council-election-results-map-2016.jpg" alt="2016 Exeter City Council election results map" width="800" height="1017"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Exeter_City_Council_election"></a></div><p class="caption">2016 Exeter City Council election results.

However the situation is less straightforward than it seems.</p><p>Rachel Lyons, who was first elected as an Exeter city councillor more than twenty years ago, recently eschewed the Labour Party, since when she has been designated as an Independent. She is not standing for re-election in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Olwen Foggin is also standing down, in Heavitree, which she has held for Labour since 2014. She will instead contest St Loyes, a Conservative stronghold for the past decade where all three ward councillors currently represent the party. David Henson, who was first elected in 1983, is standing down. Anne Jobson hopes to successfully defend the seat.</p><p>Robert Lamb, the Labour candidate who gained the most votes in St Thomas in 2016 and was thus elected to serve for four years, was <a href="https://twitter.com/exeterobserver/status/1384872428669636616">disqualified from the city council last Wednesday</a> after not attending any of the meetings at which he was expected for six months. He was absent without submitting apologies from thirteen of seventeen meetings at which he was expected in the past year, and had an attendance record of 39% the previous year.</p><p>The runner-up in St David’s in 2016, a Labour candidate who was elected to serve a three year term, also subsequently stopped attending <a href="https://agreeninexeter.com/tag/councillot-lewis-keen/">almost all of the council meetings at which he was expected</a> after <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/tracked-down-man-dubbed-missing-2188561">moving to London in 2018</a>.</p><p>And Keith Owen, who was first elected as an Exeter Labour city councillor in 2012, is standing down in Duryard &amp; St James, where Exeter Liberal Democrats have won both of the past two elections, in 2018 and 2019.</p><div id="dc_wdiv" aria-live="polite" role="region" data-candidates="true" style="margin-top:40px;margin-bottom:40px"></div><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="https://widget.wheredoivote.co.uk/wdiv.js"></script><p class="dropcap">At the last city council elections in 2019 <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/05/03/exeter-labour-loses-city-centre-wards-local-elections/">all three city centre wards went to challengers</a>. Michael Mitchell won Duryard &amp; St James for the Liberal Democrats and community campaigner Jemima Moore won in Newtown &amp; St Leonard’s, <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/04/26/exeter-local-resident-stands-independent-candidate-exeter-elections/">standing as an Independent</a> after the city council closed Clifton Hill sports centre and earmarked the site for redevelopment.</p><p>At the same time Diana Moore won St David’s for Exeter Green Party <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/05/03/exeter-labour-loses-city-centre-wards-local-elections/">by a country mile</a>, polling the largest number of votes of any candidate standing in any ward (1455), the largest margin of victory across the city (659 votes) and the city’s largest vote share (55%).</p><p>These three subsequently formed the Progressive Group on Exeter City Council with Kevin Mitchell, who had held Duryard &amp; St James for the Liberal Democrats the previous year, as group leader. Since then they have together presented much of the effective opposition to Exeter City Council’s ruling Labour group, despite the Conservative group holding six seats to their four.</p><p>The Progressive Group has since decided to build on its cross-party consensus by standing uncontested by each other in six wards across the city. As a result Amy Sparling is standing in St David’s, Catherine Rees in Heavitree and Dan Grey in Newtown &amp; St Leonard’s (with Jemima Moore’s endorsement) for Exeter Green Party, and Will Aczel is standing in Duryard &amp; St James, Nigel Williams in Pennsylvania and Adrian Fullam, a previous Exeter City Council leader, in St Thomas for the Liberal Democrats.</p><p>Both parties have agreed to field candidates in all divisions in the Devon County Council elections so all voters who wish to can vote for each of them at these elections.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="exeter-city-council-electoral-wards.jpg" alt="Exeter City Council electoral wards map" width="1201" height="1427"> <a href="exeter-city-council-electoral-wards.jpg"></a></div></div><p class="caption">Exeter City Council electoral wards.

In 2019 Labour’s Trish Oliver beat Conservative Cynthia Thompson by just 15 votes, a margin of 0.6%. The previous year Labour’s Duncan Wood beat Conservative Keith Sparkes by 71 votes.</p><p>In 2016, when all three seats were elected at the same time, Labour took two and the Conservatives one, with less than a hundred votes separating all three winning candidates. In a by-election the previous year Conservative Cynthia Thompson beat Labour’s David Harvey by just six votes. In 2010 it was even tighter: four votes won the seat for Labour.</p><p>Pinhoe may turn out to be the closest contest in the city: Pennsylvania may be the most open. None of the candidates in the ward have previously been Exeter city councillors. The Liberal Democrats won there in 2010, the Conservatives in 2012 and 2014 and Labour in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>Meanwhile the sole Women’s Equality Party candidate in Exeter at these elections, Bea Gare, is standing in Duryard &amp; St James, and both Labour and Conservative leaders are defending their seats, Phil Bialyk in Exwick and Andrew Leadbetter in Topsham.</p><p>A full list of candidates is available via <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5535/summary-of-candidates-ecc-elections-6-may-2021.pdf">the city council website</a>.

They will serve a shortened three year term on the same basis as the Exeter city councillors elected that day.</p><p>Unlike the city and county council elections, police and crime commissioner elections are decided using the <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/supplementary-vote/">supplementary vote system</a>, provided there are more than two candidates.</p><p>Under this system, ballot papers present two columns of boxes alongside the candidates’ names. One column is for voters to mark their first choice candidate and the other a second choice. For the vote to be counted the elector must cast a first choice vote. In the second column the elector may also mark a cross next to their second choice candidate.</p><p>If a candidate receives more than 50%+1 of the first choice votes they are declared the winner. Otherwise the two candidates who achieve the highest number of first choice votes progress to a second stage in which the second choice votes from the ballot papers of candidates who have been eliminated after the first round of voting are then counted for the remaining two candidates.</p><p>The winning candidate is then the one with the highest number of votes after adding first and second choice votes together.</p><p>This is what happened at the last Devon &amp; Cornwall police and crime commissioner elections in 2016. There was no outright winner after all the first choise votes had been counted, so Conservative Alison Hernandez and Labour’s Gareth Derrick progressed to a second round in which more than 42,000 first choice votes which had been cast for four other candidates were redistributed on the basis of second choice preferences.</p><p>Alison Hernandez then won by a margin of 3794 votes, with 51.1% of the total against Gareth Derrick’s 48.9%.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="devon-and-cornwall-police-and-crime-commissioner-election-results-2016.png" alt="Devon &amp; Cornwall Police and Crime commissioner election results 2016" width="1791" height="779"> <a href="devon-and-cornwall-police-and-crime-commissioner-election-results-2016.png"></a></div></div><p class="caption">Devon &amp; Cornwall Police and Crime commissioner election results 2016.<br>Image: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_England_and_Wales_police_and_crime_commissioner_elections#Devon_and_Cornwall_Police">Wikipedia</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License">Creative Commons license</a></p><p>Alison Hernandez and Gareth Derrick, who is also a Plymouth city councillor, are both standing again at these elections, as are Liberal Democrat Brian Blake and Stuart Jackson of the Green Party.

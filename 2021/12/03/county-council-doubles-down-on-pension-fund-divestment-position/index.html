Many of these organisations, which include unitary, district, town and parish councils, education establishments and other public bodies, have declared climate emergencies, including Devon County Council which oversees the management of the fund.</p><p>Since February several protests have taken place demanding that the fund dispose of its fossil fuel company investments. In September, a protest camp pitched outside County Hall and a <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/09/17/fridays-for-future-exeter-youth-climate-strikers-devon-pension-fund-fossil-fuel-divestment/">large demonstration</a> led by <a href="https://www.fffexeter.co.uk/">Fridays for Future Exeter</a> and <a href="https://extinctionrebellionexeter.org/">Exeter Extinction Rebellion</a> took place while the county council’s <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=4278&amp;EVT=101&amp;DT=M">Investment and Pension Fund committee</a> met inside.</p><p>It was discussing whether to move Devon Pension Fund’s passive equity allocations to a set of investment portfolios which would only <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s36631/Passive%20Equities%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf">incrementally reduce</a> the fund’s fossil fuel investments, with no prospect of them being removed altogether.</p><p>Last Friday, the <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=187&amp;MId=4279">committee met again</a> to consider a motion brought by Green Party councillor <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1128">Jacqi Hodgson</a> proposing much more rapid divestment than the September meeting had agreed.</p><p>Rather than restricting itself to justifying its policies and simply dismissing Councillor Hodgson’s motion, as it might have done, the county council filleted the motion, replacing most of its content and all of its intent with statements that simply reasserted the council’s existing position.</p><p>Councillor Hodgson said: “I’ve got huge concerns about the rewriting of the motion presented. It completely undermines the basis of what my motion said.”</p><p>The difficulty for the county council in adopting this dubious manoeuvre is that, as the past six months have shown, its position on fossil fuel investment has become increasingly untenable.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="county-hall-jacqui-hodgson-talks-with-protestors.jpg" alt="Councillor Jacqui Hodgson talks with protestors at County Hall" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Councillor Jacqui Hodgson talks with protestors at County Hall.

Photo © <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/contributors/vanessa-miles/">Vanessa Miles</a>.</p><p>Devon Pension Fund investment in fossil fuel companies does not give it control over their operations partly because Devon Pension Fund does not directly own shares in these companies, but instead invests in pooled passive equity investment funds which own such shares to reduce fund management costs.</p><p>These funds are managed on Devon Pension Fund’s behalf by Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which directs voting on behalf of the shareholders for which it is responsible.</p><p>LGIM is Britain’s biggest fund manager, overseeing more than £1.2 trillion of assets. It is accountable to its fund unit holders, including Devon Pension Fund, in respect of such votes. But Devon Pension Fund’s holdings are relatively small, and LGIM has to consider all its investors when deciding how to vote, so Devon County Council investment policy has very little, if any, direct influence on which way LGIM votes on its behalf.</p><p>As the county treasurer said in a <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s36620/Investment%20Management%20Report%20170921.pdf">report</a> to September’s Investment and Pension Fund Committee, LGIM “come to their own conclusions on voting”.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="county-hall-protest-camp-protestors-banners.jpg" alt="County Hall protest camp banners" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> County Hall protest camp banners. Photo © <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/contributors/vanessa-miles/">Vanessa Miles</a>.</p><p>We can see the limits of the shareholder control Devon County Council claims in practice in votes that took place at the 2021 AGMs of the three fossil fuel companies in which Devon Pension Fund has most money invested: BP, Shell and ExxonMobil.</p><p>Fossil fuel industry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder">shareholder activist</a> group <a href="https://www.follow-this.org/">Follow This</a> submitted a <a href="https://www.follow-this.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CR2102-Shell-Climate-Targets-Resolution-2021.pdf">resolution</a> to BP’s AGM in May which challenged the company to set and publish greenhouse gas emissions targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement, covering all scopes including its suppliers and the consumption of its energy products.</p><p>BP’s board <a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-agm-notice-of-meeting-2021.pdf">recommended</a> that shareholders vote against the resolution, claiming that the company’s existing strategy was Paris Agreement-compliant despite its aim to reduce the “carbon intensity” of the products it sells by just 50% by 2050.</p><p>LGIM used the shares it manages on behalf of Devon Pension Fund, among many others, to vote with the board and against the Follow This resolution.</p><p>However when Devon Pension Fund’s investment managers instead pursue progressive outcomes, other shareholders may not. Follow This submitted a <a href="https://www.follow-this.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CR2102-Shell-Climate-Targets-Resolution-2021.pdf">similar motion</a> to Shell’s AGM the following week, which LGIM supported because it did not believe the company’s plan could “credibly claim alignment with a 1.5°C pathway”. But it <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s36620/Investment%20Management%20Report%20170921.pdf">lost the vote</a>.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="county-hall-protest-camp-no-future-fossil-fuels-banner.jpg" alt="County Hall protest camp banner" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> County Hall protest camp banner. Photo: <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/contributors/leigh-curtis/">Leigh Curtis</a>.</p><p>But when shareholders vote in favour of change companies may nevertheless continue as before, with their boards in the background and their CEOs in control.</p><p>At ExxonMobil’s 2021 AGM, a week after the Shell meeting, activist hedge fund <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_No._1">Engine No.1</a> proposed four new board members “with the intention of getting the company to take the issue of climate change more seriously”. Three were successfully elected with LGIM’s votes in support.</p><p>However ExxonMobil’s CEO subsequently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/28/exxon-ceo-accused-lying-climate-science-congressional-panel">declined</a> to make specific pledges or to stop lobbying against climate initiatives when directly asked to do so by the chair of a congressional oversight committee.</p><p>And a <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/The-Carbon-Policy-Footprint-Report-2021-670f36863e7859e1ad7848ec601dda97">recent report</a> by think tank InfluenceMap, which analysed the world’s 350 largest industrial companies and their industry associations to assess their impact on climate policy and regulations, confirmed that ExxonMobil is still the world’s most negatively influential global company on Paris-aligned climate policy.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="county-hall-protest-camp-business-as-usual-banner.jpg" alt="County Hall protest camp business as usual banner" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> County Hall protest camp.

Its CEO subsequently issued a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/spirit-shell-rise-challenge-ben-van-beurden/">defiant statement</a> in which he insisted the company had been playing a leading role in decarbonising the sector, questioned the Hague court ruling and confirmed the company would appeal against it.</p><p>He also said that the company expects to continue selling oil and gas products for “a long time to come” and said that it would not help the world “one bit” if it “stopped selling petrol and diesel today”.</p><p>He later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/29/shell-raises-dividend-soaring-oil-prices">confirmed</a> that the company had no intention of changing its strategy despite the court ruling, which applies only in the Netherlands in any case.</p><p>Shell has since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/28/shell-pledges-to-halve-emissions-by-2030-as-it-reports-lower-profits">set out a plan</a> to cut the emissions for which it is responsible by just 5% by 2030, a strategy which its CEO called “incredibly coherent”.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="bedford-square-youth-strike-for-climate-march-banner.jpg" alt="Youth Strike for Climate march banner in Bedford Square" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Youth Strike for Climate march in Bedford Square. Photo: <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/contributors/leigh-curtis/">Leigh Curtis</a>.</p><p>Where shareholder activism and legal intervention both fail, can the shareholder “engagement” of which the county council makes much instead influence the fossil company operations?</p><p>The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), of which Devon County Council is a member, undertakes such “engagement activity” on its behalf.</p><p>How did LAPFF respond to Shell’s reaction to the Hague judgement? <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s36620/Investment%20Management%20Report%20170921.pdf">It said</a> it would “engage with the incoming chair”. What was the consequence of this engagement? It said the <em>outcome</em> of the sole meeting it had held with Shell was “dialogue”.</p><p>Nor did it make any impact on the other major fossil fuel companies in which Devon Pension Fund invests. It said it was “awaiting response” after seeking a meeting with BP, and recorded no attempt to meet with ExxonMobil at all.</p><p>As Councillor Hodgson pointed out, the county council’s filleted version of her motion included the claim that “continued engagement has a significant role to play in achieving progress and combating climate change” but failed to “recognise that engagement isn’t likely to bring about any change in the fundamental business model of fossil fuel majors, and has not done so in the past”.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="topsham-road-protest-march-cars.jpg" alt="Topsham Road protest march with cars" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Topsham Road protest march.

Three weeks before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">COP26</a> the government <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/three-weeks-to-cop26-government-wins-oil-case-arguing-oil-emissions-not-relevant-to-climate/">won a court challenge</a> to its decision to grant a permit to BP to drill for 30 million barrels of oil in the North Sea after its lawyers argued that carbon emissions from burning oil extracted by BP are “not relevant” when granting such permits.</p><p>Indeed, as the county solicitor admitted in a <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s38930/NOM%20Briefing%20CSO2116%20Investment.pdf">briefing note</a> to last week’s Investment and Pension Fund committee, “engagement” with fossil fuel companies is just as unlikely to stop them polluting as divestment.</p><p>And as the county council acknowledges, revenues are a far more significant driver of fossil fuel company operational activity than investment. The county solicitor <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s38930/NOM%20Briefing%20CSO2116%20Investment.pdf">cited</a> Shell as an example, pointing out that the company has raised no new capital through share issues for the past four years but has received £1.219 trillion in revenues.</p><p>She also observed that reducing demand for its products is the key to depriving Shell of resources, something which Devon Pension Fund cannot influence via shareholder activism, lobbying or any other means.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="county-hall-protest-speeches.jpg" alt="County Hall protest speeches" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> County Hall protest speeches.

We need that pool of companies that are net zero if we are going to have net zero portfolios. At the moment we are relying on the companies to actually take action if we are to achieve that. We cannot control that.”</p><p>Aside from the acknowledgement that Devon County Council cannot control the decarbonisation strategies of companies in which it invests, echoed from the county solicitor’s <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s38930/NOM%20Briefing%20CSO2116%20Investment.pdf">briefing note</a>, this statement fails to discriminate between companies which are not engaged in fossil fuel production but whose operations nevertheless still produce some greenhouse gases, and companies whose business models are the discovery, extraction, production and sale of fossil fuels for combustion.</p><p>Similarly, Councillor <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=219">James O’Dwyer</a> said: “Full disinvestment, I believe, leaves us with a reduced amount of businesses we could invest with and would present an increased risk to the whole fund”. Is there so little choice of global investment options that divestment from fossil fuel companies would put Devon Pension Fund more at risk than its continuing investment in those companies already does?</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="bedford-square-devon-county-council-stop-funding-fossil-fuel-companies-banner.jpg" alt="Protestors hold Devon County Council stop funding fossil fuel companies banner in Bedford Square" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Protestors hold banner in Bedford Square.

The committee members have a legal duty, as Councillor Hodgson’s motion pointed out, to treat the fund’s members “fairly as between them”. This means, among other things, seriously considering the long-term interests of younger members, who are more likely to be significantly affected by climate change than older members.</p><p>And there is no legal barrier to a pension fund selling off its fossil fuel investments. According to trade body the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_and_Lifetime_Savings_Association">Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association</a>, which represents 1,300 pension funds, the fidicuiary duty of trustees to ensure the best returns for pension fund members is consistent with divestment on financial grounds.</p><p>These include the increasing risk of oil and gas company assets being rendered worthless as investors exit the sector, something former Bank of England governer Mark Carney has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/climate-stranded-assets-show-the-need-for-rapid-energy-transition-carney-says.html">repeatedly warned</a> about.</p><p>Most committee members also seem oblivious to the wishes of those Devon Pension Fund members who want the fund to divest simply so their pensions do not depend on active participation in fossil fuel exploration, extraction, production and combustion.</p><aside class="insert"><form id="subscribeform" class="form" action="" method="POST"><p>Subscribe to The Exeter Digest, Exeter Observer's essential free email newsletter.</p><input class="snarefortheunwary" type="text" name="snarefortheunwary" value="" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"><div class="uk-grid-small" uk-grid=""><div class="uk-width-expand"><input class="uk-input" type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" required=""></div><div class="uk-width-auto"><button class="uk-button" id="subscribeformbutton" type="submit" value="submit">Subscribe free</button></div></div><p>Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>-compliant <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><div id="subscribeformmessages"></div></form></aside><p>Councillor Hodgson quoted one pension fund member, who said: “I’ve worked for South Hams District Council for over twenty years in practical conservation and engaging communities with their environment. I cannot base the comfort of my retirement on the destruction of the global environment and the futures of generations to come, and of our own two children.”</p><p>Councillor <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5740">Henry Gent</a> echoed her point, saying some pension fund members “simply didn’t want to own shares in fossil fuel companies”.</p><p>As the 130 MPs who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/08/climate-130-mps-call-pension-fund-divest-fossil-fuels">called</a> for the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund to divest from fossil fuels last month put it, they want to “ensure that [their] pensions are not funding climate disaster”.</p><p>Councillor Hodgson’s original motion proposed a poll of Devon Pension Fund members to seek their views on fossil fuel divestment, but the county council expunged the proposal, along with everything else in the motion which would entail a change in its position.</p><p>While Devon County Council continues to insist that fossil fuel investment will clean up the hydrocarbon sector, it seems the only option for fund members who don’t want their pension to depend on dirty money is to divest from the pension fund itself, a worst case scenario for individual members which the committee nevertheless appears to embrace.</p><p>Unfortunately those who are already drawing their pensions are prohibited from doing so.</p></article><hr class="uk-divider-icon"><p class="contributor"><a rel="author" href="https://exeterobserver.org/contributors/martin-redfern">Martin

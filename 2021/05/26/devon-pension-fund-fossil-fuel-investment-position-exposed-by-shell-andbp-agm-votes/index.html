About two thirds of the funds are invested in oil and gas and about a third in coal. The Devon fund was identified among the largest fossil fuel investors, with nearly 4% of its money invested this way: its largest such holdings are around £36.5 million in Shell and £21 million in BP.</p><p><a href="https://www.devonpensionfund.org.uk/">Devon Pension Fund</a> currently has more than 39,000 actively contributing members, employed by 214 employers from unitary, district, town and parish councils, education establishments and other bodies in the region. Many of these organisations declared climate emergencies more than two years ago, including Devon County Council and Exeter City Council.</p><p>Both councils have also since passed <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/g3849/Printed%20minutes%2029th-Apr-2021%2014.15%20Council.pdf?T=1">formal</a> <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/g6858/Printed%20minutes%2027th-Apr-2021%2018.00%20Council.pdf?T=1">motions</a> in support of a <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/57374/climate-and-ecological-emergency-bill">Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill</a> tabled in Parliament by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas which seeks, among other increases in UK climate policy ambition, an end to the <a href="https://www.ceebill.uk/">extraction, export and import of fossil fuels</a>.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-sankey" data-src="visualisation/6245969"><script defer="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>Following the publication of the report, Devon County Council <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=187">Investment and Pension Fund committee</a> met <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=187&amp;MId=3958">to discuss</a> Devon Pension Fund’s <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s34572/Investment%20Strategy%20Statement.pdf">investment strategy</a>, and its climate change policies in particular.</p><p>It agreed to sign up to a commitment framed by the <a href="https://www.iigcc.org/">Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change</a>, of which Devon County Council is a member, aimed at alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.parisalignedinvestment.org/media/2021/03/PAII-Net-Zero-Asset-Owner-Commitment-Statement.pdf">commitment</a> includes setting interim investment portfolio carbon reduction targets across all <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/">emissions scopes</a> and reducing the net greenhouse gas emissions of the portfolio to zero by 2050 or sooner.</p><p>The Devon Pension Fund investment strategy also said this included actively “promoting emissions reductions at the companies invested in” but the <a href="https://www.parisalignedinvestment.org/media/2021/03/PAII-Net-Zero-Asset-Owner-Commitment-Statement.pdf">IIGCC commitment</a> does not contain those words, although it does refer to the <a href="https://www.parisalignedinvestment.org/">Paris Aligned Investment Initiative</a>’s <a href="https://www.parisalignedinvestment.org/media/2021/03/PAII_Net-Zero-Investment-Framework-1.0_Implementation-Guide.pdf">Net Zero Investment Framework</a> which proposes strategic asset allocation, policy advocacy and market engagement among its approaches.</p><p>The county council subsequently issued a <a href="https://www.devonnewscentre.info/devon-pension-fund-net-zero-pledge/">statement</a> summarising the new pension fund climate change investment strategy. Then Councillor Ray Bloxham, who was chair of the council’s investment and pension fund committee at the time, emphasised the strategy’s shareholder activist perspective. He said:</p><p>“Simply pulling the plug on investing in carbon intensive industries isn’t the answer because they are inextricably linked to the very industries that are working to find sustainable solutions.</p><p>“To give an example, the steel industry is carbon intensive but is also vital in the production of the wind turbines we need to increase the supply of renewable energy.</p><p>“To achieve real emissions reductions, it is vital we engage with the companies we are invested in, to hold them to take responsibility for their product throughout its usage, not just in its manufacture.”</p><p>We asked the county council to clarify these remarks. We were told that collective shareholder pressure aimed at company reduction of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions has more impact than divestment and will do more to tackle climate change.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="bp-petrol-station-on-the-wirral.jpg" alt="BP petrol station on the Wirral" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> BP petrol station on the Wirral.

She asked what steps were being taken to expedite the changes required by the Devon Pension Fund’s newly agreed commitment “to ensure the utmost expediency in divestment from fossil fuels, as this investment is undermining the Devon Carbon Plan and the opportunity to address and mitigate carbon emissions, and putting Devon County Council investments and pension funds at substantial risk”.</p><p>Ray Bloxham responded in his then role as chair of the council’s investment and pension fund committee. (He stood down at the May local elections, when Henry Gent <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/democracy/division2021/broadclyst/">won his seat</a> for the Green Party.) He said: “The fund is making a significant contribution towards the climate change agenda and is wholly aligned to the wider aspirations of the council. Disinvestment is not our preferred approach and I firmly believe that disinvestment does not help to respond to climate change one iota.</p><p>“Disinvestment from the companies listed would not stop those companies from operating but simply remove any influence we have as an influential investor. And we are having an influence. Shell are engaged in research into alternative fuels and BP are very much involved in renewables. Disinvestment would withdraw from that diversification.”</p><p>We asked the county council to give examples of ways in which specific operational decisions by Shell and BP which have led to measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have been directly influenced by Devon Pension Fund. We were told that shareholder engagement with Shell and BP has had a significant impact on the approach of both companies.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="london-gateway-port-with-oil-pipeline-terminal.jpg" alt="London Gateway port with oil pipeline terminal" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> London Gateway port with oil pipeline terminal.

In the business community some still like it because it seems to offer, in comparison to other scenarios, a relatively easy way out of the climate crisis. Our analysis shows, however, that there are no easy ways out.”</p><p>Shell has since published a revised version of what its calls its “<a href="https://www.shell.com/investors/annual-general-meeting/_jcr_content/par/textimage_d70a_copy.stream/1618407326759/7c3d5b317351891d2383b3e9f1e511997e516639/shell-energy-transition-strategy-2021.pdf">energy transition strategy</a>”. It is based on reducing the “carbon intensity” of the energy it produces by diversifying into other activities while modestly decreasing its oil production in favour of expansion of its gas business.</p><p>However this approach allows continuing high or even increasing greenhouse gas emissions levels while diluting the overall proportion of emissions, meaning the company’s absolute emissions could fall by as little as 10% over the next ten years.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="shell-gas-station-in-connecticut.jpg" alt="Shell gas station in Connecticut" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Shell gas station in Connecticut.

They said:</p><p>“Analysis of the latest plans show the company will attempt to meet its self-declared targets while freezing emissions at more or less the same level as today. In fact, it’s currently forecasting an increase in gas production and gas exports to global markets.</p><p>“Rather than reducing its emissions, Shell plans to offset gigatonnes of emissions by planting trees to capture carbon. It says that reforestation and other nature-based technology will be enough to allow its expanding operations. But Shell’s Sky scenario requires a forest the size of Brazil to offset the volume of carbon it intends to continue pumping out.</p><p>“Offsetting carbon emissions with forest growth at this scale is a dangerous fantasy. Science tells us it is simply not possible to substitute carbon emissions from coal, oil and gas, with unstable ‘green’ carbon sinks in trees and soil. While offsetting with nature-based solutions and techniques for carbon dioxide removal is necessary, it should only be used to offset residual, difficult to abate sectors like agriculture and aviation.</p><p>“Shell sees oil and gas playing a role in our global economy for many decades to come. Science says that is simply not feasible if we want to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.”</p><p>BP is in a similar position. While it was the first major oil company to truly change course, partly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-21/bp-investors-back-climate-change-proposal-amid-activist-pressure">as a result of shareholder pressure</a>, announcing in <a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/from-international-oil-company-to-integrated-energy-company-bp-sets-out-strategy-for-decade-of-delivery-towards-net-zero-ambition.html">August last year</a> that it would reduce its oil and gas production by 40% by 2030 (compared to 2019 levels), its “<a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/sustainability/getting-to-net-zero.html">getting to net zero</a>” aims nevertheless rely on the same “carbon intensity” approach taken by Shell.</p><p>And it only intends to halve the “carbon intensity” of the greenhouse gas emissions from its scope three energy product sales by 2050, which is why the company’s investor-led <a href="https://www.climateaction100.org/company/bp/">CA100+ assessment</a> concludes its corporate strategy remains incompatible with the Paris Agreement.</p><p>BP will <a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/investors/upstream-major-projects.html#azeri">start up</a> seven major new hydrocarbon production projects in 2022, with at least three more following in 2023 or later.

These funds are managed on Devon Pension Fund’s behalf by Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which directs voting on behalf of the shareholders for which it is responsible. LGIM is Britain’s biggest fund manager, overseeing more than £1.2 trillion of assets. It is accountable to its fund unit holders, including Devon County Council, in respect of such votes.</p><p>At the BP Annual General Meeting on 12 May, a Dutch fossil fuel industry shareholder activist group called <a href="https://www.follow-this.org/">Follow This</a> submitted a <a href="https://www.follow-this.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CR2102-Shell-Climate-Targets-Resolution-2021.pdf">resolution</a> which challenged the company to set and publish greenhouse gas emissions targets that are consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement, covering all scopes including its suppliers and the consumption of its energy products.</p><p>BP’s board <a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-agm-notice-of-meeting-2021.pdf">recommended</a> that shareholders vote against the resolution, claiming that the company’s existing strategy was Paris Agreement-compliant despite its scope three aim to reduce the “carbon intensity” of the products it sells by just 50% by 2050.</p><p>LGIM voted with the board and against the Follow This resolution, although the resolution did receive the support of <a href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/investors/bp-agm-poll-results-2021.pdf">20.7% of the company’s shareholders</a>, an increase of 12.3% since the 2019 AGM. The activist group’s founder, Mark van Baal, said: “Oil major boards rarely take the initiative to move on their own. The shareholders have to compel them to set targets, and have to support them to attain these targets.”</p><p>We asked Devon County Council why LGIM did not vote in favour of this resolution on Devon Pensions Fund’s behalf. A spokesperson said that as BP had set targets which “appear consistent” with the Paris Agreement it was “unclear what additional action the company could take”.</p><p>Then, at the Shell AGM on 18 May, Follow This, which first began co-ordinating investors around these issues at the company’s 2016 AGM, put forward a <a href="https://www.follow-this.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CR2102-Shell-Climate-Targets-Resolution-2021.pdf">similar Paris Agreement-aligned resolution</a> in direct challenge to a competing <a href="https://www.shell.com/investors/annual-general-meeting/_jcr_content/par/textimage_d70a_copy.stream/1619711756022/3b46f95118374a334947d6ac4c7122684be9d195/notice-of-meeting-2021.pdf">board-proposed</a> resolution supporting the company’s revised <a href="https://www.shell.com/investors/annual-general-meeting/_jcr_content/par/textimage_d70a_copy.stream/1618407326759/7c3d5b317351891d2383b3e9f1e511997e516639/shell-energy-transition-strategy-2021.pdf">“energy transition strategy”</a>.</p><p>Just over 11% of Shell’s shareholders voted against the board’s strategy, while the Follow This resolution received <a href="https://www.shell.com/investors/annual-general-meeting/_jcr_content/par/textimage_d70a_copy.stream/1621348944533/e31f2aa8ff0be567ea9577b43011bac4044f0e4e/voting-results-of-the-2021-agm.pdf">30.47% of the votes</a>, its support more than doubling since last year when 14.4% of shareholders voted in favour. In 2016 just 2.7% supported the Follow This motion. Under UK corporate governance rules, winning more than 20% of the votes means that the company is compelled to consult shareholders on the resolution’s content and report back within six months.</p><p>At this meeting LGIM voted against the board resolution and in favour of the Follow This resolution. It said it did so because it did not believe the company’s plan could “credibly claim alignment with a 1.5°C pathway”. However it said that while it backed the activist group “on this occasion”, it had reservations about its objective of using shareholder activism to turn oil and gas firms into renewable energy companies, saying a strategy of “managed decline” would be an equally viable option.</p><p>The investment management company’s <a href="https://www.lgim.com/landg-assets/lgim/_document-library/capabilities/esg-impact-report-q1-2021.pdf">recommendation for the oil and gas industry</a> is to focus primarily on reducing its own emissions (and production) in line with global climate targets before considering any potential diversification into clean energy.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="oil-refinery-in-pembrokeshire.jpg" alt="Oil refinery in Pembrokeshire" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Oil refinery in Pembrokeshire.

As this story went to press ExxonMobil was facing a shareholder rebellion backed by the company’s largest shareholder aimed at dislodging board members, and Chevron shareholders were about to vote on another Follow This resolution aimed at cutting its carbon emissions.</p><p>However it is nevertheless clear that while increasing support for such interventions has put climate change higher up oil company agendas, both BP and Shell, in which Devon Pension Fund has invested £57 million, are still pursuing corporate strategies that are incompatible with the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Neither currently plan to become predominantly renewable energy companies, there are limits on the influence their shareholders can bring to bear, their management are both incentivised and obliged to maximise their profits, and the world can no longer wait for them to change course voluntarily.</p><p>It may be that the only means by which the fossil fuel industry might meet the Paris Agreement targets, at least insofar as the UK can influence it, would be corporate governance reform legislation which forces the City of London into alignment with the government’s professed climate change leadership position.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.maplecroft.com/insights/analysis/g20-disorderly-transition-all-but-inevitable-even-climate-leading-uk-at-risk/">report published today</a> by risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft suggest that this may be the direction of travel, even though policy-makers currently appear unaware of their destination.</p><p>It warns that none of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20 countries</a> are on track to meet their climate goals, and that there is “no longer any realistic chance of an orderly transition” to a low-carbon future for global financial markets because political leaders will be forced to rely on “handbrake” policy interventions to cut emissions.</p><p>The report’s authors said: “These conditions will leave businesses in carbon-intense sectors facing the most disorderly of transitions to a low-carbon economy, with [restrictive] measures imposed with little warning.</p><p>“Companies and investors across all asset classes must prepare for at best a disorderly transition and at worst a whiplash from a succession of rapid shifts in policy across a host of vulnerable sectors.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="oil-refinery-near-the-river-tees.jpg" alt="Oil Refinery near the River Tees" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Oil refinery near the River Tees.

Roger Cox, the campaign group’s lawyer said: “This is a turning point in history. This case is unique because it is the first time a judge has ordered a large polluting corporation to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement. This ruling may also have major consequences for other big polluters.”</p><p>Shell has been ordered to comply with the judgement immediately, but nevertheless plans to appeal against the decision, which will only apply in the Netherlands. However it raises the possibility that similar cases could be brought in other legal jurisdictions if corporations do not comply with the Paris Agreement and governments will not intervene to compel them to do so.</p><hr class="uk-divider-icon"><p><strong>UPDATE II:</strong> We have now received confirmation from Devon County Council of how Legal &amp; General Investment Management voted on behalf of Devon Pension Fund at the Chevron and ExxonMobil AGMs which were held after this story went to press.</p><p>LGIM voted among a 61% majority in favour of the Follow This proposal at the Chevron AGM, which will force the company to reduce its emissions faster than it planned, and in favour of all four reforming ExxonMobil board candidates proposed by activist hedge fund Engine No.1 as well as against the retention of the company’s CEO.</p><p>Three of the four reforming candidates, who are all experienced oil industry executives, were elected to the board to pursue a profit-oriented, risk-focussed climate action agenda, but CEO Darren Woods retained his position. ExxonMobil is not only o<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions">ne of the world’s biggest contributors to the climate crisis</a>, it is also the <a href="https://www.minderoo.org/plastic-waste-makers-index/">world’s greatest single-use plastic waste polluter</a>.</p><p>Since then Shell CEO Ben van Beurden has issued a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/spirit-shell-rise-challenge-ben-van-beurden/">defiant statement</a> in which he insisted the company had been playing a leading role in decarbonising the sector, questioned the Hague court ruling and confirmed the company would appeal.</p><p>He also said that the company expects to continue selling oil and gas products for “a long time to come” and said that it would not help the world “one bit” if Shell “stopped selling petrol and diesel today”. Rather, he said, his company’s customers should “find their own pathways to achieve net-zero emissions” and invited governments to intervene with policies and regulation.</p></article><hr class="uk-divider-icon"><p class="contributor"><a rel="author" href="https://exeterobserver.org/contributors/martin-redfern">Martin Redfern</a>&nbsp;is editor of Exeter Observer and a director of its publisher Exeter Observer Limited.</p><p class="sharelinks">Share this with your networks:&nbsp; <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Devon Pension Fund fossil fuel investment position exposed by Shell and BP AGM votes%20via=exeterobserver&url=https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/26/devon-pension-fund-fossil-fuel-investment-position-exposed-by-shell-andbp-agm-votes/" class="uk-icon-button" uk-icon="twitter" uk-tooltip="title: Share this story on Twitter; pos: bottom"></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/26/devon-pension-fund-fossil-fuel-investment-position-exposed-by-shell-andbp-agm-votes/" class="uk-icon-button" uk-icon="facebook" uk-tooltip="title: Share this story on Facebook; pos: bottom"></a> <a href="https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/26/devon-pension-fund-fossil-fuel-investment-position-exposed-by-shell-andbp-agm-votes/&title=Devon Pension Fund fossil fuel investment position exposed by Shell and BP AGM votes" class="uk-icon-button" uk-icon="reddit" uk-tooltip="title: Share this story on Reddit; pos: bottom"></a> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/26/devon-pension-fund-fossil-fuel-investment-position-exposed-by-shell-andbp-agm-votes/&title=Devon Pension Fund fossil fuel investment position exposed by Shell and BP AGM votes&summary=Shareholder support for Paris Agreement-compatible goals increases but fails to prevent continuing oil and gas exploration, extraction, production or consumption as experts intensify warnings that emissions reductions goals will be missed.&source=https://exeterobserver.org" class="uk-icon-button" uk-icon="linkedin" uk-tooltip="title: Share this story on LinkenIn; pos: bottom"></a> <a href="mailto:?subject=Devon Pension Fund fossil fuel investment position exposed by Shell and BP AGM votes%20in%20Exeter Observer&body=https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/26/devon-pension-fund-fossil-fuel-investment-position-exposed-by-shell-andbp-agm-votes/" class="uk-icon-button" uk-icon="mail" uk-tooltip="title: Share this story via email; pos: bottom"></a></p></main></div><div class="uk-width-1-1 uk-width-1-3@m"><h5 class="uk-heading-line uk-hidden@m"><span>Community share offer</span></h5><h6 class="uk-heading-bullet uk-visible@m"><span>Community share offer</span></h6><div uk-sticky="media: 960; offset: 0; bottom: true"><aside class="box invest"><h5>Invest in local news that matters</h5><p>Help publish the independent journalism Exeter needs<span class="uk-hidden@m"> in the community-owned newspaper it deserves</span></p><div class="progress"><div class="amount"><strong id="number">£47,050</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;invested</div><span class="target">£75,000 target</span> <span class="percent">62.7% raised</span><div class="meter"><span style="width: 62.7%;"><span class="bar"></span></span></div><span class="time">Final extension: 12 days left</span> <span class="investors">30 investors</span></div><p>50% tax relief &mdash; claim back half your investment and keep all your shares</p><a class="uk-button" href="https://exeterobserver.org/invest/">Invest in Exeter Observer<span uk-icon="icon: play; ratio: 1.5"></span></a></aside><div class="newswirepreviews"><h5 class="uk-heading-line uk-hidden@m"><span>Exeter in brief</span></h5><h6 class="uk-heading-bullet uk-visible@m"><span>Exeter in brief</span></h6><p class="previewdate"><time datetime="2023-06-15 14:00:00 +0100">Thursday 15 June 2023</time></p><div class="uk-column-1-2@s uk-hidden@m"><div><p>Planning permission to rebuild the <strong>ROYAL CLARENCE HOTEL</strong> as <a href="https://publicaccess.exeter.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=R7NEIPHBLWX00">residential flats with ground floor commercial units</a> has <a href="https://publicaccess.exeter.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=R7NEJ0HBLWY00">still not been granted</a> more than eight months after the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=56519">city council approved the plans</a>.

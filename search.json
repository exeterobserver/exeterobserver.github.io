"content" : "St Sidwell’s Community Centre and Wren Music are co-hosting an evening wassail with music, singing and free hot soup on Friday 19th January.Orchard wassailing has been practised in cider-producing counties, including Devon, for many centuries. The first recorded mention is from 1585 in Kent.The winter ceremony is believed to promote a good apple crop the following spring. The tradition has also been revived locally in Stoke Gabriel and Sandford.Wren Music is a charity based in Okehampton. Founded in 1983 it runs events, workshops and concerts enabling communities to participate in folk and traditional music.St Sidwell’s Community Centre, which opened in 2001, is an independent, secular charity which offers a range of activities, events and services for the local community.It runs a community café, a bakery and cookery school and free English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes.The centre also manages a large community garden, where events are held and organic fruit and vegetables are grown for use in the café, offers meeting rooms for hire to local groups and acts as a local heritage hub for Exeter city centre’s eastern quarter.There are volunteering and work experience opportunities across all areas of the centre’s work.

"content" : "Devon County Council has adopted an electric vehicle charging strategy which aims to meet increased demand for charging points and accelerate electric vehicle uptake “within the context of an overall shift away from the use of the private car”.The WSP-produced strategy, on which the county council intends to rely to meet its net zero goals as local transport authority, was approved at a meeting of the county council cabinet on Wednesday.The number of ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs), which the government defines as road-using vehicles that are reported to emit less than 75g of carbon dioxide from the tailpipe for every kilometre travelled, is rising across the UK.Such vehicles include petrol- and diesel-driven hybrids as well as fully electric vehicles. However none are emissions-free, either on a whole-life basis or in use. Significant amounts of particle pollution, in particular, is produced by car tyre wear.Devon electric vehicle charging strategy bar chart based on withdrawn figuresThe WSP strategy says that the number of private ULEVs in Devon (excluding Plymouth and Torbay, which have their own local transport authorities) increased from 668 in January 2016 to 6,482 in September 2021.It says a “large proportion” of these vehicles are based in Exeter but does not say how many.It bases these conclusions on Department for Transport figures that have been withdrawn because their postcode basis is considered inaccurate for this purpose, and which do not include any data beyond the end of 2021.Replacement Department for Transport statistics show that the number of ULEVs in the Devon local transport authority area actually rose from 618 to 5,984 during this period. The proportion of registered in Exeter rose from 17% of the total in 2016 to nearly 29% in 2021.The replacement statistics continue for two years beyond the withdrawn figures, to September last year.The number of ULEVs in Devon more than doubled during these two years to reach 12,883 of which just under 4,000 were registered in Exeter.The strategy forecasts that the number of electric vehicles in the Devon local transport authority area will exceed petrol and diesel vehicles by 2033.In September last year there were a total of 621,000 vehicles registered in the area, of which 458,400 were cars, 95,800 vans, 7,300 lorries and 2,500 buses and coaches.(Plymouth and Torbay add another 226,000 motor vehicles to the county’s roads, and the figures do not include traffic travelling into or through Devon, such as tourists.)The Devon local transport authority area ULEV ownership rate, at 2%, is much lower than the rate for the UK as whole, across which 3.5% of 41.3 million vehicles were ULEVs in September last year.The growth in local ULEV ownership is also lagging behind the UK. The WSP strategy nevertheless says that Devon has a higher rate of ULEV ownership than the UK average: six per thousand people (the metric used in the strategy) as opposed to four per thousand.The Devon local transport authority area ULEV ownership rate was actually 6.6 per thousand in mid-2021, the most recent year for which the ONS has provided full UK population estimates, while the UK ULEV ownership rate was 8.4 per thousand.The strategy fails to point out that, at the same time Devon had a lower rate of ULEV ownership than the UK average, it had a higher rate of overall motor vehicle ownership.There are more than 740 vehicles per thousand Devon local transport authority area residents, owned by a population of a little over 800,000 residents living in around 350,000 households, with an average ownership rate of 1.76 vehicles per household.This compares with 600 vehicles per thousand across the UK as a whole.However nearly 55,000 of these Devon households did not own a car or van, while nearly 44,000 owned three or more.The number of cars and vans in the Devon local transport authority area has also increased – by more than 70,000 between 2016 and last year – while the number of buses and coaches has remained the same.There are now 87,200 motor vehicles registered in Exeter alone.Not all the vehicles that fall under the government’s ULEV definition require charging points as they run entirely or mostly on petrol or diesel. In the Devon County Council local transport authority area 38% fall into this category.This means that the 383 publicly-accessible electric vehicle charging points that WSP identified in the county council area as of January 2022, of which 64 were in Exeter, were then supporting a fleet of just over 4,000 exclusively battery-powered electric vehicles.So there were then 95 publicly-accessible chargers for every thousand battery-powered vehicles.By September last year, this battery-powered fleet had nearly doubled in size to just under 8,000 vehicles. At the same time the number of publicly-accessible electric vehicle charging points in the area had increased to 528.But this means the number of publicly-accessible chargers per thousand battery-powered vehicles had fallen to 66.Only 26% of these chargers were rapid chargers, providing the 50kW and above which can replenish three-quarters of a typical EV battery in less than an hour. The rest take between six and eighteen hours to provide the same charge.While only around 10% of battery-powered vehicle charging takes place at publicly-accessible charging points, a July 2020 Devon electric vehicle survey found that 34% of battery-powered vehicle users said public chargers were occupied more than half the time.And 92% of the survey respondents reported that they found charging points were out of order when they wanted to use them.WSP acknowledges that forecasting battery-powered vehicle adoption rates is difficult given uncertainties around technological developments, behavioural change and government policy, legislation and subsidy levels.It nevertheless predicts that nearly 29% of Devon County Council local transport authority area vehicles – just under 180,000 if total vehicle ownership numbers remain stable – will be battery-powered by 2030. It describes this as a “mid-range” uptake scenario.At last year’s provision rate of 66 publicly-accessible chargers per thousand battery-powered vehicles, this would equate with nearly 12,000 chargers. And total Devon vehicle numbers are expected to keep increasing, which would equate to even higher demand.WSP nevertheless projects a need for just 4,600 publicly-accessible charging points by 2030.If only 4,600 publicly-accessible charging points were available for use by the 180,000 battery-powered vehicles WSP expects by 2030 there would be fewer than 26 chargers per thousand vehicles in the area.Wenea-delivered publicly-accessible charging points in Exeter. Image: Rapid Charging Devon.Devon County Council has so far installed 70 publicly-accessible charging points in partnership with private provider Wenea. 35 are in Exeter, twenty in Plymouth and 15 distributed across East Devon.Many provide only 30kW although the Rapid Charging Devon network still describes these as “rapid” chargers.The county council has also installed 80 charging points in public car parks via a £1.3 million project funded by the European Regional Development Fund.And it has recently been awarded £7 million of capital funding in the first tranche of the government’s Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) fund.It estimates that this will pay for approximately 2,000 publicly-accessible charging points.Its electric vehicle charging strategy expects the private sector to deliver most of the rest.The strategy also says it aims to ensure that the transition to battery-powered vehicles is “accessible for all and equitable”, while an accompanying county council officer’s report says that the “price of a new electric vehicle is expected to be the same as a new petrol or diesel car sometime between 2025 and 2027”.Figures from the AA show that home charging costs less than half as much as petrol per mile driven, but new battery-powered cars are currently more expensive to buy than their fossil fuel equivalents.Prices are nevertheless falling, and some battery models are reaching price parity with their fossil fuel equivalents on the second-hand market.However the county council still acknowledges that “those with higher incomes may be better placed to purchase an electric vehicle”, with 38% of the lowest-income households in Devon currently having no access to a car or van of any fuel type.And there are a range of other issues around the accessibility of electric vehicle ownership that the strategy also acknowledges without supplying ready solutions.One is the large number of motor vehicle users, including tourists and visitors, who do not have access to off-street parking for charging facilities.Solutions such as “pavement gullies” may be able to address problems with trailing cables in some locations. But not in many urban areas with little off-street parking provision where it is difficult to find a parking place at all, let alone one in front of your house.Another significant problem is electricity grid constraints. Western Power Distribution says there is a lack of grid and substation capacity in many parts of Devon, both in rural areas and in urban areas where the mains was installed after the second world war.When county councillors questioned officers about this issue they were told that the strategy had it covered, but the strategy only says that more investment will be needed without explaining where the money will come from.

The strategy is expected to meet the aims of the Devon Carbon Plan, which aims for a 50% reduction in all production and consumption greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050.However Devon’s emissions increased during 2021 despite a partial pandemic lockdown that suppressed production and consumption activity for the first five months of the year, and the proportion of these emissions that are produced by road transport is rising too.The electric vehicle charging strategy will also form part of a “suite of documents” that will inform Devon County Council’s new local transport plan, which will cover 2026-2040. This plan is expected to come forward for consultation in March.The county council says its approach “will ensure future compliance with the government’s expectation that local transport authorities produce local electric charging strategies.”"

"content" : "Five years ago next month Exeter City Council’s then-chief executive Karime Hassan unveiled his “Vision for a Transformational Housing Delivery Programme”, which was to build 11,000 new homes in the city over the following twenty years.“Liveable Exeter”, as the development scheme was called, was to create a “compact global city of linked neighbourhoods” on eight mostly brownfield sites, the largest of which would see 5,500 homes replacing most of Marsh Barton industrial estate.The scheme was also intended to address Exeter’s transport and housing affordability problems. It accompanied the council’s collaboration with Exeter City Futures, then still proposing to make Exeter “energy independent and congestion free by 2025”.The following May the government approved a joint council bid for £750,000 under its “garden communities” programme to pay for “dedicated project teams, master planning work and studies to anticipate and offset the impact of housing growth” that the Liveable Exeter scheme would entail.The scheme was accordingly rebranded as Liveable Exeter Garden City in July 2019, but despite receiving nearly £1.5 million in government funding awards it has yet to deliver a single new home.Exeter’s garden city status has since been expunged from the new Exeter Local Plan, which is intended to guide development in the city for the Liveable Exeter scheme’s lifespan.The new local plan nevertheless says that the “Liveable Exeter principles” it proposes as key strategic local planning policy have been “drawn from” from national garden city principles that the Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) has updated from their 19th century origins at the government’s behest.The Three Magnets: Diagram No. 1 from To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real ReformThe government said it wanted to renew Ebenezer Howard’s utopian vision for urban planning, aimed at creating beautiful, healthy and co-operative new communities, so “people could work, raise families, travel easily and enjoy green spaces” in new versions of Howard’s garden cities.Howard had set out his vision in To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform, published in 1898 while he was working for Hansard as a shorthand writer. The book was retitled Garden Cities of To-morrow in 1902.He was appalled by the condition of much Victorian housing for working people and wanted to see significant and radical change. Part of his motivation was that the new garden communities he envisaged could be a solution to a phenomenon that has persisted in various forms for centuries: the adverse impact of the economic and cultural differences between town and country.He proposed a type of settlement in which the benefits of both could be combined into what might today be called a “sustainable community”. As the TCPA put it nearly a century later:“Howard believed that by taking the best elements (or magnetic pulls) of the town (such as jobs, transport, social networks, and infrastructure) and the best elements of the countryside (such as space for agriculture, fresh air, and access to nature) and securing them “in perfect combination” in a new place (“town-country”) which provided high-quality affordable homes in well planned communities, it would be possible to achieve social justice and a better quality of life for all.”Garden City: Diagram No. 2 from To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real ReformThe first chapter of his book lays out what an ideal garden city might look like. It would be a broadly circular settlement, set within agricultural countryside alongside a main railway line.A population of some 32,000 people would live in houses with gardens arranged around a central park intersected by radial boulevards with workshops, factories and markets at its edge.The rest of Howard’s book is less about design and more about garden city financing and governance. A key aim was to secure development funding in such a way that residents had a permanent financial share in the community. The TCPA explains this as follows:“The land ownership (in today’s terms, the freehold) of the entire development would be retained by a limited-profit, semi-philanthropic body similar to a community interest company or trust: income earned from capitalising on the increasing land values which result from development – known as ‘betterment’ – and from residential and commercial leaseholders (with uplift on reversion at the end of lease periods) would be used to repay the original development finance debts.“As these debts were gradually paid off, and as land values rose, the money could be increasingly invested in community assets and services, building up what we might think of as the garden city ‘mini-welfare state’.”Ward and Centre: Diagram No. 3 from To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real ReformAs the TCPA says, Howard’s garden city concept was “sophisticated, radical and practical”, encompassing “planning, design, economics, sociology and environmentalism.” Unfortunately, however, his painstakingly worked-through ideas only briefly survived contact with the real world.Letchworth Garden City, begun in 1903 in rural Hertfordshire, has followed his development model most closely. The developer was a company established by the Garden City Association, founded immediately after publication of Howard’s book (and which eventually morphed into the TCPA).However it failed to raise sufficient start-up funds and so was unable to build houses or other facilities for more than ten years. Only middle-class families with the capital to build their own homes moved in and Howard’s utopian vision was not realised.Many of Howard’s ideas about sustainable, healthy, well-designed new communities nevertheless persisted, and now look prescient in the face of climate change.Westholm Green, Letchworth from The Historic England BlogIn 2011, the newly-elected coalition government invited the TCPA to “reinvent the garden city for the 21st century”. The following year the Prime Minister announced that the government would “apply the principles of garden cities to areas with high potential growth in places people want to live”.The TCPA’s work on distilling Howard’s ideas into a set of contemporary principles was accompanied by a range of research reports, guides and practical resources. These covered planning, investment, land assembly, delivery and long-term stewardship to enable the proposed renaissance of Howard’s vision.In 2014, the government began offering support for new settlements of 15,000 homes or more in a prospectus called Locally-led Garden Cities. Subsequent guidance broadened the scope of this support, inviting applications to develop garden villages of between 1,500 and 10,000 homes and garden towns and cities of more than 10,000 homes.This guidance was then superseded by another funding bid prospectus called Garden Communities in 2018. While the government hadn’t explained what it meant by “garden community” in either of the two previous documents, this time it said: “Each garden community we choose to assist will have its own clear and distinct sense of identity”.While it stopped short of making adherence to garden city principles a pre-requisite of participation in the programme, it nevertheless said that its plans were “not about creating dormitory towns, or places which just use ‘garden’ as a convenient label”.Instead it said they were “about setting clear expectations for the quality of the development and how this can be maintained (such as by following garden city principles).”It added: “We want to see vibrant, mixed-use, communities where people can live, work, and play for generations to come – communities which view themselves as the conservation areas of the future. Each will be holistically planned, self sustaining and characterful.”Thus far, Howard would almost certainly have approved. But then 21st century pragmatism takes over. The garden communities bidding prospectus continues: “Proposals can be for a discrete new settlement, or take the form of transformational development of an existing settlement.”October 2020 Garden communities programme map.

At the time the three authorities were still working together, with Mid Devon District Council, to develop the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan.(Although the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan was abandoned in August 2020 when East Devon withdrew, the funding would have supported its development.)The bid document framed the funding award as the “Exeter &amp;amp; East Devon Garden Communities” programme. It said: “A unique characteristic of the […] proposal is that it includes elements of both a free-standing new community and a transformational approach to development in Exeter and its environs.”However East Devon District Council did not rush to embrace garden community status. An October 2019 report made clear that it neither affected existing development delivery processes nor, in fact, had much to do with gardens either.Instead, it provided an “opportunity to engage with government and its agencies to identify investment priorities and other support needed to ensure that future growth and development is delivered to a set of high standard principles”.The report added: “Garden communities status will help to support this process both directly through additional revenue funding and indirectly through greater government support (referred to as ‘brokerage’) going forward.”2018 garden communities presentation by now-Exeter City Council development director Ian CollinsonEast Devon District Council subsequently promoted a “free-standing new community” of 8,000 homes in the first draft of its new local plan, published in November 2022.Described as “a second new town east of Exeter” (after Cranbrook) it was billed as providing an initial tranche of 2,500 homes by 2040 and a further 5,500 over the remainder of the century. It would also include employment provision, a town centre and social, leisure, health, community and education facilities.It prompted significant criticism, but East Devon District Council nevertheless decided in December last year to develop it on 1,300 acres of land between Exeter Airport on the A30 and Hill Barton Business Park on the A3052, east of Westpoint Arena.The “Exeter &amp;amp; East Devon Garden Communities” programme funding bid had promised that “Clyst Villages garden community will be a 21st century adaptation of the garden town”, adding that “the concept of separate and distinct ‘villages’ networked to provide the combined population and spending power of a town is central to our design approach.”However the “networked village” concept was not carried though into the draft East Devon local plan, nor do any of “garden community”, “garden city” or “garden town” appear.A comment in the October 2019 report explained why: “The discussion concept of a network of linked villages, referred to as Clyst Villages, was put forward in order to satisfy the requirements of the [government funding] application process”.East Devon new town location map. Source: East Devon District Council.Exeter City Council had no need to take a similarly cynical approach to obtaining funding under the government garden communities programme: its part of the bid was submitted under the “transformational development of an existing settlement” option.Karime Hassan suggested that the city should have first call on the money as the only council involved in the joint bid that would be able to make rapid progress on development delivery. He stressed the importance of proceeding “at pace” (an expression repeatedly used in his report) and being able to respond to changing circumstances in an “agile” fashion.He also proposed the creation of what he called Liveable Exeter Garden City Board to “ensure that momentum is maintained” and respond “as and when East Devon and our partners are in a position to commit to firm proposals”.The new board was to involve a “broad mix of partners” to expedite development delivery and provide “confidence for funding initiatives to be channelled through the structure”. It was to be “the vehicle through which Exeter will ensure that the desired transformational housing agenda known as Liveable Exeter Garden City is achieved”.The city council executive committee agreed. It recommended a council budget of “up to £750,000”, the whole garden communities programme grant including the other councils’ share, and the creation of the board.The proposed garden city board was renamed Liveable Exeter Place Board by the time it first met later that year.Land Trust garden community development of 3,000 homes at Beaulieu, near Chelmsford. Photo: TCPA.The city council was awarded another £475,000 in government garden city funding in June 2021 then a further £250,000 from the same source twelve months later, bringing the total allocated to the scheme’s development to £1,475,000.However the outline draft version of the new Exeter local plan that was published for public consultation in October 2022 only mentions Exeter’s “garden city” status once in around 28,000 words. It says the government awarded it “in recognition of our ambitious growth strategy”, not because the Liveable Exeter development scheme has anything to do with garden city principles.And by the time the full draft version of the plan that is currently out for consultation was published in October last year this reference to the Liveable Exeter scheme’s status had vanished from the plan’s now 48,000 words.Instead, the scheme is described as “a growth and city-making initiative” that is governed by seven Liveable Exeter “principles” which have been “drawn from” the Liveable Exeter Place Board’s “Exeter Vision 2040” (adopted back in 2019) and national garden city principles.However the Liveable Exeter principles that are proposed as strategic planning policy S2 in the full draft of the new Exeter Local Plan (and slightly extended in a related evidence base document) are not formed from the board’s “Exeter Vision 2040”, and it is this planning policy that will be used to determine applications for planning consent and so decide development delivery in the city.Exeter City Council new Exeter Local Plan full draft strategic policy S2: Liveable Exeter principlesThe TCPA describes its updated version of Howard’s original garden city principles as a “distillation” of “key elements” that “form an indivisible and interlocking framework” for 21st century development delivery.Comparing the proposed “Liveable Exeter principles” in the council’s full draft Exeter Local Plan with these national garden city principles shows that while some of what the council says echoes the TCPA’s updating of Howard’s ideals, there are some very substantial differences between them.For example, the TCPA stresses the importance of beautifully and imaginatively designed homes with gardens. Homes with gardens are not mentioned in the Liveable Exeter principles and the draft Exeter Local Plan, far from promoting such gardens, supports “developments in residential gardens”.The importance of community ownership of land and the long-term stewardship of assets is also at the centre of Howard’s vision and the TCPA update. Effective stewardship arrangements were put into practice in Letchworth where the residual assets of the original development company were incorporated into the Letchworth Garden City Heritage Foundation, a self-funding charity that reinvests for the long-term benefit of the local community.Endowment income generated mainly from its property portfolio enables the Heritage Foundation to provide additional services and facilities to those provided by the local authority, North Hertfordshire District Council. The Foundation has provided a cinema, a day hospital, a museum, a family farm, a community hub and more.It also operates a management scheme to protect the appearance of most of the residential parts of the town at no cost to local residents.Arts and crafts housing in Letchworth. Photo: TCPA.Stewardship only gets a single mention in the new Exeter Local Plan’s Liveable Exeter principles. It says a development will “ensure neighbourhoods function effectively in the long term by incorporating stewardship measures which provide for the effective management and maintenance of the public realm and communal private spaces”.The city council might like to argue that its ownership of a very significant proportion of the city’s land and property assets constitutes an effective form of stewardship, but this claim on comfort was recently bleakened by the prospect of the fire sales of Mary Arches Street car park and the site of the demolished Clifton Hill sports centre.Both TCPA garden city and Liveable Exeter principles also propose the construction of new affordable housing (although the council omits “genuinely” from its formulation) but developers – including Exeter City Living, the council’s own property development company – are well-versed in employing viability arguments to reduce the number of affordable homes in new developments.In Letchworth this problem is partially overcome by its Heritage Foundation arrangements, which apply to new development on Foundation-owned land and so lead to value generated by new development being reinvested back into the town and its community.In addition, foundation governors are elected by the local community, nominated by local groups and societies or appointed by the Heritage Foundation itself. The governors elect a board of trustees, the decision-making body, with two places reserved for nominees of the local councils.Exeter, in contrast, is a long-established settlement with standard local authority governance. Letchworth was built on green fields, but proposed Liveable Exeter development sites are all brownfield. A local housing market also already exists here, with rents and purchase prices among the least affordable in the country.  TCPA garden city vs Liveable Exeter principles  To what extent do the Liveable Exeter principles proposed as policy S2 in the full draft of the new Exeter Local include the national garden city principles as updated by the TCPA?

The weakest link between the TCPA garden city and Liveable Exeter principles is financing. This probably presents the most significant challenge to delivering garden city ideals via the Liveable Exeter development scheme among many it faces.Although the February 2019 city council report that launched the Liveable Exeter scheme did not mention it, Exeter City Futures had by then already been working on Exeter Development Fund as the means to finance the Liveable Exeter scheme for nearly eighteen months, with the council’s behind-the-scenes blessing.The fund, an outline of which was presented to the council’s Executive in July 2018, was supposed to use council-owned land and property assets as collateral to access private finance to pay for new development, while pooling as much government infrastructure money as possible into one citywide pot to make the fund big enough to be of interest to major institutional investors.In theory the fund would have been able to recycle its surpluses into other development projects across the city, not entirely unlike the way Letchworth Garden City Heritage Foundation creates local community wealth.However the fund’s model intended significant private profit based on universal rent extraction: none of the 12,000 new homes it proposed were intended for purchase. It was riddled with risks even before Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and interest rate rises rendered its financing and viability assumptions redundant.Nor could anyone answer basic questions about the fund’s governance when questioned, and no convincing mitigation for the risks involved in the council investing so many of its assets in an untested financing and delivery vehicle was provided either.Exeter Development Fund presentation slide – whose hand, whose money and is it going in or out?The development fund was supposed to come under greater scrutiny before going any further but a 2022 decision to set up a council committee working group was never implemented despite councillors voting in its favour.The council is nevertheless in the process of appointing consultants to follow through without Exeter City Futures’ demise giving it pause – because parent company Global City Futures, which was supplying all the staff that worked on the fund (and billing the council for them via its subsidiary) is still there, in the background, pursuing its interests in the scheme.Like Liveable Exeter garden city delivery, the development fund has not progressed “at pace”. Detailed proposals for the Southgate site that is being modelled for fund-financed development were expected last November, more than six years into the project. They did not appear, and the council has not said when it expects to bring them forward instead.The government has already awarded £1.2 million to finance the creation of Exeter Development Fund, on top of the £1.5 million garden city programme funding, so while the fund’s future seems far from certain, it may be that the council simply must try to save face in Whitehall by delivering at least one development site on this basis.Haven Banks redevelopment schemeHowever Exeter in 2024 is a long way from Letchworth over a century ago. Ebenezer Howard’s utopian ideals were diluted by financial reality and the Liveable Exeter principles may well go the same way.The deeply unpopular build to rent redevelopment scheme at Haven Banks is the first in the city to gain planning approval under the Liveable Exeter scheme’s banner. Its density and amenity levels are about as far from Howard’s garden city vision as they could be while community ownership and stewardship, as well as gardens, are nowhere in sight.Letchworth was built on green fields, aiming to marry town and country. Its developers did not have to contend with the challenges of urban redevelopment, in which demolition, contaminated land, historical remains and brownfield remediation measures conspire to push up costs before the first brick is laid.It is these costs which enable developers to tell the city council that however much they might want to provide more affordable housing it simply isn’t financially viable to do so."

"content" : "Among Phil Bialyk’s’ first acts after taking over as Exeter City Council leader in 2019 was to initiate a governance review with the express aim of reducing scrutiny of council decision-making. He commended the changes proposed by the governance review working group assembled for the purpose as “appropriate for an ambitious council looking to enhance the democratic process.”The changes included cutting the time for public questions at council meetings and public scrutiny of council proposals and preventing scrutiny committees from considering executive decisions before they had been made. They also included the creation of a new body, the Scrutiny Programme Board, to decide which issues would be scrutinised and when they would appear on the agendas of one or the other of the council’s two scrutiny committees.The board is composed of the chairs and vice-chairs of each of the committees, one of which addresses strategic issues, the other council spending and service delivery. The ruling political party takes the chairs of both, with opposition councillors as vice-chairs. In order to guarantee its majority on the board, the council leader also appoints the chair. This was Hannah Packham, the council leader’s wife, until she stood down at this year’s local elections. It is now Naima Allcock, who has just been rewarded for her efforts in the role with a new stipend.Local council scrutiny and the way it is managed might seem, at first sight, like the kind of topic in which only political insiders and policy nerds might take an interest. However when your council starts making a habit of spending millions of pounds of public money on high-risk schemes behind closed doors, much of it financed by borrowing, whether or not its decisions are being properly scrutinised becomes a more compelling question.In the four years since the Scrutiny Programme Board took over the city council has made numerous materially-significant decisions that have not been given proper scrutiny. These range from the council’s creation of the unelected Liveable Exeter Place Board, through its decision to allocate £55 million to buy back the Guildhall shopping centre leasehold to the secondment of the council chief executive and another director to work for Exeter City Futures.Then there’s the council’s expenditure on and governance arrangements with the company, which have never being properly accounted for or explained, the adoption of its subsequently discredited Net Zero Exeter plan, and the council’s agreements in relation to the company’s debt-driven Liveable Exeter property development financing scheme known as Exeter Development Fund.The council has also altered its Community Infrastructure Levy and student accommodation policies without properly factoring in the impact of the university’s extraordinary expansion or the developing local housing crisis that has accompanied it, and has taken umpteen decisions, many in private, amounting to potential expenditure of more than £104 million in relation to Exeter City Living, before finally deciding to all-but wind up the company.Local Government Act 2000 frontispieceThe legislation that underpins local government provides for council scrutiny as an essential safeguard against executive overreach. The accompanying statutory government guidance says that the role it plays in holding council decision-makers to account makes it “fundamentally important to the successful functioning of local democracy.”To enable backbench councillors that sit on scrutiny committees to fulfil this role they are afforded legal powers to “call in” decisions, delaying their implementation so they can be subjected to greater scrutiny, reconsidered and potentially overturned. These councillors, who must not be Executive committee members, also have enhanced powers to access confidential information, in addition to their rights under freedom of information legislation, and can investigate any issue which affects “the area or the area’s inhabitants”.To conduct investigations scrutiny councillors can choose from a variety of working practices. The government says these include single public meetings focussed on a key topic, sometimes known as “challenge panels”, short reviews conducted over two or three meetings, often called “task and finish working groups”, and longer versions of the same model that take six or seven meetings over several months and are typically called “spotlight reviews”.Scrutiny councillors can also set up permanent sub-committees which are often, but not always, known as “standing overview groups”. Their purpose is to “keep a watching brief over a critical local issue”, as the government puts it.Scrutiny councillors operating in all these modes, as well as when meeting in regular scrutiny committees, can call councillors, council officers and representatives of external bodies to attend and give evidence, like parliamentary select committees. Councillors and council officers are required to comply. The model for local council scrutiny that is proposed by Exeter City Council’s external auditor is the widely-admired House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. The witnesses it calls to give evidence are often intimidated by its reputation for uncovering the truth.Statutory government guidance on overview and scrutinyThe government guidance also says that local council scrutiny should concentrate on delivering work that is “of genuine value and relevance to the work of the wider authority”. It adds: “The executive should not try to exercise control over the work of the scrutiny committee. This could be direct, e.g. by purporting to ‘order’ scrutiny to look at, or not look at, certain issues, or indirect, e.g. through the use of the whip or as a tool of political patronage.” It repeats: “The executive should not direct scrutiny’s work.” Nevertheless, since the Scrutiny Programme Board took over, Executive committee members have directed council scrutiny work several times.In July 2020 the Executive committee decided that the Scrutiny Programme Board would “agree that work be undertaken by the relevant committee to investigate the continued appropriateness of the statue of General Buller”. Two days later the board created a task and finish working group that was charged with carrying out the Executive committee’s wishes. It met four times before recommending the relocation of the statue. A public consultation was to follow but was scrapped a few weeks later after Robert Jenrick, then local government secretary, said to no-one’s surprise that the government would overturn such decisions if it was so minded.Then in April last year the Scrutiny Programme Board again obliged when the council leader wanted a task and finish working group to review the council’s street naming and numbering policy. All the output report proposed was “minor revisions” to the policy. These included a “six year retention period on correspondence”, that “street names should not be more than 30 characters long” and that the council would “instruct developers to site street nameplates prior to the occupation of new properties”. The resulting policy subsequently took up space on two more council meeting agendas before being signed off.Then in December, at the behest of Executive committee member Duncan Wood, the Scrutiny Programme Board created another task and finish working group. This one was to ensure that food provided at internal council meetings would be “plant-based” and that “all council-run external sites including leisure centres, cafes and restaurants have plant-based options available”. It met four times earlier this year with unquantifiably small impact. A follow-up review was announced in May which will require even more of the council’s scarce scrutiny resources.Local Government Act 2000 section 9FWe know about the these decisions to bend scrutiny to executive will because they were made in public meetings. The Scrutiny Programme Board, however, meets in private.The local government legislation that lays out how council scrutiny works makes clear that the power to determine its operations rests with scrutiny committees themselves and that other council committees, including the Executive committee, cannot override their members’ rights. It also makes clear that scrutiny committees can only pass their powers, such as the power to determine scrutiny operations, to scrutiny sub-committees, such as the Scrutiny Programme Board, that comply with the Local Government Act 1972.This means that the Scrutiny Programme Board should be holding its meetings in public. It also means the board should publish its agendas and reports in advance with minimum notice periods and keep proper records of its proceedings, including its decisions, in the form of published minutes. The statutory guidance reinforces these rules: it says decisions about which issues will and will not be subject to scrutiny must be made in public for all to see, and that the Scrutiny Programme Board “should be able to justify how and why a decision has been taken to include certain issues and not others”.The Local Government Act 1972 has been amended and extended by various pieces of legislation since, but nothing substantial has changed since 2011. The government’s statutory guidance on council scrutiny was published a week before Phil Bialyk took over as council leader. Yet the Scrutiny Programme Board did not comply with either when it was created and still does not now.In September last year it published its first annual report, a review of what scrutiny had “achieved” during the preceding year. Like its near-identical and equally flimsy successor, approved at last week’s full council meeting without comment, it includes little more than a list of scrutiny councillors and the scrutiny committee meetings that took place. Each year this report makes its way through no fewer than four council meetings, purposelessly taking up space on their agendas. No other council committee does this, but then no other council committee is trying to hide in plain sight of the law.Local Government Act 2000 section 9FAFor the first eighteen months no minutes were kept of Scrutiny Programme Board meetings, so there are no records at all of its decisions about which topics it did or did not select for scrutiny. Then in April 2021 a pro forma was created for councillors to propose scrutiny topics for selection. The Scrutiny Programme Board began using these forms soon after but records were still not kept and councillors could not see what happened if they submitted one of the forms.Over time it became clear that submitting one might lead to nothing happening at all. In February last year Michael Mitchell suggested the introduction of time limits for the Scrutiny Programme Board to address these submissions. There is no record of the board’s response, but time limits were not introduced. Unsurprisingly, as their scrutiny proposals were being ignored, most councillors gave up submitting them altogether. By this September none of the members of the strategic scrutiny committee meeting had submitted one in more than eighteen months.In October last year Exeter Observer submitted a freedom of information request for all the records the council held concerning Scrutiny Programme Board meetings since its inception. The council took nearly four months to disclose the documents it possessed, four times the maximum response time allowed by law. Five days later the Scrutiny Programme Board decided that notes (not minutes) of its meetings would be posted as council bulletins. While it is possible to find these on the council website it is doubtful that many people know they exist, let alone how to receive notifications that they have been posted.(As the council stopped livestreaming scrutiny committee meetings more than two years ago, it may be that few members of the public even know that the committees themselves exist.)The first bulletin, which outlined what happened at the January 2023 Scrutiny Programme Board meeting, wasn’t published until April. Bizarrely, it says the bulletin would enable members of the public “to be aware of the matters potentially coming to scrutiny.” It also says that Executive committee members can propose issues for scrutiny. It’s not clear whether this demonstrates council defiance or ignorance of the legislation and guidance.23 January 2023 Scrutiny Programme Board notes, posted as council bulletin on 17 AprilThe first bulletin also mentioned the introduction of a scrutiny work plan in March this year, although the Scrutiny Programme Board had been privately using this approach to set the agendas of both scrutiny committees for more than two years by then. Eight such work plans have since been published, four for each scrutiny committee in twin pairs.Of more than 60 individual scrutiny agenda items included in these plans, only three appear as a result of scrutiny councillors submitting pro forma scrutiny proposals. Almost all the rest are routine reports and presentations, most of which should instead be taken to the Executive committee. Of the three issues that appear as a result of scrutiny councillors submitting pro formas only two have actually been heard at a meeting. The other has disappeared.Of the two that have been heard, one was the result of a proposal for a task and finish working group to examine governance and oversight of the St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre capital project. Its aim was to learn from mistakes that were made and understand how the budget more than doubled from £25.5 million to £57 million to avoid repeating them in future.The scrutiny committee that heard this item was presented with an officer report that barely covers four sides of A4. It does not say anything about the multiple budget increases that took place in the first three years of the project. Scrutiny Programme Board member Matt Vizard said he was not convinced that a working group focussed on the St Sidwell’s Point project would serve any useful purpose. Yvonne Atkinson, who became a Scrutiny Programme Board member two months later, said she thought it would be a “total waste of time”.It had already taken nearly two years for this pro forma scrutiny proposal to make it on to a scrutiny committee meeting agenda. When it did, the working group proposals were rejected and the issue was closed.The other pro forma proposal that has been heard at a scrutiny committee meeting was intended to be an examination of the new Exeter Local Plan full draft consultation. The Scrutiny Programme Board scheduled this for last month’s strategic scrutiny committee meeting.The officer report that was presented on the 49,000 word planning policy document that will guide development in Exeter to 2040 was just 850 words long. It is a near word-for-word copy of a report that had already been presented to the Executive committee in October. The consultation had already been open for a month by the time the meeting was held.April 2021 Scrutiny Programme Board proposal pro formaThe Scrutiny Programme Board hasn’t just enabled Executive committee members to direct council scrutiny work while trying to hide in plain sight of the Local Government Act. It has filled scrutiny committee meeting agendas with items that have anything but enabled those committees to hold the council’s decision-makers to account. It is apparently so confident it will continue doing this that it is already planning meetings of both committees that are filled with a mixture of Executive committee business and routine reports until March 2025.Perhaps the councillors who are complicit in all this chicanery are motivated by the political purpose of thwarting the opposition. However Scrutiny Programme Board management of scrutiny work has also enabled senior council officers to direct, defer and divert scrutiny of major issues which need the interrogation that scrutiny is intended to provide. It is not in any councillor’s interests – and is an abnegation of responsibility to the communities they represent – to abet improper officer interference in the democratic process. Without the checks and balances provided by effective scrutiny, democracy doesn’t work.The council’s Strategic Management Board, composed of its most senior officers, sees proposals for scrutiny before councillors on the Scrutiny Programme Board know they have been submitted. The pro forma that was introduced in April 2021 not only said that the form will go to the Strategic Management Board first, but also that the Strategic Management Board will “evaluate any proposal, its timetable and resource implications” before the form is passed on for Scrutiny Programme Board consideration.One proposal from scrutiny councillors to review the council’s public toilets provision was “not supported” by the Strategic Management Board and so rejected. A second, to consider including the Healthy Homes standards promoted by the Town and Country Planning Association in the new Exeter Local Plan was met at first with Strategic Management Board “ifs” and “buts”. When it was eventually scheduled for a scrutiny committee meeting in October this year, more than two years later, the full draft plan had already been signed off by the Executive committee, two days earlier.The item was then postponed for another six weeks, ostensibly so it could be combined with another, related, agenda item. At the subsequent meeting nothing was said about Healthy Homes standards at all and the item has since disappeared from the scrutiny work plan altogether.A third scrutiny proposal, to examine the “governance, accountability and transparency of the council’s increasing use of commercialisation projects delivered via private companies and partnership arrangements” was deferred for “further clarification” as it appeared to be “directed towards scrutiny of Exeter City Living”. It was submitted in July 2021, just before the company really got into trouble, but has never been taken any further.Strategic Management Board member Baan Al-Khafaji openly admitted that it assesses scrutiny proposals against how well they align with the council’s corporate objectives and priorities during a meeting in June this year. This is not the purpose of scrutiny. When a committee member raised the idea of scrutiny examining council decision-making, she said that if scrutiny councillors really wanted to do this they would “have to convince us why you think that’s a priority”.February 2022 Scrutiny Programme Board agenda with chief executive proposals for Exeter Development Fund scrutinyAt one extraordinary Scrutiny Programme Board meeting last year, Karime Hassan, then still council chief executive, attended to put forward his own proposals for scrutiny of Exeter Development Fund, a scheme intended to expose council property assets to private investors that was being promoted by Exeter City Futures, of which he was also CEO at the time. He spelled out who would be invited as witnesses, what they would talk about, the questions that councillors should ask and what the outcome of the scrutiny sessions would be.The Scrutiny Programme Board obliged: the sessions were held as he had proposed. They resembled sales pitches for the scheme, with the chief executive promoting it to councillors but evading questions he didn’t want to answer from scrutiny councillors who had the temerity to go off-script. The conflicts of interest in his participation were ignored. The company continued to insist it would not share key documents with councillors despite already having worked on the scheme for nearly five years.By the fourth session many councillors had realised the scheme was extraordinarily risky, based on insufficiently-evidenced assumptions and wouldn’t meet Exeter’s housing needs. The committee voted to set up a task and finish working group to examine it in more detail, with a particular focus on the governance and risk issues that had been raised but not addressed, before a decision could be taken on commissioning a full business case for the fund. The working group’s first meeting was supposed to be held in September, with no further action to be taken before scrutiny councillors had met to “agree a way forward”.This was in July last year. Corroborating the decision, a corporate risk register update said: “A task and finish group has been established for scrutiny to conclude its consideration of the [Exeter Development Fund] concept”. The same statement was included in the subsequent risk register update. But no task and finish working group meetings were held. In June this year Strategic Management Board member Ian Collinson, who has taken over the development fund mantle from Karime Hassan, told the Scrutiny Programme Board that “further detail was not yet available on the progress of this issue and future meetings” of the working group.Then in September another corporate risk register update said that consultants had already been appointed to produce a full business case for the development fund despite this not having been agreed by councillors. However, when asked which company had been appointed, the council’s response was that it had, in fact, not yet appointed consultants for this purpose. It nevertheless added that Ian Collinson was in the process of doing so.September 2021 Scrutiny Programme Board agenda with Progressive Group climate change scrutiny proposal pro formaThe most egregious instance of city council scrutiny evasion is found, however, in its persistent refusal to permit scrutiny of Exeter’s response to the climate crisis.Scrutiny of citywide decarbonisation had already been suggested by the time of the Scrutiny Programme Board’s second meeting in December 2019. Then as soon as the scrutiny pro formas were introduced in 2021, the Progressive Group of opposition councillors submitted a proposal to scrutinise both council and citywide progress towards achieving net zero. The first Strategic Management Board response was to defer the request for twelve months.Then the following June Karime Hassan presented a report on the issue which disregarded hundreds of thousands of tonnes of Exeter’s annual emissions. It was based on a citywide greenhouse gas inventory performed by an expert university team which had been restricted to territorial emissions instead of including all three emissions scopes. The council refused to say who had decided to commission the inventory this way.In response, the committee voted to set up a permanent sub-committee to “scrutinise the all-encompassing piece of work that will be needed by both the city council and all of our partners” to decarbonise Exeter. Precisely the “watching brief over a critical local issue” that the statutory guidance cites as grounds to establish what it calls a “standing panel” under scrutiny powers.Committee chair Rob Hannaford described the new sub-committee as a “standing overview group” in his proposal to create it, presumably prompted by Devon County Council’s use of this phrase to describe such committees, where he is also a councillor. His proposal was seconded by Conservative councillor Andrew Leadbetter, who also wears a County Hall hat.The decision was confirmed at the following meeting of the full council then sent to the Scrutiny Programme Board for implementation. The board duly added an item to the September scrutiny committee meeting agenda to discuss the sub-committee’s scope and operation.July 2022 Scrutiny Programme Board agenda with chief executive responses to June 2022 climate change sub-committee proposals (and not the June 2022 decision to create a climate change sub-committee)However the Scrutiny Programme Board also considered a report titled: “Comparator information for consideration of a standing overview group proposed by strategic scrutiny committee 16 June”. This tabled Karime Hassan’s response to the decision to create the sub-committee “for the board’s consideration and focus including consideration of timetabling at committee”.He said: “The focus should primarily be on the council’s own greenhouse gas emissions”, adding “there is limited officer capacity to support work, therefore members should focus on areas already identified in the report to Executive on 5 July”. This was a report into which he had inserted several recommendations that had not been mentioned at the preceding scrutiny committee meeting, which it followed, while omitting several that had, including the decision to create the sub-committee.The item to discuss the sub-committee’s scope and operation then disappeared from the September scrutiny committee meeting agenda before it was held. When a councillor queried its absence, committee chair Rob Hannaford said he would instead raise the matter at a forthcoming meeting of the council Governance Review Board, of which he was also chair. A Scrutiny Programme Board meeting held the following month confirmed that the November Governance Review Board meeting would deal with the issue.Three weeks after the November meeting, a corporate risk register update confirmed that a “strategic scrutiny sub-committee for climate change” would be established after the Governance Review Board report was published in January this year.November 2022 Governance Review Board minutes with second decision to create a climate change sub-committeeThe Governance Review Board had its origins in the governance review working group formed by council leader Phil Bialyk in 2019 to reduce scrutiny of council decision-making. It took its proper title in 2021 when the council resolved to establish it permanently to consider amendments to the council’s governance arrangements on an annual basis.Its January 2023 report did not appear. Then the Governance Review Board itself disappeared and its report, recommending the creation of the climate change scrutiny sub-committee, was deferred indefinitely. It was never published.Exeter Observer submitted a freedom of information request for the council’s Governance Review Board records. The council flatly refused to provide them. It said their disclosure would “prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs” without providing either grounds or evidence for this claim.The council then ignored our request for a formal review of its decision, as per the legislation. We complained to the Information Commissioner, who took up our case and stepped in. The council eventually disclosed the documents a week ago, seven months after our request. The Information Commissioner is now considering whether the council simply withheld the documents all this time without good reason.The Governance Review Board met three times last year. It discussed the limits of the council’s current approach to scrutiny, including its decision to scrap the dedicated officer who previously focussed exclusively on this work. It acknowledged that the council’s attitude to scrutiny needed to change, and said the Scrutiny Programme Board’s role in deciding what should, and should not, be scrutinised required unpicking.It also explicitly voted in favour of the scrutiny committee decision to set up a climate change sub-committee, referring to the section of the Local Government Act that provides the committee with the powers to do so. It appears that the council’s motive for refusing to disclose the Governance Review Board records was that it didn’t want anyone to know it had suppressed the board’s decision.January 2023 Governance Review Board report confirming second decision to create a climate change sub-committee (the report was initially deferred to April 2023 before being suppressed)Despite all these machinations the climate change scrutiny sub-committee has refused to die. A Scrutiny Programme Board meeting held in June this year heard that the issue had been raised at a meeting of the council’s political group leaders. It decided that Yvonne Atkinson would “discuss further” the “content and timing of this sub-committee” with the corporate services director, Baan Al-Khafaji, another Strategic Management Board member.At the September strategic scrutiny committee meeting an argument then broke out when Yvonne Atkinson tried to postpone a discussion of the climate change sub-committee terms of reference. After an extended dispute, absurdly turning on whether the vote taken to establish the sub-committee the previous June could stand because Rob Hannaford had described it as a “standing overview group”, the committee voted yet again to establish it, this time in no uncertain terms.At the following full council meeting Yvonne Atkinson then claimed that the minutes recording the decision were inaccurate and sought to change it. The committee vice-chair, who had proposed the vote, said the minutes were correct. The Lord Mayor, presiding, ruled that the minutes should be referred back to the November strategic scrutiny committee meeting to confirm their accuracy.When the November meeting convened the minutes were agreed to be accurate, with the following full council meeting, which took place last week, accepting the decision.September 2023 Strategic scrutiny committee minutes with third decision to create a climate change sub-committeeSo when will the climate change scrutiny sub-committee hold its first meeting? No date is yet set, but on 9 January 2024 the Executive committee will consider a “citywide net zero report detailing a way forward for coordinating and facilitating city wide net zero for Exeter”. It will be published the week before the meeting.Will the council finally uphold the law and allow this sub-committee to meet for the first time more than eighteen months after scrutiny councillors exercised their rights to create it? Will it have all the powers such a sub-committee should have to access confidential information and call councillors, council officers and representatives of external bodies to attend and give evidence?Or will the council find yet another excuse not to do so and instead propose a means of confecting the appearance of addressing citywide decarbonisation, a role for which it employed Exeter City Futures until the company was dissolved this year?And, whether or not Exeter’s response to the climate crisis merits this form of attention, will the council cease its illicit practice of fettering effective scrutiny irrespective of its focus? January’s Executive committee will also consider an “update briefing report on the governance review working group and its current status”. This provides an opportunity for scrutiny governance reform that the council must surely take.

Scrutiny is failing to fulfil its purpose and the Scrutiny Programme Board is enabling this failure. Council governance changes are urgently needed to prevent Executive committee and senior officer interference in the work of scrutiny, and to comply with the Local Government Act by holding Scrutiny Programme Board meetings in public, publishing their agendas and reports in advance and keeping proper records of their proceedings, including their decisions, in the form of published minutes.The management of scrutiny committee meeting agendas would then take place transparently, as the law requires, with decisions about which issues will, and will not, be subject to scrutiny made with clear justification for all to see.Council governance changes are also needed to reflect the fact that scrutiny councillors are entitled to create sub-committees to conduct investigations using a variety of working practices without requiring the full council to approve them. And that Executive committee members are not, whether with worthwhile purpose or otherwise.Then, and only then, will Exeter City Council scrutiny be able to hold its decision-makers to account and properly perform the role that makes it “fundamentally important to the successful functioning of local democracy”."

"content" : "A new application to build a student accommodation block in the back garden of a thirteen bedroom Union Road student House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) has been submitted to Exeter City Council.It follows refusal of an earlier application for the same site, upheld by a planning inspector in October.The new proposal, submitted earlier this month, is for a single storey 136 square metre block with six bedrooms and a separate living, kitchen and dining area.The original proposal was for a two storey, ten bedroom block with the same footprint. It received 61 public objections without a single supportive response.It was refused by council planning officers in December last year on grounds including its scale and intensity, the impact it would have on neighbours and its incompatibility with the St James Neighbourhood Plan.3D view of original development proposal. Image: Ercle.The applicant appealed the refusal in May this year, before separately applying to build a six bedroom two storey student accommodation block in the back garden of another student HMO he also owns in Pennsylvania Road.In the October decision dismissing the appeal, the planning inspector said the development would be “uncharacteristically prominent, bulky and of a density and massing that would be incompatible with the immediate and surrounding townscape setting”.The Pennsylvania Road application prompted 26 public objections. It was refused by planning officers last month.

At a typical rent of £500pcm per bedroom, the annual income from these houses would be around £550,000 each year.It is not known whether the applicant also owns unlicensed HMOs in the city, or how many if so.Unlicensed HMOs make up the bulk of residential housing that is being used for student accommodation in Exeter, but the city council does not know how many there are or where they are all located."

"content" : "Junior doctors at the Royal Devon NHS Trust are taking industrial action either side of Christmas for a total of nine days alongside colleagues across the country in what will be the longest strike in NHS history.They are on strike for three days from 7am today and will also strike for six days from 3 January.British Medical Association (BMA) members will be joined by colleagues from the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) in this week’s industrial action. HCSA members are voting on whether to join the January strikes in a ballot that closes today.The walkouts are part of an ongoing national dispute between the government and health service unions about pay and employment conditions.Royal Devon and Exeter hospital at WonfordHCSA president Dr Naru Narayanan said: “Junior doctors will again walk out this winter in what has become a marathon dispute which nobody wants.”He added: “The government’s dogged refusal to acknowledge the impact of long-term pay decline is at the root of these strikes. We need a resolution which answers the central issue here – the impact of years of real-terms salary cuts on recruitment, morale and retention.”The BMA announced today’s strike action in early December after pay negotiations with the government failed to produce agreement.BMA junior doctors committee co-chairs Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi said: “After five weeks of intense talks, the government was unable to present a credible offer on pay by the deadline.“It is clear it is still not prepared to address the real-terms pay cut doctors have experienced since 2008.”They added: “We will be ready and willing any time the Government wants to talk. If a credible offer can be presented the day before, or even during any action, these strikes can be cancelled.”Striking nurses at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in December 2022A series of strikes over pay and conditions have been held by NHS staff including nurses, consultants, junior doctors, radiographers and ambulance workers over the past 18 months.They followed a government pay offer last year which trade unions said amounted to a real-terms pay cut, particularly in the context of the cost of living crisis.The BMA began its campaign for increased pay in June last year after a vote at its annual conference.Doctors said that years of pay freezes and 1% annual salary uplifts meant that the value of their take-home pay had fallen by almost a third since 2008.The BMA is seeking a pay rise of up to 35% over the next five years to restore pay to 2008 levels.Royal Devon and Exeter hospital at HeavitreeJunior doctors – hospital doctors who are not consultants – make up almost half of all doctors in hospitals in England.They voted on industrial action in January this year, resulting in a three day strike in March. The ballot returned a 98% vote in favour of industrial action on a turnout of 77.5%.A series of strikes then followed, over four days in April, three days in June, five days in July – at that stage the longest NHS strike in its history – and four days in early August.In late August, consultants held a two day strike during a four day strike by junior doctors, the first time they had taken strike action simultaneously.Consultants and junior doctors were then joined by radiologists for a three day strike in early October.

"content" : "Peninsula Transport has published a regional mobility infrastructure strategy that will guide transport investment decisions across the South West until 2050.The strategy, which will be used to identify and prioritise long-term regional transport scheme investment, has been published in draft form for a public consultation that is open to 5 February.Peninsula Transport is a consortium formed in 2018 by the five regional transport authorities and advised by representatives of transport operators as well as business, passenger and road user groups.It is inviting comments on the draft strategy from residents, businesses and visitors to the region.One of seven UK sub-national transport bodies, Peninsula Transport is funded by the Department for Transport and contributions from each of its local authority members: Cornwall Council, Devon County Council, Torbay Council, Plymouth Council and Somerset County Council.It works directly with the Department for Transport on strategic transport priorities across the peninsula and includes co-opted members from Highways England and Network Rail.Publication of the Peninsula Transport draft strategy is the latest stage in the development of an overall strategic framework aimed at directing transport investment across the region to 2050.It follows an initial regional study and subsequent vision document which was used a basis to produce a series of high-level goals following a public consultation held in 2021.The draft strategy identifies key objectives for 2030 including bus and rail network integration, the creation of an electric vehicle charging network and increased travel connections across the region resulting in a “fully integrated, resilient, safe, reliable transport network” in which “walking, wheeling and public transport are the preferred choice for most journeys”.It is informed by an extensive Department for Transport-funded evidence base which identifies key challenges and opportunities for the region across different aspects of transport policy.Peninsula Transport Strategy context diagramA 2021 strategic economic corridor study, built on analysis from a 2020 economic connectivity report, found that only 15% of 18 million annual visitors to the South West use public transport.The region’s 500km strategic road network, of which more than a quarter is single carriageway, sees a 70% increase in traffic during the summer.A 2022 freight study found that only 5% of the 70 million tonnes of freight that travel through the peninsula each year is moved by rail, and a subsequent rail study found that the region’s network is on average 20mph slower than elsewhere in the UK, with mostly single-track branch lines.Only 30% of the region’s population lives within walking or cycling distance of a rail station.South West rail station accessibilityA 2022 rural mobility report highlighted the challenges presented by half of the region’s population living in rural areas. The South West has the least accessible public transport network in the country, with 60% fewer bus stops in rural than urban areas.The region has the second highest level of car ownership in the UK and the majority of travel to work journeys are made by car. It also has the highest private transport mileage per person.A 2023 carbon transition study found that 44% of the region’s terrestrial greenhouse gas emissions are generated by transport – nearly 4.5 million tCO2e.And a technology study that was also published this year found that there are currently only 1,200 public electric vehicle charging points in the South West for approximately 34,000 electric vehicles, with demand expected to increase twenty times over in the next twelve years.South West international and strategic gatewaysThe evidence base also includes an international gateways report focussed on the region’s airports and ports and identifies ways economic activity could be increased through these sites.It recommends improving communication between the manufacturing and tourism industries to “promote services”.Peninsula Transport says the strategy has been developed “with a view to reducing environmental impact” and its board says it is working towards net zero by 2050.The region’s local authorities have all declared climate emergencies.

Image: Wring Group.The council has struggled to find a demolition contractor for the Bampfylde Street building, which has not been in use since June 2018.Its closure was put back by several months because of delays in the appointment of a contractor for the construction of the new, adjacent bus station.Temporary bus and coach stops were positioned nearby, including on Sidwell Street and Cheeke Street, for more than three years until the new station opened in July 2021.2018 CityPoint development scheme drawingThe old bus and coach station is located on part of what is known as the CityPoint redevelopment site, which includes the buildings on Paris Street and Sidwell Street as far as Cheeke Street.The site is part of the East Gate development zone allocated in the new Exeter Local Plan.CityPoint was a response to the failure of previous plans dating back to 2015 for an extension of the Princesshay shopping centre across Paris Street.It was to include a hotel, retail and food outlets, offices, build to rent housing and a new civic centre to enable the council to relocate and redevelop its current offices across the road.The council proceeded with St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre and the new bus station at a total cost of £57 million but the rest of the site has remained undeveloped. Its future remains uncertain."

"content" : "Developer Zinc Real Estate is seeking feedback on its proposals to create “a dynamic silhouette for the city skyline” by demolishing Clarendon House in Western Way and replacing it with a 350-bed student accommodation block up to sixteen storeys tall.Clarendon House is a five-storey 1960s office block that stands on the Paris Street roundabout at the corner of Western Way and Heavitree Road.It is beside the Leonardo Hotel (formerly Jury’s Inn) and faces St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre across the roundabout. It is currently part-occupied by Exeter Jobcentre Plus.Clarendon House student accommodation proposals illustrative view (front). Source: Zinc Real Estate.Zinc Real Estate, which is based in London and The Netherlands, says it wants to “create a landmark building, as well as deliver significant improvements to connectivity and public realm” in the area.Its proposed design includes a “garden lane” walkway between the block and the Leonardo Hotel, providing access to the Triangle car park behind, and new pedestrian crossings across Western Way and Cheeke Street, where high levels of traffic make current pedestrian use unsafe.Russell Street, beside the Grade II-listed building occupied by Exeter Sewing Machine Company, would also be widened where it joins Heavitree Road.The proposed development includes an internal garden courtyard and a “community start-up space” which would be reached through a shop front on Heavitree Road.The developer is seeking “community and partners to explore possible uses” for this space, which it describes as “large and lofty”, such as “co-working and spaces for small business start-ups to grow”.Clarendon House student accommodation proposals illustrative view (rear). Source: Zinc Real Estate.Clarendon House is located in the East Gate development zone allocated in the new Exeter Local Plan.The developer says its proposals would be in “synergy with St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre” and that the leisure centre and the new bus station show that the area has “further potential for redevelopment”.It claims an “aspiration” to construct a “net zero carbon building”, citing Liveable Exeter principles.It also says the city centre location makes Clarendon House an ideal site for Purpose Built Student Accommodation, and that proximity to the roundabout renders it unsuitable for other types of residential accommodation.The proposed block would be a short distance from several existing city centre student accommodation blocks in Paris Street, Cheeke Street and Bampfylde Street.

"content" : "Council leader Phil Bialyk last week sought to change course at Mary Arches Street car park and the Clifton Hill sports centre site by rejecting the council finance director’s proposal to get best value for the public purse by selling both for student accommodation.Both assets are first in the fire sale queue following the failure of Exeter City Living, the council’s subsidiary property development company, which has left the council needing to raise around £9 million to cover the company’s outstanding debt.Selling either asset for redevelopment as student accommodation would be a political calamity for the council leader, especially the Clifton Hill site given its torrid history.So instead of reversing the council’s policy of not selling land for student accommodation, he amended the sale proposals, apparently determined to demonstrate that he and his Executive committee colleagues would stand by the residents of St David’s and Newtown no matter the cost.Clifton Hill sports centre development siteConfidential valuations for the site sale options the council had considered were attached to the end of the Executive committee agenda, when public and press were to be excluded from the meeting, but the council leader moved the decision up the agenda to please the public gallery.The valuations remained under wraps, so the committee voted in favour of the revised sale proposals without first discussing their financial consequences, although local ward councillor Matt Vizard did admit, speaking from the floor, that the council would be “turning down millions in potential receipts” by ruling out student accommodation use.The revised proposals are to sell the Mary Arches Street car park land identified in the appendix one boundary map with “the multi-storey car park site for co-living use, and the surface car park for residential use”, and to sell the Clifton Hill land identified in the appendix two boundary map for use as residential homes while “retaining the green shaded area for existing use as an open space”.Presumably-proposed Mary Arches Street car park development site sale appendix four boundary mapAs the appendix one boundary map does not include the surface car park, we assume the council leader intended to refer to the appendix four boundary map, which does. His amendments also mentioned yellow and purple shaded areas on the Clifton Hill map, but as these appear only on the appendix three map we assume these references are redundant.It’s also not clear whether “retaining” the Clifton Hill green space for “existing use as an open space” means it will be excluded from the sale or included in it with a covenant to require the site’s new owner to retain its use as such even though it will no longer be publicly-owned.The revised proposals will now go to Tuesday’s meeting of the full council, where these issues will presumably be clarified before the proposals are approved. The £800,000 budget to enable the sales remains unchanged.Council officers would then be tasked with working out how to deliver the newly-restricted sales before reporting back to the Executive committee at an unspecified future date. Further ratification at a meeting of the full council would then be required before any land is sold.Proposed Clifton Hill development site sale appendix two boundary mapSelling both sites for student accommodation use would have fetched the best price, although doing so was not guaranteed to raise the required £9 million, as the council finance director’s report made clear.Student accommodation is the most lucrative development form in Exeter for three key reasons. The very high residential densities its tiny, temporary living spaces allow, the insatiable demand created by the university’s inexorable expansion, particularly from an increasing number of overseas students, and the rents its students pay, which are among the highest in the country.Nevertheless, student accommodation developers face the same underlying issues as the rest of the construction sector, including materials and labour shortages, as well as currently high financing costs.Now is not a good time to be selling any large development site, especially if it presents additional brownfield challenges. Another recent report said that none of the council’s brownfield housing development sites are currently viable and “will remain so without significant government interventions”.Several student block sites are stalled in Exeter despite having full planning consent, or are being dragged out by their developers. The sixth planning application for the same scheme in more than six years is currently being considered for the site of the former King Billy public house at the top of Longbrook Street.According to a report submitted as evidence in the Heavitree Road police station site planning appeal, more than 2,000 student accommodation bedspaces have planning consent in the city of which only 110 are being built.Heavitree Road police station site proposals illustrative elevationNevertheless, the council finance director’s report says, selling sites that are particularly suitable for student accommodation for any other use “could mean foregoing something in the region of 70% of the site’s potential value”.Would selling for co-living development at Mary Arches Street multi-storey car park really mean losing 70% of the site’s value? Surely co-living blocks are simply purpose built student accommodation by another name?The council’s political leadership wants us to think not: its policy not to sell council land for student accommodation wouldn’t stand up otherwise. Nor do council officers treat the two uses the same way, although for different reasons.The new Community Infrastructure Levy, a charge the council imposes on most new development in Exeter towards the cost of infrastructure that is needed to mitigate its impact, gives co-living blocks a big discount on the grounds it is an untested form of development here.Co-living developers are to pay one third of the charge levied on student accommodation development to reflect challenges that the council says make co-living much less viable to build.Haven Banks revised scheme illustrative viewThe distinction the levy makes between the two uses isn’t quite as artificial as first appears, but not because the design form of co-living blocks has “specific characteristics and acknowledged differences to others types of development”, the justification given for the discount.The design form of most new student accommodation blocks is essentially indistinguishable from co-living as studio rooms have replaced the cluster flats that used to characterise student halls.Instead, a consultation response to the huge hybrid Haven Banks redevelopment scheme that was approved at Tuesday’s council planning committee meeting, in which 43% of 423 units are co-living studios, points to a much more significant difference between the two: their business models.The Devon and Cornwall Police Designing Out Crime Officer said: “Given the nature of co-living developments it seems likely that the resident population could be somewhat transient with potentially a high turnover of individuals. This can make creating a feeling of community somewhat challenging.“Shared amenity space is a key element of the co-living model, so detailing ways in which a sense of community and ownership can be created needs to be considered and demonstrated.“If such a sense is not created, it leaves the development vulnerable as residents don’t identify with communal space and become disassociated from them leading to an increase in crime and anti-social behaviour.”The Gorge being rushed towards completion in SeptemberPurpose built student accommodation is restricted to students, but no such homogeneity is proposed for co-living blocks, where essentially anyone can rent rooms provided they can pay.It nevertheless appears that Exeter co-living developers intend to rent to students: all the city’s proposed and consented schemes, except Haven Banks, are very close to one or the other of the university’s two Exeter campuses as well as existing student accommodation blocks.Only one co-living development has so far been built in Exeter, The Gorge. It sits largely empty several months after completion, apparently because it didn’t open in time for the beginning of term at St Luke’s campus on the other side of the road.If this block is anything to go by, where rents are so high that most local people do not earn enough to become tenants, the number of people in Exeter who could both afford to rent a co-living studio and who might also want to do so is very small. Unless you include students with wealthy parents.But what if Exeter’s co-living blocks do not fill with students?The business model risk these developers face is that purpose built student accommodation blocks are, in effect, gated communities that offer relative security to tenants who are all here to attend the university and all arrive at the beginning of the academic year and leave at the end.The sense of community that is baked in to these blocks, where everyone is more or less on the same page, is not replicated in co-living, where anyone at all might be renting on the same corridor and using communal areas, and faces can change from week to week.Harlequins revised scheme illustrative elevationThere has never been any evidence presented that demonstrates demand for co-living in Exeter, as distinct from demand for accommodation driven by the city’s huge student population.Harlequins, on the other side of the road from the Mary Arches Street multi-storey car park, was the first co-living development to gain planning consent here.Are construction sector challenges the reason work has not begun more than three years after planning permission was granted, or are its developers holding back because of the risk that, were students not to fill the blocks, there would be too few non-student tenants to turn a profit?The scheme’s developers succeeded in revising its planning consent in November 2021, effectively extending the deadline to begin work until this time next year. When asked, they would not say when works might start.Three other proposed co-living schemes are pending consideration by planning officers. Exeland House, between two large city centre student blocks, Victoria Street, in the heart of student HMO-saturated St James and Summerland Street, opposite The Depot.All have yet to come before the council planning committee for a decision and none will be built anytime soon, even if they do gain planning consent.The Heavitree Road police station site scheme is another huge hybrid, half co-living, half student accommodation. The council refused it this time last year, and the appeal against the refusal begins next week. If the scheme is allowed, by no means a racing certainty, completion would be at least two years away, probably more.With The Gorge largely empty and the Haven Banks developers saying only that they aim to start work at the end of next year, the co-living business model remains unproven in Exeter and will stay that way for a long time to come.Mary Arches Street multi storey car parkSelling Mary Arches Street multi-storey car park for student accommodation would not only have fetched the highest price, it would have side-stepped the business model risks co-living presents to Exeter developers.And this isn’t the only problem, on top of construction sector and financing challenges, that developers considering a punt there face. There are two others that are not considerations at any of Exeter’s other co-living or hybrid scheme development sites.One is the challenge presented in demolishing such a large reinforced concrete structure. The heavy machinery that is required is not readily available in the South West, which is partly why the old bus station beside St Sidwell’s Point still stands more than two years after its replacement was opened.The council received a £1,310,000 government Brownfield Land Release Fund grant towards demolishing the multi-storey car park two years ago but hasn’t been able to act. If works don’t begin by the end of March the money becomes repayable unless the government agrees to extend the deadline.Mary Arches Street surface car parkThe other issue, now the council leader’s site sale proposals include the surface car park as well, is that archaeological digs for Roman remains will also be required.Would a private sector developer take on the risk of important finds emerging from beneath the tarmac or will the council have to excavate as well as demolish before putting the site up for sale?Even with half the site reduced to rubble and the other half dug up, a prospective buyer would still have to be convinced that both halves could be brought forward profitably for the restricted uses that the revised sale proposals prescribe.As construction sector challenges, high financing costs and co-living business model risks will all be in place for some time to come, it is difficult to imagine a developer offering to pay more than rock bottom for the Mary Arches site anytime soon.Clifton Hill redevelopment illustrative elevationAnd what about the Clifton Hill sports centre site? Its viability for residential redevelopment is clearly also in doubt: the council has already tried to bring it forward this way three times.Residential use was the basis of the sale proposed in 2018, then Exeter City Living failed to find a delivery contractor on the same basis, with planning consent, in 2022 and again last year.The council intends, at least to begin with, to try to find a developer willing to buy the site with its existing consent for “high quality, exemplar homes designed to the highest standards of sustainable, low carbon design”.This consent not only no longer includes any affordable housing but also means the resulting high-specification town houses would be very expensive to buy, as reflected in Exeter City Living’s marketing, which was not aimed at local residents.A September 2021 viability assessment commissioned by the company said that the planned Clifton Hill houses, which range from 121 to 225 square metres in size, would sell for £3,588.87 per square metre.The 16% increase in Exeter sale prices since then would mean the smallest would cost £500,000 and the largest £940,000 if they were marketed today.And the council can only sell the site with the existing consent if it wants to keep its price negotiation cards close to its chest. As the local planning authority it cannot take a decision in private if it relates to proposed development for which it may grant itself planning permission.As at Mary Arches, it appears that any developer willing to buy the Clifton Hill site with its use restricted to residential housing would be in a position to drive a very hard bargain indeed.Clifton Hill redevelopment illustrative interiorAs the council finance director says, the only way to find out what the two sites are really worth is to take them to market. And then to complete the sales.Let’s assume council officers address the viability issues at Mary Arches Street and eventually find buyers for both sites with their uses restricted by covenant, albeit at knock-down prices.It’s a pretty safe bet that the council will need the Secretary of State’s permission to sell each for several million pounds less than the best prices they would otherwise fetch, as happened when the council sold Clifton Hill sports centre to Exeter City Living nearly four years ago.Let’s assume this permission is forthcoming. After all, the government won’t be concerned that the houses at Clifton Hill will be high-spec homes for the wealthy, or that the co-living studios at Mary Arches Street car park will be tiny, expensive bedsits for the transient, whether students or not.It will be content to see publicly-owned assets sold cheap to private developers, and it won’t be the government’s problem that the council won’t raise anywhere near the £9 million it needs to cover Exeter City Living’s debt from the sales.Exeter canal basin development siteBut this outcome will be the council’s problem. It will mean the sale of more council assets, with the site at the head of Exeter ship canal currently occupied by the Ride On cycling charity, Exe Water Sports Association and an adjacent boatyard apparently next in line.The is one of several sites that were also in the Exeter City Living development pipeline, with significant feasibility work already complete, at the point the council decided to all-but wind up the company.Bonhay Meadows, the Cathedral &amp;amp; Quay car park and Belle Isle depot have all been ruled out, and the council can’t sell the Glasshouse Lane site as it doesn’t own it.The policies in the council’s draft Water Lane area planning document that refer to the canal basin site make no mention of non-residential ground floor uses, and the accompanying illustration shows only blocks of flats.Exe Water Sports Association and Ride On Cycling are mentioned only once each in the 154-page document, and both only in passing. Their fate, along with the site, looks like it is already sealed.Water Lane SPD canal basin zone illustration. Source: Exeter City Council.At the end of last week’s Executive meeting the committee also voted to add £3.8 million to the council’s already undeliverable £42 million capital programme, of which £22 million is unfunded, by increasing the Exton Road recycling depot upgrade budget to £8 million.This budget is “subject to the identification of sufficient capital receipts to finance the whole project”, meaning another £8 million in asset sales on top of the £9 million it already needs to raise this way.The council also has to find another £5.1 million in cuts to its revenue budget to balance the books over the next four years, on top of the £3 million it has already cut from its 2023-24 budget.So the question that’s left hanging is: which other assets will the council now have to sell, first to cover Exeter City Living’s debts then to pay for its other capital shortfalls?

The council leader has made probably the most prudent political move he can in the circumstances, short of reversing the council’s policy of not selling its land for student accommodation to get the best price for as few of the council’s assets as possible.Doing that would instead be the most prudent financial move.No doubt many residents will think that his change of course has saved the day for “the people of Exeter”, a paraphrase of the prime minster that he keeps repeating, helped to that conclusion by headlines in other, less scrupulous local news publications.And postponing the final Mary Arches Street and Clifton Hill site sale decisions until a report comes back to the Executive next year may well mean that little more is said in public about either until after the May local elections.In the meantime Exeter City Living debt related to the Clifton Hill site alone is costing the council £80,000 a year to service, and the list of assets the council needs to sell is getting longer.Whatever is eventually built on land the council sells to cover its Exeter City Living debt, it should not obscure the colossal and entirely avoidable waste of public money that has led the council to such a pass."

"content" : "The developers of a student accommodation block on a site at the top of Longbrook Street are proposing major changes to its design that would upend key provisions from the consented scheme that formed the basis of its approval.The site was previously occupied by the King Billy public house, which closed in 2018 before being demolished earlier this year, and Shepherd’s Garage, which was demolished in 2007.The application to the city council to make the changes, which are framed as minor alterations, is the sixth time planning consent has been sought in relation to the scheme over the course of more than six years.Documents accompanying the current proposals also reveal the unauthorised demolition of a protected 14th century structure on the site near Exeter’s ancient city walls.Longbrook Street student accommodation development site before demolitionPlanning permission for the development was originally approved in October 2017.The consented nine-storey scheme includes two large ground floor commercial units, seven floors of student accommodation in cluster flats and a student lounge and roof terrace occupying a smaller area set back on the top floor.The ground floor commercial units – a 97m2 retail space and an 83m2 restaurant/bar space with mezzanine – and the top floor communal areas were arranged this way following Design Review Panel interventions.The commercial units were intended to provide active frontage that was integrated into the existing city centre street scene while the double-height windows for the two storey restaurant/bar were a key architectural feature intended to step upwards towards the much taller John Lewis building next door.They were intended to maximise ground floor commercial use and were integral to the building’s design.October 2017 consented scheme elevationConsiderable emphasis was placed on the importance of this layout both in the application documents and at the city council planning committee meetings that discussed it.All three versions of the application design and access statement mention the value of the commercial street frontage repeatedly, saying that it would be “maintained in any proposal”. The planning case officer’s report says it would support the “vitality and viability of the area”.The committee minutes confirm both that councillors considered it “very important” and that the developer was required to include it in the scheme.The council’s development manager also said that “any application to change the use of the ground floor away from retail/commercial would come back to this committee”.A section 106 agreement binding the developer to all the planning consent conditions was duly signed the following April.October 2017 consented scheme floor plansWork did not begin. In December 2020 the developers applied to renew the consent, citing “contractual reasons” as the cause of the delay.The renewal was approved by council officers in June 2021.Another year passed. The developers then applied to revise the scheme by reconfiguring the seven floors of student accommodation, reducing the total number of bedspaces from 108 to 97.Apart from two newly-introduced studio flats, all the remaining bedspaces were still arranged as cluster flats, another key feature of the original design.This was intended to facilitate the conversion of each flat into residential accommodation meeting national minimum space standards so the block might one day be used to house local people instead of students.The revised scheme left the ground floor commercial units and top floor communal student spaces unchanged.Council officers granted permission for the revisions, as non-material amendments that did not breach any of the agreed planning consent conditions, in May last year.April 2022 revised scheme floor plansThe developers then proposed more amendments to the scheme in January this year, seeking to replace several cluster flats with 28 more studios while retaining the future-proofing potential for conversion to residential accommodation.This time the ground floor commercial units were changed: a bin store was inserted into the street frontage at one end of the building and the two-storey restaurant/bar became a cafe. The top floor roof terrace vanished.Council officers again granted permission for the revisions as non-material amendments to the consented scheme. They took just three days to issue their decision, based on a 200-word report.January 2023 amended scheme floor planIn October the developers submitted two more applications to change the scheme. One seeks to replace the remaining thirteen student cluster flats so the whole block would become studios.To create the extra internal space needed for so many studios the developers want to significantly enlarge the sixth, seventh and top floors of the building.They also want to move the communal lounge to the ground floor, replacing the retail unit, and to cut the two storey restaurant/bar unit down to a single storey to use the space above for accommodation, halving its windows so the visual step up to John Lewis next door is lost.And they want to move the bike store from the back of the building to the front, creating space for the plant room that has made way for studio rooms on the top floor.Their justification for these changes is that studios are “better suited to a wider and more diverse range of cultural and social needs for both international and domestic students” including “considerations such as ethnicity, religion, gender and food preparation habits”.They also cite previously unidentified “potential” safety and security “concerns”, including unspecified danger in the John Lewis car park.October 2023 scheme variation floor plansThe effect of these changes would be to remove 180m2 of commercial space from the consented design and add around 330m2 of student accommodation, upending the building layout and removing the active street frontage that was essential to the scheme’s initial approval.The developers claim that the building’s street-level frontage would nevertheless remain “active and engaging”.They also say the removal of the mezzanine floor from the unit that started as a two storey restaurant/bar and has become a single storey cafe “will not adversely affect its functionality or rental potential”.The changes would also subvert the building layout intended to enable potential future conversion into residential accommodation.At the same time as applying to make these changes, the developers submitted a second application to alter the description of the scheme in line with their new proposals.The council took just three days to approve the alteration as non-material despite the implication that doing so accepted the use of all nine floors of the building for student accommodation.October 2023 scheme variation elevationAnother significant change was also included in both October applications, but not in the sense the developers have applied for permission to make it.The applications are accompanied by floor plans and elevations that show that a large boundary wall on the site which dated back to the 14th Century and was only a stone’s throw from the city’s ancient East Gate has been demolished.The disappearance is clearly visible by comparing plans submitted by new architects appointed to produce the January drawings with post-demolition revisions they subsequently made to those drawings in support of the October applications.An image of a large white box van has even been inserted into an illustrative 3D view directly in front of where the wall should be, hiding its disappearance, although the short section that is still visible beside it has also been pulled down.Longbrook Street student accommodation development site – the lower four floors of the Vita Student building should not be visible in this viewThe medieval wall was the subject of considerable attention in the original planning application.All three versions of the accompanying design and access statement say it would be “dealt with sensitively” with the building’s design “highlighting its importance” and would be repaired “where insensitive alterations have already taken place”.A planning and economic statement said the development would “secure the long-term protection” of the historic wall, bringing “public benefits”, and a heritage statement confirmed that the wall, of which it includes several photos, was an important heritage asset which would be retained.Accordingly, a planning condition was included in the consent that was granted.It said that “identification, recording and publication of archaeological and historic remains affected by the development” was required “to ensure that historic remains are not damaged during the construction process”.Comments on the current proposals to amend the Longbrook Street student accommodation scheme can be submitted via the city council website until Sunday 10 December.The council planning committee is expected to hear the application at a later date."

"content" : "Exeter homelessness charity St Petrock’s has launched its Christmas 2023 fundraising appeal with a short film exploring how it feels to be homeless.The two-minute video, produced by Devon film-makers All Told, features four local people who are rebuilding their lives following homelessness.Each credits St Petrock’s with helping them get them back on their feet.Alfie, who appears in the film, grew up in the care system and lived on the streets for eight years. He says Christmas was particularly hard: “Watching people walking by with their children, I felt invisible and lonely”.St Petrock’s supported Alfie and helped him into secure accommodation where he now lives with his fiancée, Naomi.He adds: “I was just a lonely man in a lonely doorway. Then Petrock’s came along and and lifted me up”.The number of people sleeping rough in Exeter remains at a critically high level after doubling last year.On a typical night, between 25 and 35 people sleep rough on the streets of Exeter. They are not a static group: people find themselves newly-homeless every week.Many others are homeless but not living on the streets.There are many causes of homelessness, although it often has roots in childhood trauma or later events such as the breakdown of relationships.The loss of homelessness prevention services and the cost of living and housing crises have made the situation worse.St Petrock’s director Peter Stephenson says: “Sadly, we’re all too familiar with seeing people living on our streets and of course there are many others, hidden from view, sleeping in garages or sheds, on sofas or in cars.“All of them have had things happen in their lives that most of us thankfully will never experience, and it is that traumatic experience that lies at the root of rough sleeping.“Sleeping rough, people face extreme physical and mental hardship, as well as the constant danger of abuse and assault.“It is incomprehensible that some still try to portray rough sleeping as if it were a lifestyle choice. No one chooses to be homeless.”St Petrock’s began providing homelessness support in December 1994. Its team, supported by 30 volunteers, helps people to access housing, healthcare, benefits and other essential services.From its centre in Cathedral Yard it provides hot showers, laundry facilities, phone and internet access and supplies survival equipment and clothing.It also prepares and serves breakfast and lunch to rough sleepers across the city each weekday. It will provide a full Christmas lunch to all its clients on 25 December, with gifts.The charity also provides accommodation for people without a home and is actively pursuing the purchase of more properties for this purpose.Almost all its funding comes from the local community.St Petrock’s Christmas appeal aims to raise funds to support its work at what it is a difficult time of year for rough sleepers.The festivities many take for granted can make the experience of extreme poverty suffered by those without a home more severe.They often also bring back difficult memories of past Christmases, of loss or trauma fuelled by festive excess, at a time when social isolation and loneliness can feel acute.This year the demand for St Petrock’s support is higher than it has ever been.

Around £2 billion a year of capital investment is required alongside additional operating expenditure of around £7.5 billion per year to enable more than 47 billion annual car driver and passenger kilometres to shift to public transport by 2030.The other is the reversal of 1980s bus services deregulation, giving all local transport authorities the powers to franchise bus services and manage them as a public service."

It planned to build 31 luxury townhouses for private market sale alongside eleven “affordable” flats there, but twice failed to find a development delivery contractor.It also intended to build around 100 flats for private market rent on the site of Mary Arches Street car park after buying it from the council, but the sale has not taken place.

(£1.3 million more than Mid Devon District Council is expecting to write off in relation to its failed development company.)It then proposes to sell the Clifton Hill site, as well as its adjacent green space, and the Mary Arches Street multi-storey car park, but not its adjacent surface car park, to cover as much of the outstanding £9 million as possible.However the council will have to sell both sites with planning permission for high-yield redevelopment schemes for it to raise the £9 million it needs.

Hence the old bus station beside St Sidwell’s Point is still standing more than two years after its replacement was opened.)And the viability assessment Exeter City Living commissioned to justify the removal of the affordable housing requirement it initially agreed at Clifton Hill also found that this site would be worth most for redevelopment as student accommodation.The report suggests this unrestricted sale option might allow the council to raise not only the £9 million it needs but more besides, which it could use for other capital projects while avoiding the risk of having to sell any more land or assets to cover the outstanding Exeter City Living debt.Proposed Clifton Hill development site sale boundaryThe council report also proposes the creation of an £800,000 budget to pay for the costs involved in selling the sites.Among other things, these are expected to include the cost of the council using its compulsory purchase powers to ensure vacant possession of property in North Street that would be included in the Mary Arches Street multi-storey car park sale.The city council Executive committee will decide whether to agree the proposals at its meeting on Tuesday.A meeting of the full council follows on 12 December at which the Executive decision is expected to be approved."

"content" : "Exeter City Council has granted Exeter Chiefs rugby club planning permission to hold six concerts at Sandy Park stadium on Saturday and Sunday evenings between 1 May and 15 July each year.Up to 15,500 attendees, including event workers, will be permitted at each concert, at which loud amplified music will be allowed from 4pm to 10.30pm.The planning consent, which was granted at Monday’s council planning committee meeting, is for a permanent variation to a planning restriction which previously precluded Sandy Park stadium’s use as a music or performance venue.The restriction was imposed when the club was given permission to double the stadium’s capacity eleven years ago.The club’s application to alter the restriction relied on noise and transport impact surveys performed at four trial concerts held at the stadium in June despite none of the events being attended by more than 3,550 people.The club was so confident that the council would allow the trial concerts that it began selling tickets two months before they were approved.A council licensing committee had already granted another variation to allow the stadium’s use as a venue for boxing, wrestling, theatre, film and music events at the end of January.Sandy Park stadium. Image: Exeter City Council.When the council gave the club permission to hold the trial concerts at the end of May, its planning committee heard accounts of extreme anti-social behaviour by visitors attending events at the stadium as well as other adverse impacts on local residents including noise, litter and traffic.At Monday’s meeting public speaker Kevin Cook said the trial concerts, which prompted seventeen complaints, had led to similar noise, traffic and parking problems as well as drunken anti-social behaviour from event attendees.However he added that many residents were now resigned to the club receiving planning consent for the events, describing the decision as a “fait accompli”.He said many felt like “collateral damage”, adding that he was “horrified” that the consent would be permanent.Mark Isaacs, speaking for Exeter Rugby Club, said that the trial events had been a success, with “very little impact on the surrounding environment”.He said that the club had brought millions of pounds into the city, along with what he described as a “much-needed four star hotel”, saying it had generated “vital income to assist with the current cost of living crisis”.

When local ward councillor Anne Jobson suggested a 9.30pm Sunday concert noise curfew would be preferable to enable children living nearby to sleep, Mark Isaacs said the club had experimented with a 9.30pm finish but he had “felt” that the concerts could have continued later into the evening.The meeting also heard that National Highways had requested that the main act at each concert would not begin before 9pm, with support acts on stage from 4pm onwards, to stagger the impact of event-generated traffic on nearby junction 30 of the M5.Council development director Ian Collinson said that all the issues had been rigorously examined by independent experts who had found “no significant impacts” from the trial events."

"content" : "Exeter City Council has granted full planning consent for four purpose built student accommodation blocks on the 1.85 acre site of the Johnsons laundry and workwear factory in Cowley Bridge Road, which became vacant following a fire in 2020.The blocks will be up to six storeys tall and provide 350 bedspaces in a combination of 154 studios and 35 cluster flats.They will follow the form established by four existing neighbouring purpose built student accommodation blocks by providing sight of green space on the other side of the adjacent railway and river through gaps between buildings.Risks resulting from the development’s location in the River Exe valley flood plain will be addressed by its design and the provision of emergency escape routes.A communal space on the ground floor of one of the new blocks will be made available for community use and the development will include the provision of a pedestrian and cycle route along its frontage, where there is currently no pavement.Illustrative elevations facing Cowley Bridge Road. Image: Exeter City Council.Local ward councillor Michael Mitchell, quoting county council figures that show around 10,000 students bring cars to Exeter each year at Monday’s planning committee meeting, sought a planning consent condition requiring that the development would be truly “car free”, as described.The response was that only two residents would be granted permits for the disabled parking bays on the site, and the provision of cycling storage and space for an electric bike hire scheme would “encourage” others not to drive.When pressed to include a clause in the building management plan to prohibit residents from bringing cars to the city, the response was that the third-party site operator would “discourage” their use.

Purpose built student accommodation has been anticipated on the site since it became vacant, because of its proximity to the university’s Streatham campus in an area of the city that is now almost entirely dedicated to providing student accommodation.Community balance was not mentioned in the council planning case officer’s report on the development proposals.Although the site was previously in employment use, the council did not consider protecting this use because of its context.Full details of the application can be viewed on the city council website."

"content" : "The University of Exeter has announced its receipt of two UK social mobility “silver awards” which it said: “recognise and celebrate UK organisations that are making strides and creating initiatives to advance social mobility”.It added: “We are pleased our work has been recognised as part of these prestigious awards.”However the previous week the university was ranked 92nd in this year’s Higher Education Policy Institute Social Mobility Index, which compares the performance of 101 higher education providers in England.The university was the worst performing member of the Russell Group in the index, eighteen places below the University of Durham, the next worst performing member of the group of self-selected “elite” universities.The University of Bradford came top, with Aston University in second place and City, University of London in third.London Russell Group members King’s College, the London School of Economics, Queen Mary and University College all also appeared in the top ten higher education institutions ranked in the list.The Higher Education Policy Institute is the UK’s only independent research institute that focusses solely on higher education.Its social mobility index measures the social distance travelled by graduates from each institution by combining access, continuation and outcomes measures for undergraduates for all modes of study except apprenticeships.University of Exeter social mobility awards promotional graphicIn contrast, the UK Social Mobility Awards offer “a unique branding opportunity”, according to its organisers, which “profiles your organisation as a leader in social mobility” while offering “invaluable media exposure”.The awards’ principal sponsor is Amazon, which has been extensively criticized for the ethics of its business practices and is currently facing a US Federal Trade Commission lawsuit for employing “anticompetitive and unfair strategies”.Secondary sponsors include Callsign, a “passive authentication” and “digital identity” intelligence provider, outsourcing company Capita, which recently broke the law by failing to pay its employees the minimum wage, and CMC Markets, which provides spread betting, CFD and stock trading platforms.Other secondary sponsors are BNP Paribas, PwC, Stagecoach, Sky and Barclays.Organisations are invited to nominate themselves for the awards, which are announced at a black tie dinner for around 500 guests at a luxury hotel in Bayswater where rooms start at around £400 per night.From a nominations shortlist of 53 organisations and eighteen individuals, the 25 judges on this year’s panel (including representatives of banks, outsourcing firms and retailers) identified thirteen winners and another 92 gold, silver and bronze “honour roll” social mobility champions, among them the University of Exeter.All the entrants won at least one of the 105 awards announced at this year’s ceremony.UK Social Mobility Awards gala promotional imageThe university’s performance in the 2023 Higher Education Policy Institute Social Mobility Index follows a landmark 2021 study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, in partnership with The Sutton Trust and the Department for Education.This placed it joint bottom among Russell Group universities and 103rd overall in a social mobility league table.The study analysed data on socio-economic background, education pathways and adult labour market outcomes for several entire school cohorts, covering close to the full population of England, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the ways in which higher education attendance influences social mobility chances.Queen Mary, University of London, recorded the highest mobility rate among a group of top-performing higher education institutions which combine high access rates for students from disadvantaged backgrounds with high levels of labour market success.The study recommended several changes, including increased use of widening participation and social mobility measures in university rankings.It also suggested that the most selective universities make more ambitious use of contextual admissions to widen access by making reduced grade offers to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, reaching out to attract applicants from more diverse communities and providing direct financial support.

Meanwhile recent University of Exeter research has found that young people in the South West are the least likely to attend university in the country.At age seventeen just 36% say they are very likely to go to university, compared with 63% of young people in London. 42% subsequently attend university, compared with 61% of those in London.The researchers found that South West higher education access barriers, such as poor public transport and internet access, do not fully explain why teenagers from the region have lower aspirations and progression rates than their peers elsewhere."

"content" : "New Office of National Statistics (ONS) research has found that Exeter has nearly 3,100 vacant and empty second homes, 5.6% of the city’s stock of 55,600 houses and far more than previously thought.A city council analysis based on council tax exemptions found only just over 300 empty homes in the city when it proposed additional council tax charges for underused housing stock in February.The ONS research, published last month, combined 2021 census data with NHS, DVLA, Department for Education and other datasets and field visits to derive its findings.It also found that the South West has the highest proportion of empty second homes in England and Wales and the highest proportion of unoccupied dwellings in use as second homes.More than 150,000 homes across the region are entirely unoccupied and another 33,000 are second homes that have no usual residents.The Isles of Scilly has the highest proportion of empty second homes in the country while South Hams has the same proportion as the London Borough of Kensington &amp;amp; Chelsea.Across England there were more than 1.5 million unoccupied dwellings on census day in March 2021 of which nearly 90% were truly vacant and just over 10% were empty second homes.Exeter housingVacant dwellings are houses or flats that have no usual residents and are not used as a second home or by visitors.Empty second homes are dwellings that are occasionally inhabited by short-term residents but are usually not occupied.Neither category accounts for dwellings that have no usual residents because they are used as second homes for more than 30 days each year. There are an additional 1.625 million of these in England alone.Nearly 200,000 of these are in the South West including more than 4,000 in Exeter. Some are used by the armed forces, but many more are in use by students and tourists.The South West also has the highest concentration of holiday homes in the country.Rough sleeper sheltering at Exeter GuildhallThe Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has also just found that nearly 28,000 households across the South West experienced statutory homelessness in 2022-23 of which more than 1,100 were in Exeter.These numbers have been increasing in recent years despite the efforts of local and regional charities and other homelessness prevention and support service providers.The principal causes of homelessness for these households is the end of private sector tenancies, many of which are the result of “no fault” evictions, and no longer being able to stay with friends or family, a situation often described as “sofa surfing”.Both are increasing as causes of homelessness across the region, as is domestic abuse, which also figures prominently. More than 18,000 households experienced statutory homelessness across the South West for these reasons alone last year.

Rough sleeping has also been rising in Exeter and across the South West since the government’s “Everyone In” initiative moved thousands of rough sleepers into hostels and hotel rooms at the height of the pandemic.Nearly nine times more people were helped under the scheme than the government’s official measure of rough sleepers, which is derived from a “snapshot” count of rough sleepers on a single night between 1 October and 30 November each year.The number of rough sleepers in Exeter has doubled in the past two years: they now make up more than a quarter of those applying for relief from statutory homelessness in the city, more than six times as many as Exeter’s official homelessness count.St Petrock’s director Peter Stephenson said yesterday, in response to the home secretary’s proposals to make it an offence for charities to give tents to rough sleepers, that Exeter is “experiencing the highest ever level of rough sleeping in the city”.He added: “Homelessness and rough sleeping is a political choice, not a personal one.”"

"content" : "A series of appeals by JCDecaux against city council decisions to refuse applications for illuminated advertising screens in the centre of Exeter have been dismissed by planning inspectors.The “multifunction hubs” proposed by the French company would have been sited opposite the Iceland supermarket in Sidwell Street, near the entrance to Next in Paris Street and beside the Oxfam shop in South Street.Each hub would have been eight and a half feet tall, nearly four and a half feet wide and more than a foot deep, with an overhanging canopy.Dominated by an illuminated advertising screen on one side that is more than seven feet tall, the company pitches its hubs as offering a “range of services” including wi-fi, device charging, public messaging capabilities and a defibrillator.A secondary 32 inch touchscreen can also be used to show advertising.It says the hubs “boast” half-inch thick anti-vandal toughened glass surfaces and are “intended” as free to use. However it adds that “some units will have a more restricted use policy” which limits access to services.Each hub consumes an average of 28.1 kWh per day, the equivalent of 234 modern domestic lightbulbs being switched on all the time.JCDecaux illuminated street advertising screen. Image: JCDecaux.JCDecaux submitted applications for a total of six illuminated advertising screens in the city centre in October last year before withdrawing one near Bedford Square and another on the the corner of Bedford Place and High Street.The city council refused all four remaining applications in February, saying the proposed units would be “incongruous and unduly prominent” and would be “detrimental to visual amenity and the character and the appearance of the local townscape”.It also refused the applications for screens in South Street and another in front of the High Street Boots on the grounds both would harm nearby heritage assets.JCDecaux then appealed all four decisions, submitting two appeals against each.

One planning inspector dismissed the Sidwell Street appeals by confirming that the hub would be “large and overbearing” at street level and would materially harm the character, appearance and visual amenity of the area.They acknowledged the inclusion of ostensibly community-oriented services in the proposed hub but said these are “likely to be a secondary function” to the advertising, while noting the existing provision of defibrillators and wi-fi in the city centre.Another inspector dismissed both Paris Street and South Street appeals, saying the hubs would be “overly dominant and visually intrusive” as well as “particularly noticeable and harmful in the hours of darkness”, adding that their claimed benefits would be “very limited”.They also concluded that a South Street hub would harm the setting of nearby listed buildings.A decision on the High Street hub appeals is expected shortly."

"content" : "Developer Bloor Homes has submitted a reserved matters application for the third phase of its Seabrook Orchards estate which would mean it would not meet a key threshold specified in its site-wide planning agreement with the city council.The outline application for up to 700 dwellings and supporting infrastructure at the low density greenfield development between Newcourt and Topsham was originally approved in January 2012.Planning permission was subsequently granted by the city council in October 2013 on the condition, among others, that a junction connecting Dart Avenue with Admiral Way to enable multi-modal travel accessibility at the northern end of the development would be constructed.The condition would be triggered once more than 650 dwellings were occupied.337 dwellings have so far been constructed and another 108 granted planning consent in earlier phases of the development. The final phase would add another 204 to bring the total to 649, one less than the threshold at which the transport infrastructure is required.Seabrook Orchards phase three illustration. Image: LHC Design.A statement accompanying the application says that access to the final phase of the development will be via the existing road network, from the Topsham Road end, apparently confirming the developer’s intention not to meet the planning condition.The statement also says that cycling access “has been considered” but does not say that it will be delivered.An existing walking and cycling route that connected the development to adjacent Vernon Crescent via Fish Street has recently been blocked, apparently with intent to create a ransom strip.Exeter Cycling Campaign says that this has presented “particular difficulties for children and parents travelling by foot, scooter or bike from Newcourt to the school and safely onto Topsham”.It adds that access at this location should be included as a planning condition for the final phase permission and that it  “requires urgent attention to unblock again”.

Seabrook Orchards Residents Group represents more than 150 households already living in the development.It says that the final phase application “does not adequately address pedestrian and cycle connectivity between Seabrook Orchards and the Greater Newcourt area” and is “seeking to actively avoid delivery” of the transport connections stipulated in the planning agreement.Commenting on the application, residents group committee member Andrew Sails says that many residents who bought houses in the second phase of the development did so on the basis of “oral assurances by the Bloor sales office that direct vehicular access to the rest of Newcourt was to follow”.He adds that the planning condition requiring transport infrastructure “as originally envisaged” should be adjusted to ensure that it is delivered as planned.Bloor Homes is one of the largest privately-owned housebuilders in the UK. The net worth of its owner John Bloor is estimated to be $1.4 billion.There have been 70 public comments in response to the application in the past fortnight of which 69 are objections and none are in support.Comments on the proposals can be submitted via the city council website where the application details can be viewed in full."

"content" : "Maketank, an artists’ collective that transformed a vacant three-storey building in Paris Street into a thriving independent community arts centre, has been forced to close.The venue opened in 2019 with the support of Exeter Phoenix following the closure of The Bike Shed Theatre after its eight year run in Fore Street.Billed as a “cultural laboratory for social change”, Maketank has hosted hundreds of workshops, performances, exhibitions and events that have showcased local creativity and has supported projects including educational charity Exeter Science Centre.It also led Exeter’s reception of Ukrainian refugees with the launch of The Conversation Café in an empty Princesshay shopping centre retail unit opposite Maketank in March last year.The community-led resource hub will not be directly affected by Maketank’s closure.Maketank window displayMaketank closed its doors on 10 October, nine months after it was first given notice that its lease would not be renewed by The Crown Estate and its partner Nuveen Real Estate.The Crown Estate is a UK property portfolio worth around £17 billion which belongs to the British sovereign but is managed by a semi-independent body.The notice followed the emergence of problems last year with the roof of the Maketank building which may have posed risks to its occupants and required recovering rather than running repairs.Maketank says that The Crown Estate cited unspecified health and safety risks and “refuse[d] to enter into dialogue” despite what it describes as “enquiries and letters of support from multiple key stakeholders” including the city council, county council and university.The Crown Estate says that all its Paris Street and Sidwell Street tenants, who have short-term and/or peppercorn leases, are aware of longer-term plans to demolish the buildings for redevelopment.A spokesperson said: “The Crown Estate recognises the important work of Maketank in the local community and has been happy to provide premises at no cost.“However, due to increasing health and safety concerns about the condition of the roof, we have taken the difficult decision not to further extend the lease and vacate the premises having given the tenant an additional eight months to find alternative premises.”Maketank exhibitionThe future of the area has been in doubt since the September 2017 failure of previous proposals for its redevelopment, to be led by The Crown Estate and Nuveen, which were supposed to be delivered in parallel with the council-funded construction of the bus station and leisure centre.An extension of the existing Princesshay shopping centre was envisaged that was presented as “a comprehensive retail-leisure led mixed use development”.Exeter City Council, which owns much of the site, granted outline planning permission for the plans in July 2016. To prepare for demolition The Crown Estate then began terminating leases on Sidwell Street and Paris Street.The council was upbeat until September 2017 when its leader and chief executive were summoned to London to be told The Crown Estate would not be proceeding with the plans after all because of market conditions.It subsequently commissioned an outline plan for a new development from Jones Lang LaSalle, the firm which presented the as-yet unbuilt Harlequins redevelopment proposals in 2020.The plan, which the council agreed in December 2018, included several build to rent blocks, two hotels, extensive office space and some ground floor retail and food outlet provision.They also included a new civic centre for the council to move into so it could redevelop its offices on the other side of the road.It entailed the demolition of the remaining buildings on the site to enable the construction of a total of just under a million square feet of new buildings, nearly twice the size of Princesshay.CityPoint redevelopment scheme drawingBusinesses ranging from independent retailers to chain stories left. The council then revisited the redevelopment plan in September 2019, when it agreed to progress the scheme by entering into a joint ownership and land promotion agreement with the other main partners.It then reviewed the scheme’s viability again in the context of the coronavirus pandemic in June 2020, when it decided to “accelerate the development process”.It said it was “keen to ensure that we look to maintain momentum on key projects such as this which will define the city’s future as we emerge from the pandemic”. This was principally supposed to be on the basis of “very strong investor demand for opportunities in the Built to Rent sector”.In September 2021 council leader Phil Bialyk said it was hoping to deliver the first phase of development, its new civic centre, with help of the Government Property Agency and the University of Exeter, which wants to construct an “innovation hub” on the site.He said it would be “some years” before anything happened to the Paris Street and Sidwell Street retail units and added that the council “will want to work with whoever our partners are at the appropriate time to accommodate all those people who are currently there should they wish to remain. That is what we would want to do.”Maketank studioIn August last year Jones Lang Lasalle produced a review of Exeter employment sites that forms part of the evidence base for the new Exeter Local Plan.It said the “public sector and speculative Grade A offices” included in the CityPoint redevelopment plan were both viable and deliverable.However it then downgraded their “deliverability” in another assessment of employment sites it produced for the new local plan evidence base three months later.In March this year the council’s finance director said that economic conditions make the CityPoint redevelopment “challenging”, but confirmed that the council still hopes to deliver something based on the Jones Lang Lasalle plan that was now agreed nearly five years ago.The council apparently does not consider Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and interest rate rises, and all their effects on the construction sector and property markets, sufficient cause to question the viability of the scheme despite wanting residents to accept these as major causes of Exeter City Living’s development delivery failures during the same period.Maketank print studioThe ongoing saga leaves the independent businesses and community and culture organisations that have pioneered an unplanned renaissance in the East Gate area, which the council describes as a “tired area of the city”, in perpetual precarity.Among them Maketank is determined to continue, despite there being no sign of the council leader’s pledge to step in.In a statement the project said it “will be using all the richness of the last five years to build a campaign for a purpose-built cultural space in the city centre, one with the capacity to support the diverse range of stakeholders Maketank has been known for – and many more”.Those who would like to contribute are invited to get in touch at hello@maketank.org.uk or by completing an online form."

"content" : "A six month statutory public consultation on the Heavitree &amp;amp; Whipton Active Streets trial is about to restart, three months after it began in August, extending the period during which residents and organisations can submit feedback on the scheme until May next year.The consultation restart follows Devon County Council’s decision to allow taxis to use both the bus gates that have been installed in the scheme trial area. Taxis will also now be allowed to pass through the bus gates that were installed in Wonford Road in 2020.A new Experimental Traffic Regulation Order for the scheme will be advertised from tomorrow and come into force on 9 November. The extension to the public consultation that it will trigger will not be reflected in the overall scheme trial length, which will remain eighteen months unless the county council decides to end it early.Previous consultation responses will be included in the county council’s deliberations over whether to make the scheme permanent. The scheme is intended to reduce motor vehicle through traffic and increase walking and cycling in the trial area, in which around 17,000 people live.Alterations to the three modal filters that have been installed in the area and the temporary waiting restrictions that have been introduced on Ladysmith Road are not currently planned.An interim report on the scheme was presented to a meeting of Devon County Council’s Exeter Highways and Traffic Orders Committee on Monday.It says that the consultation prompted more than 4,000 responses in its first eleven weeks and that a total of 1,650 people attended four public exhibitions held to promote the scheme in July and September.The report says both opposition to and support for the scheme was expressed by September event attendees. The July events were held before the trial began so feedback from these events has not been included in the consultation, although the county council noted strong opposition at both.The county council says that data gathered in the first two months of the scheme trial shows varying traffic increases at the five trial area boundary road locations it is monitoring.While the change on Honiton Road is negligible, the number of vehicles per day on Hill Barton Road has risen 11% to 16,945 – an increase of 1,707 vehicles per day.At the same time walking and cycling has increased at all but one of the six locations that are being monitored inside the trial area. The fall occurred on Roseland Crescent, a cul-de-sac that leads to Heavitree Pleasure Ground.Changes in both also range from negligible to as much as a 41% increase in cycling on Park Road. This equates to an increase of 37 cycles per day from a pre-trial level of 90 cycles per day.Ladysmith Road saw the largest walking increase. 106 additional pedestrians increased the count to 531 pedestrians per day, a rise of 25%.Air quality monitoring will also form part of the trial. New sensors will be installed in four locations on the Heavitree Road corridor in the next few weeks which will provide more refined real-time data than the existing sensors, which are limited to providing monthly averages.Four new sensors will also be installed inside the scheme trial area.So many members of the public sought to attend Monday’s meeting that around fifteen of the 50 or so who tried to get in had to watch through the doors from the corridor.Seven speakers, of whom three are Conservative city councillors, made vehement and sometimes strongly-worded arguments, six of them against the scheme.One inflammatory speech warned of a “day of reckoning” coming the way of obstinate committee members in the form of an “electoral firestorm”.Each of the six prompted loud applause, cheers and banging from many members of the public. Silence followed the single speaker in favour, a senior climate scientist who said he was speaking on behalf of a large group of residents.Various committee members then had their say, most adding little. County council officers confirmed that the next scheme trial update, due in January, would include air quality data from the new sensors as well as more feedback derived from consultation responses and other data.They also said they would assess whether the scheme trial was having wider impacts on the city’s roads and emphasised the limits of the data they had so far collected.

"content" : "Exeter City Council is holding a public consultation on the full draft version of the new Exeter Local Plan, which will guide development in the city until 2040.It follows an initial “issues” consultation held in autumn 2021, and a longer consultation on the outline draft version of the plan which took place at the end of last year.Responses were invited via a dedicated website which encourages respondents to use emoticons and choose from pre-selected options to express their views, alongside per-policy text boxes.The council received just under 4,000 responses to this consultation. Emma Morse, the city councillor responsible for the new local plan, says the responses were “integral” to developing the full draft version of the plan, which contains twice as many policies as the outline draft version.It includes what the council describes as “the vision for the city”, alongside planning policies and potential development sites.The council is inviting responses to the current draft of the plan by the same methods.It is also possible to upload PDF and image responses, enabling residents and businesses to address the SPD as a whole, or in selective parts, as well as the submission of comments or ideas that do not fit into the council’s framework.The council says it would prefer people to follow its prescriptive approach, which encourages simple feedback and addresses one policy at a time. A printable consultation response form is also provided which reflects the same structure.The plan is accompanied by an evidence base comprising several dozen documents which address plan-related issues including the city’s carbon footprint, local housing and employment needs, the availability of development land and landscape sensitivity.These vary widely in relevance and quality. A September 2017 retail study and some design sketches dating back to 2011 are both included while Exeter City Futures’ Net Zero Exeter plan is presented alongside a University of Exeter study that largely discredits it.New Exeter Local Plan consultation response optionsFeedback is also being invited on an updated sustainability appraisal and a revised habitats regulation assessment, both of which replace a similar reports produced for last year’s outline draft plan consultation.These attempt to evaluate the plan’s social, economic and environmental impact on Exeter and its impact on internationally important biodiversity sites in and around the city, such as the River Exe estuary.There are other additions to the new local plan evidence base since the outline draft consultation.These include University of Exeter studies of heat networks and renewable energy generation potential and a note on energy and carbon standards.They also include interim and final area economic development needs assessments, a “Liveable Water Lane” development design proposals summary and a playing pitch strategy that was adopted by the council at the end of last year.There have been some amendments to the development sites proposed in the plan between the outline and full draft versions.Planning permission has since been granted on two of the sites, and two of the council’s Liveable Exeter brownfield sites have been withdrawn: Sandy Gate and the West Gate site at Exe Bridges. Some residential site boundaries have also been revised.Employment sites have been added at the university’s St Luke’s campus, the Toby Carvery at Middlemoor and two sites in Newcourt. None were included in the outline draft of the plan.High-resolution maps that show the proposed site designations are also provided. These show citywide and city centre land allocations in detail.The council is holding a series of public exhibitions at which planning officers are available to answer questions on the plan.It ran fourteen such events, covering every electoral ward in the city, during last year’s outline draft consultation and has so far announced nine this time.These run until 12 December, although the full draft plan consultation remains open through the holidays until 15 January next year.The council has simultaneously opened consultations on two other new planning policy documents, a Water Lane Supplementary Planning Document and a domestic extension and alterations Supplementary Planning Document.Both these consultations run until 4 December. A single additional public exhibition dedicated to the Water Lane proposals is being held from 1-7pm on Monday 6 November at Exeter Custom House on Exeter Quay.However council officers are available to answer questions about all aspects of local planning policy at all the public exhibitions below.Printed copies of all the council’s planning policy consultation documents can be viewed in the reception area at the Civic Centre and in libraries across the city.Any queries can be directed to the council planning policy team at planning.policy@exeter.gov.uk or on 01392 265080.

Exeter’s includes one such plan which covers the St James area.An existing evidence base also supports and informs current local planning policy development.The timetable for the preparation of the new local plan is set out in the Local Development Scheme, which was last updated in June this year.  September 2021: an initial consultation which framed the content and scope of the plan was held from 20 September to 17 November 2021 to which there were 215 responses  September 2022: an outline draft plan was published for a public consultation running from 26 September to 19 December 2022 to which there were just under 4,000 responses from around 1,500 respondents and 1,000 exhibition attendees  October 2023: a full draft plan has just been published for a public consultation running from 23 October 2023 to 15 January 2024  October 2024: a revised detailed draft plan (the “publication” version) will be published for formal comments (“representations”) on its legal compliance and soundness  March 2025: the resulting detailed draft final plan will be submitted to the planning inspectorate with formal comments and supporting evidence  June 2025: a planning inspector will examine the submissions, hold plan examination hearings, propose changes (which may entail further consultation) then produce a final report  December 2025: the final plan will be adopted if the timetable doesn’t slip further – it is currently eighteen months behind the original schedule.Plan preparation progress is set out in annual monitoring reports (one covering 2022-23 is due by the end of this year) while periodic statements set out the city’s five year housing land supply position.Only those who submit formal comments at the revised detailed draft plan publication stage can attend and take part in plan examination hearings.The council says the “Exeter Plan” is “the new name” for the new Exeter Local Plan. This appears to imply it will provide an overarching strategy for the city when adopted. This is not the case.National planning system reforms based on ideas which survived the 2020 planning white paper have been on their way via the government’s 2022 Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill at the same time as the council has been drafting the new Exeter Local Plan.The bill received Royal Assent yesterday after extensive parliamentary ping-pong over its final content, and is now an Act of Parliament.This means that a host of new laws affecting the planning system have just come into force, three days after the council consultation opened, and the government is now expected to make sweeping changes to the National Planning Policy Framework in the near future.Mandatory authority-wide design codes are to be introduced, a new approach to developer contributions is to replace the current Section 106 and Community Infrastructure Levy regimes, and “environmental outcomes reports” will take the place of EU environmental impact and strategic environmental assessments.The “duty to co-operate” has been removed, compulsory purchase order and development corporation powers have been extended and local councils which have a local plan that is less than five years old will no longer have to maintain a five-year supply of housing land.Prospective changes also include the replacement of neighbourhood plan-making with more accessible community “neighbourhood priorities” powers and the introduction of a “street votes” system.But they limit the scope of local plans to “locally specific” matters and give government much greater powers in local planning decisions via National Development Management Policies which will not be subject to advance scrutiny in Parliament and which local councillors will have to follow in making individual planning decisions.

Dozens of other local planning authorities around the country have been putting local plan development on hold until the government’s planning system overhaul, which also includes major changes to local plan-making itself, is complete.Three weeks ago a report to a meeting of Exeter City Council’s Executive committee identified “significant changes to the planning system” which “could affect the scope of the Exeter Plan” but simply said they would be “taken into consideration in the emerging plan”.Major changes have already been made between the outline draft and full draft versions of the new Exeter Local Plan.Whether the version that is now out for consultation will require further significant revision to conform with national planning system reforms before its publication version is produced and submitted for inspection, and how many of those reforms will actually take place, is not yet clear.Exeter Observer will examine the full draft of the new Exeter Local Plan as the consultation takes place.We’ll cover the plan’s evidence base, the policies it proposes and also look at what’s not in the plan but should be.Subscribe to The Exeter Digest, our essential free email newsletter, to make sure you don’t miss our new Exeter Local Plan coverage."

"content" : "Exeter City Council is holding a public consultation on the draft version of a Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) for a large canalside development site centred on Water Lane.SPDs are intended to extend existing local plans to provide more detail on their policies. They cannot introduce new policies into the existing development plan.The SPD is intended to provide a development framework and design code for the 90 acre site, which is part of the council’s Liveable Exeter scheme, and will inform individual planning decisions about the 1,600 new dwellings and employment spaces that are expected there.Most of the Water Lane site was allocated for development in the Exeter Local Plan First Review, which was adopted in 2005 and followed by the 2012 Exeter Core Strategy, which proposed the production of a Water Lane development masterplan.It extends from Haven Banks retail park, where ultra high-density redevelopment proposals have generated significant local opposition, to the Grace Road playing fields alongside Marsh Barton incinerator.It also includes the former gas tower site which has recently been marketed for redevelopment. Outline plans for a section of the site stretching from Clapperbridge Lane to Tan Lane were submitted in August after the council agreed to use its compulsory purchase powers to enable vehicle access to the site.Water Lane SPD development framework and design code site boundaryThe Water Lane draft SPD consultation is taking place in parallel with a consultation on the full draft of the new Exeter Local Plan, which will replace both these planning policy frameworks when it is adopted and which also allocates the Water Lane area as a development site.However the Water Lane SPD is expected to become a material consideration in local planning decisions concerning the area it covers well before the adoption of the new Exeter Local Plan.This is currently not expected until December 2025. After adoption, the Water Lane SPD will continue to inform planning decisions on the site, although it may require revision to align fully with the new plan.New Exeter Local Plan Water Lane site allocationThe Water Lane draft SPD aims to co-ordinate development proposals across the site by imposing design and infrastructure requirements that would combine to yield a coherent neighbourhood by the time development is complete in around 2040.The mostly brownfield site presents a range of development challenges including contamination, access restrictions, impact on existing residents and proximity to the adjacent mainline railway.Flood risk is a major barrier, particularly since the Environment Agency recently said that most new residential development in the River Exe floodplain could only provide uses – including daytime-only uses – at fist floor and above when it forced the redesign of co-living proposals at Exeland House in Tudor Street.The site is also divided into many parcels of land in multiple ownership making the masterplanning it requires to address its constraints more difficult.The failure of Exeter City Living, the council’s property development company, to develop less challenging brownfield sites in other parts of the city despite the significant advantages it enjoyed over other private sector developers suggests that viability issues will play a major role in determining planning applications at Water Lane when they come forward.Water Lane SPD regulating plan, identifying which spatial codes apply to individual planning applicationsComments on the SPD are invited via a dedicated website which encourages respondents to use emoticons and choose from pre-selected options to express their views, alongside per-policy text boxes.It is also possible to upload PDF and image responses, enabling residents and businesses to address the SPD as a whole, or in selective parts, as well as the submission of comments or ideas that do not fit into the council’s framework.The council says it would prefer people to follow its prescriptive approach, which encourages simple feedback and addresses one policy at a time. A printable consultation response form is also provided which reflects the same structure.Several appendices that are integral to the SPD include an Environment Agency area flood risk map and a summary of “input from the community and stakeholders through multiple engagement methods” that the council says has been used to develop the SPD.

"content" : "Devon County Council allocated 87% of its total transport infrastructure expenditure to motor vehicle infrastructure in 2022-23, the same as the previous year, while 4% went to walking and 5% to cycling after a reduction in rail expenditure.Figures acquired from the county council under local authority accounts inspection legislation show road spending dominating both its capital and revenue spending across new and existing infrastructure last year.New walking infrastructure constituted only 1% of total capital transport infrastructure expenditure in 2022-23, less than the previous year, while new cycling infrastructure represented 3.75% of the total after rising from £2.4 million to £3.5 million.Combined, less than £4.5 million of county council capital transport expenditure was allocated to new active travel infrastructure, and less still to its maintenance.A single project, a pedestrian and cycle bridge spanning the A379 to facilitate the controversial South West Exeter extension, is responsible for nearly £2 million of this spending.Motor vehicle infrastructure, in contrast, received more than three quarters of new county council capital expenditure on transport infrastructure, an increase on the previous year, and nearly 93% of its transport maintenance expenditure.Roads received nearly £80 million of a total of £92.5 million 2022-23 capital transport infrastructure spending, with Marsh Barton railway station receiving another £4.3 million.The county council spent £1.2 million more  on enhancing the A361 alone than it spent on all the county’s new walking, cycling and rail infrastructure combined. Active travel funding capital expenditure in Exeter amounted to £430,000.County council revenue spending on new transport infrastructure, which is much lower than capital expenditure on new transport infrastructure, was £700,000 for the same year.£400,000 (58%) of this was spent on motor vehicle infrastructure of which £375,000 was used for changes to junction 28 of the M5.Devon County Council doesn’t normally distinguish between expenditure on walking, cycling, rail and motor vehicle infrastructure in its transport finance records, frustrating cost/benefit analysis of active travel interventions.While it was able to break down its capital expenditure on transport infrastructure into different travel modes when questioned under accounts inspection legislation, it was unable to do the same for its £24 million 2022-23 revenue spending on transport infrastructure maintenance.Active Travel England guidance says that, unless more detailed information is held, local transport authorities should “assume 9% of highways maintenance is for cycling and walking which is the average percentage assumed by the department”.Doing so would mean that just over £2 million of this money went to active travel infrastructure maintenance while nearly £21.5 million was spent on motor vehicle infrastructure.Combining these capital and revenue figures shows that, overall, the county council allocated £4.6 million of its total 2022-23 transport infrastructure expenditure to walking, £6.25 million to cycling and £101.5 million to motor vehicles – 87% of the total.Devon County Council’s transport capital programme for 2023-25 continues to allocate most of its capital expenditure on new transport infrastructure to roads.The updated programme it agreed last week allocates £128 million to road schemes, £13 million to active travel and £11 million to public transport.The schemes are slightly overprogrammed to allow for delivery timetable slippage: the county council intends to spend around £155 million in total during this period, including £17 million on infrastructure for the low-tax Plymouth and South Devon Freeport.It says that its transport schemes are “varied, but all will look to support the council’s vision for sustainable, low carbon economic growth and safe and better-connected communities”.The county council also says its programme “seeks to invest in transport interventions that respond to the climate emergency, supports sustainable economic recovery, improves health and well-being and helps communities to be safe, connected and resilient”.It awards its transport strategy maximum positive impact scores on actions including prioritising sustainable travel and transport, encouraging sustainable lifestyles and giving people “greater opportunities for walking and cycling to increase their physical activity”.It is not clear how the programme’s road schemes, which it describes as “multi-modal/highway improvements” and which comprise 84% of its planned capital expenditure, deliver the active or sustainable travel benefits the county council claims.Of the £213 million in transport capital funding it says is “successfully secured”, which includes £60 million for the A361 North Devon link road and £38 million for the A382 Drumbridges to Newton Abbot road, just £3.3 million is for active travel schemes."

"content" : "Exeter’s employment rate – the proportion of adult residents aged 16-64 who work – is the second lowest in the south west for the second year running, according to figures published by the Office of National Statistics.The city’s employment rate was 72.8% in the year to March 2023, having decreased slightly since last year. Only South Hams was lower.The employment rate in Torridge is 87.4%, nearly 15% higher than in Exeter. The average employment rate across the South West last year was 78.4%, after increasing since last year.Exeter has among the region’s lowest employment rates despite its working age population being proportionally much larger, at just over 68% compared with less than 61% across the South West.Half the city’s residents are employed in around 65,000 jobs. Another 43,000 people commute into the city for work, 40% of the workforce, driving high levels of congestion on Exeter’s arterial routes. The city has the second highest travel to work population in the country.Economic inactivity levels – the proportion of working age adults who are not employed but do not meet the criteria for being unemployed – remain higher in Exeter than across the South West, at 24.2% compared with 19.3%.Working age adults are often economically inactive because they are studying full-time or retired, among other reasons.The council commissioned comprehensive research last year that was intended to underpin Exeter’s post-pandemic approach to employment and skills.It identified low and falling economic activity levels, particularly among the over 50’s and young people aged 20-24, as key reasons for the city’s ongoing recruitment challenges.It said Exeter would need at least 3,500 more healthcare workers by 2030, which might be an underestimate “given the acute ageing population in Devon where Exeter provides a major health and care centre for the surrounding local authorities who all have rapidly ageing populations”.The research found there were 6,000 healthcare vacancies in the area already.At the same time it said Exeter’s apparently young population was belied by low graduate retention rates resulting from low pay, high housing costs and poor employment prospects.Instead the city’s “very high inflows of 15 to 19 year-olds” is “mirrored by comparative outflows for ages 20-24”.In response to a freedom of information request the university confirmed that 30,000 students were based at its Exeter campuses in 2022-23.While this was a fall from the previous year, the 29,600 students remaining after distance learners are excluded made up 23% of Exeter’s population last year.Two days before the employment rate statistics were published, the city council’s finance director warned its Executive committee that the council has so many staff vacancies that the money being saved on wages is disguising its poor income-generating performance, which would otherwise mean a service delivery shortfall.In the same week city councillor Ruth Williams told a council scrutiny committee that not only was the council unable to recruit workers to collect the city’s bins it was also unable to recruit workers to deliver bins for other workers to collect.The council’s recent decision to remove a quarter of the city’s litter bins was partly driven by a need to restructure its refuse collection services around fewer staff than it would like to meet demand.There are now around 550 litter bins and 90 dog waste bins in the city, down from a total of around 800, but the council has already begun replacing some of the bins it removed after being pelted with complaints by unhappy residents.

The council’s corporate risk register confirms that “a rise in residents becoming economically inactive, particularly those in the 50+ age groups” and “low levels of graduate retention from the University of Exeter” are key challenges for the city’s economy.The day before the employment rate statistics were published, it nevertheless celebrated its listing by a consumer magazine as one of twelve top UK retirement destinations. Council leader Phil Bialyk has since said that this is “more good news” for Exeter."

"content" : "A Just Stop Oil protest at the University of Exeter has put its finances under the spotlight a week after it topped a table of UK universities that are funded by fossil fuel companies.Protestor George Simonson occupied the roof of the entrance to the university’s Streatham campus Forum building on Tuesday afternoon for three hours, calling on students and staff to join the Just Stop Oil campaign to end new UK fossil fuel licensing and production.He used a fire extinguisher and spray cans to daub the building with red and orange paint and unfurled a Just Stop Oil banner before being dragged away by police to be arrested while onlookers cheered.Half an hour after his arrest, the university issued a press release accompanied by a photograph of six wind turbines saying it had “signalled its commitment to promoting academic research on sustainable finance and investment by joining a global research alliance”.Just Stop Oil protestor George Simonson on the University of Exeter Forum entrance porticoHis protest followed the publication of research last week that found that the University of Exeter is the largest beneficiary of more than £40.4 million that has been pledged to UK universities by oil, coal and gas companies since the beginning of 2022.The money takes the form of research agreements, tuition fees, scholarships, grants and consulting fees.The £14.7 million five-year deal the university signed with Shell in November last year means it is currently receiving more than twice as much fossil fuel financing as Imperial College, London, the next largest beneficiary on the list.DeSmog, a global research project focussed on challenging climate crisis misinformation, used freedom of information requests to compile the university funding figures.They do not include investments in fossil fuel companies held directly and indirectly by universities.Student campaign group People &amp;amp; Planet says that 3% of the University of Exeter’s £46.6 million investment portfolio was still invested in fossil fuel companies in July last year despite the university previously saying it does not invest in “entities that are involved in the extraction of fossil fuel”.An Open Democracy investigation previously found that UK universities had accepted £89 million in funding from eight of the largest oil firms between 2017 and the end of 2021.A crowd watches the Just Stop Oil protest at the University of Exeter this weekThe university’s Strategy 2030 says it intends to be a “recognised leader in organisational, financial and environmental sustainability” and adds: “Through our ethical partnerships and investments, we will maximise our positive impact on the world.”Last year Shell produced just 0.02% of its energy from renewable sources and intends to invest £33 billion in oil and gas production between 2023 and 2035.When news of the university’s deal with Shell was shared internally in November, James Dyke, an associate professor in Earth System Science and assistant director of the university’s Global Systems Institute, described the partnership as “a mistake”.He said it would put the university’s reputation at risk while also risking providing Shell with a social license to maintain its core fossil fuel operations.At Tuesday’s protest, he said: “The central claims of Just Stop Oil, as far as I can understand, are eminently sensible and backed by the science: no new oil and gas. If we don’t do that then we could be facing a particularly catastrophic future.”A University of Exeter spokesperson said its partnership with Shell, which began in 2007, will “contribute to the global race to net zero”.The University of Exeter’s Strategy 2030 visionThe university’s deal with Shell is only the tip of the iceberg. Last year it also accepted a £1 million grant from the Bezos Earth Fund.It announced the grant during a Global Systems Institute conference the day after a rocket launched by Blue Origin, a Jeff Bezos company, burst into a ball of flame shortly after take-off.The university published a report last year that found that the lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions of rockets launched from Spaceport Cornwall were comparatively small, provided they were compared with the terrestrial emissions of the whole of Cornwall.The report did not consider that the pollutants produced by rocket launches are released high in the atmosphere and so have a warming effect around 500 times greater than similar pollution sources closer to earth.Last year the university formed a “strategic partnership” with the new spaceport. A key objective is to establish it as the “world’s first net zero” rocket launch site.Green Futures Solutions, the University of Exeter’s “business support initiative”The university also has an established “strategic partnership” with investment management firm J.P. Morgan.The two have “enjoyed a close working relationship for several years”, according to a archived page on the university’s website. (The URL now redirects to a university commercialisation arm that “delivers game-changing sustainability solutions”.)In 2018 they began offering the “UK’s first financial services apprenticeship with a Russell Group degree”. They have since launched an “apprenticeship scheme for aspiring investment bankers”.According to research by a coalition of international NGOs, J.P. Morgan is the world’s largest financier of oil and gas projects, responsible for investing $51 billion in the sector in 2020 alone.The university says it is “redefining the role of business to provide leadership for a better world”.

In March this year the university also accepted an undisclosed sum, which it described as “transformational philanthropy”, from Sheikh Al Qasimi, the ruler of Sharjah.It will use the money to finance an extension to its Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies building, the construction of which the Sheikh previously funded.Sharjah is part of the United Arab Emirates, one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers. It owns one of the largest gas fields in the region.The United Arab Emirates has just held a major oil and gas conference, ahead of hosting the COP28 UN climate talks in Dubai in November.Attendees were urged to be “central to the solution” for climate change at the same time as they are increasing oil and gas production to profit from rising global energy prices."

Exeter City Living promotional material. Source: Exeter City Living.Seven years ago this month, Exeter City Council agreed to spend £350,000 on a “detailed feasibility study into the benefits of setting up a housing development company”. Eighteen months later it allocated another £260,000 to cover the cost of setting up the company and creating its first year business plan.A steering group of senior officers and councillors was created to oversee the process.Exeter City Living Ltd was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the council in June 2018. In July the council agreed to loan it £4.35 million to implement its first year business plan then another £5 million loan followed seven months later to finance the company’s second year.Less than twelve months afterwards, in January 2020, the council approved a third loan to the company, this time for nearly £16 million to enable it to buy, demolish and redevelop Clifton Hill sports centre, which it also agreed to sell to the company for £2.14 million, half its market value.It then agreed to spend another £300,000 on expanding the Exeter City Living company group through three new subsidiary companies: one to manage market rental property, a second to provide consultancy services and a third to deliver domestic retrofits.But the company’s third year business plan was nine months late, breaching the terms of its management agreement with the council. And the requirement that it produce a fourth year business plan was waived, in private, by the council’s then-chief executive Karime Hassan, who was appointed as the council’s company shareholder representative shortly afterwards.Council chief finance officer Dave Hodgson, who was appointed to the company board at the same time, and council leader Phil Bialyk also took part in the decision.Exeter City Living 2020-21 business plan project development delivery schedule. Source: Exeter City Living via freedom of information request, redacted.Despite this, the council then agreed a budget of £3.5 million for Exeter City Living to relocate a council depot at Belle Isle park and, without saying anything about the connection between the two decisions, agreed to sell the resulting development site to Exeter City Living for £2.2 million.By last April, the end of the company’s fourth trading year, the council had allocated nearly £1 million to company start up and business planning costs, approved loans of £25 million to finance its running costs and gifted it more than £2 million in land purchase discounts.The company had also been granted more than £7 million in central government financial support, yet it had only completed 22 housing units and had lost £3.3 million after posting income of just £36,000 the preceding financial year.A subsequent auditor’s report identified company governance weaknesses including its missing 2021-22 business plan, the lack of company performance reports and conflicts of interest created by council directors with statutory legal and financial responsibilities holding company board roles.The report also criticised the council’s practice of taking all its decisions related to the company in private and withholding company business plans and reports from the public.Exeter City Living financial projections. Accumulated losses of £8,934 million are expected by 2025-26. Source: Local Partnerships report.Karime Hassan nevertheless commended the company’s 2022-23 business plan (which was five months late) to councillors. He claimed the company was about to embark on “an ambitious phase of delivery” which would see it build as many as 675 new homes across thirteen sites in addition to the 155 flats and houses it had already committed to delivering.He urged councillors to “take a longer term view of the benefits that the company will bring” despite its business plan appearing “to show a company in financial trouble” on the grounds that “to see a particularly small development company, which is still in its infancy, make significant losses in the short term” is “not unusual”.He acknowledged that the proposed expansion would require a “substantial funding commitment” and asked councillors to approve loans for another £22.8 million, prospectively increasing the company’s loan balance to £44 million by 2024, which they did.The company itself claimed to be “coming of age”, on which basis it intended to double its staff of six to twelve, while its board members (which also by then included Baan Al-Khafaji, the council’s monitoring officer) were “comfortable that the risks, where Exeter City Living are in control, can be managed satisfactorily”.Exeter City Living 2022-23 administrative expenditure. Source: Local Partnerships report.In January this year it failed to find a contractor willing to take on the Clifton Hill site, having tried twice to tender the project, and Karime Hassan had to ask councillors to allow the company to submit its 2023-24 company business plan six months late. They agreed.By April, Exeter City Living had accumulated losses of £4.5 million against expenditure of £9.3 million. Its administration costs alone had reached £937,000 a year.An independent review of the company’s performance, governance and viability was announced in February, then postponed, before being announced again in June. It was to be delivered in April, then June, then September, before finally appearing on the agenda at Tuesday’s Executive committee meeting.The review, which Baan Al-Khafaji described as “prudent and timely”, was performed by Local Partnerships, an independent, arms-length body jointly owned by the Treasury, the Local Government Association and the Welsh Government. It cost £33,000.It is accompanied by a summary of Exeter City Living’s “activities and achievements” and a report by the council’s new chief executive, Bindu Arjoon.

It says the company has “around” £1.8 million in cash left, but owes money to creditors.Work in progress and the Clifton Hill site are together valued at just over £4 million. The company is also currently contributing just over £1 million to the council’s annual income, more than half of which is loan interest.Her report also confirms that the council is at risk of breaching the Prudential Code, which governs the way local authorities borrow and invest, because the company is relying on council borrowing to finance its running costs and repay its loans.It hasn’t quite crossed the line because the company’s total turnover since it was incorporated is currently greater than its total running costs and loan repayments, but it is on the brink of doing so unless the council gives it more cash.The independent review is less circumspect. It says the company is putting the council at both “budget and reputational risk” and that it “represents an expensive, high-risk delivery mechanism which Exeter City Council cannot afford to continue funding”.It adds: “Currently there is no plausible strategy for the repayment of the loans provided by Exeter City Council to Exeter City Living. Exeter City Living is currently making ever-accumulating losses, while making repayments out of the capital sums loaned to Exeter City Living. Clearly this cannot continue.”  Anthony Road      Site owned by Exeter City Council, previously 13 garages    Three 3-bed houses with B-grade energy ratings    Originally intended for private market sale    Exeter City Living 2018-19 business plan: works to start September 2018, completion May 2019    Council granted planning permission, September 2018    Exeter City Living 2020-21 business plan: works to start December 2019, completion summer 2020    Completed June 2020    Council “stepped in to purchase the properties when Exeter City Living was unable to sell them”    Council bought houses for £900,000 for HRA, July 2020    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: sold to HRA “due to the market disruption and uncertainty with the COVID-19 pandemic”  The independent review covers a lot of ground, but doesn’t get to the bottom of just how long the company has been in this position. Nor does it appear to grasp the significance of the council’s decision to borrow yet more money to underwrite the company’s construction output.In October 2019, Bindu Arjoon, then a senior council director, proposed an £18 million budget to purchase all the flats and houses the company was expected to deliver on development sites at Thornpark Rise, Bovemoors Lane, Hamlin Gardens and Vaughan Road.The council has since increased this budget three times, in March last year then again in February this year and in June too. Its Exeter City Living site purchasing budget now stands at £46.3 million.So the council is borrowing money to loan to the company to build on council land (and buy some of it too) while also borrowing to buy the resulting housing (and sometimes the land) back from the company in turn, financing the company at both ends.  Hockings Green (Thornpark Rise)      Site owned by Exeter City Council, previously 54 garages    Nine 3-bed houses with B-grade energy ratings    Exeter City Living 2018-19 business plan: works to start September 2018, completion December 2019    Council granted planning permission, October 2018    Council allocated £2.6 million HRA budget to purchase completed houses, October 2019    Exeter City Living 2020-21 business plan: works to start December 2019, completion summer 2020    Completed September 2021    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: sold to HRA “due to the pandemic”  The council must avoid the risk of company solvency at all costs – the unfinished sites equate to £41.5 million of its purchasing budget, without including Clifton Hill – but it cannot breach the Prudential Code by giving the company more cash to keep it afloat.The independent review concludes that Exeter City Living should be wound up, but the council wants to stop short of this. It says this is because Karime Hassan and Phil Bialyk decided to set the company up as landlord of six rented flats it acquired at the Guildhall shopping centre when it bought back its leasehold last summer.Were these flats to revert to direct council ownership their tenants could acquire the right to buy them, putting the council’s plans for the Guildhall shopping centre at risk (the centre sits at the heart of a major development site allocated in the new Exeter Local Plan).  Hamlin Gardens development site      Site owned by Exeter City Council, previously car parking    21 flats    Exeter City Living 2018-19 business plan: works to start September 2018, completion December 2019    Council granted planning permission, February 2019    Council allocated £4 million HRA budget to purchase completed flats, October 2019    Council granted revised planning permission, January 2020    Exeter City Living 2020-21 business plan: works to start summer 2020    Council increased HRA budget to £5.3 million, March 2022    Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan: works to start September 2023    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: completion due March 2024    Works now “well under way”  So the council instead intends to acquire all of Exeter City Living’s assets, including the work in progress at Hamlin Gardens and Vaughan Road and the Clifton Hill site (but not the Guildhall flats) by releasing the company from its loan obligations. It then intends to repay all the company’s creditors, leaving the council with the company’s assets as well as its loan liabilities.The council says it will write off the shortfall “in the likely event that the value of the assets to be acquired from Exeter City Living is not sufficient to repay the loan to the council”, but it will not know how large this write-off will be until it has confirmed the value of the Clifton Hill site.It also says it does not expect that the debt will “require the sale of any assets that were not already earmarked for redevelopment”.The remaining Exeter City Living group companies will all be dissolved.  Ernest Johns Mews (Bovemoors Lane)      Site owned by Exeter City Council, previously four flats and a 30 garages    Ten 3-bed houses with B-grade energy ratings    Exeter City Living 2018-19 business plan: works to start February 2019, completion February 2020    Council granted planning permission, October 2018    Council allocated £2.08 million HRA budget to purchase completed houses, October 2019    Exeter City Living 2020-21 business plan: completion due spring 2020    Completed February 2021  The council would like us to focus, in reacting to this news, on what it calls the company’s achievements. The company has completed 22 houses and is constructing 21 flats at Hamlin Gardens and 35 more at Vaughan Road which it says will be finished by the end next year.The council would also like us to accept Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and interest rate rises as major causes of the company’s failure.The Brexit referendum took place in June 2016, three months before the council commissioned its housing development company feasibility study. Brexit isn’t mentioned once in the resulting 250 page company business case, first year business plan, management agreement and company articles. Councillors approved the company’s creation in July 2018, two years later.The UK then left the European Union in January 2020, at the same time as councillors approved its £16 million loan to the company on the basis of a company opportunity paper that confidently said it had mitigated all the risks associated with departure. The council was happy to say a 20% profit was forecast for the development.The COVID-19 pandemic officially became a global health emergency in March 2020. Councillors nevertheless approved the company’s third year business plan in July, four months later, even though the plan laid out an extremely optimistic “upscaling of Exeter City Living’s activities”.It said the company would soon be delivering on thirteen development sites, nine of which it said would be under construction by spring 2022. So confident was the company that it said it might need more money during the financial year if it delivered ahead of schedule.The plan barely acknowledges the pandemic, and none of the councillors who attended the meeting, which was held remotely because of the infection risk, said anything about its potential impact on the company. According to the minutes they didn’t discuss the plan at all.The Russian invasion of Ukraine then began in February last year. The following month councillors approved additional loans of £22.8 million to the company on the basis it would still rapidly grow even though it was immediately clear that the war would have far-reaching consequences.And the Bank of England base interest rate passed 1% on its way to its recent peak in May last year. Six months later councillors saw no reason to make any amendments to the company’s 2022-23 business plan when presented with a mid-year update.They then added £27 million to the council’s Exeter City Living development sites purchasing budget in February and June this year.  Clifton Hill development site      Site owned by Exeter City Council, sold to Exeter City Living    Eleven “affordable” flats and 31 luxury townhouses for private market sale    Previously a sports centre, closed March 2018    Council allocated £150,000 budget for sports centre demolition, June 2018    Council decided to sell whole site for redevelopment including green space, driving range, ski slope and rifle range (but not allotments), June 2018    Council allocated £200,000 budget for ground investigation works and to market and sell site, February 2019    Council leader said decision to sell whole site would be reconsidered after residents’ campaign to save green space led to Independent ward win in local elections, July 2019    Council decided not to sell whole site for development, December 2019    Council agreed £15.64 million loan for company to buy and develop rump site, January 2020    Council agreed to sell rump site to company for £2.14 million, half market value, January 2020    Exeter City Living opportunity paper: works to start summer 2020, completion March 2021    Exeter City Living 2020-21 business plan: works to start autumn 2020    Exeter City Living submitted planning application, June 2020    Council granted planning permission, December 2020    Council presents eleven “affordable” flats as 26% of units vs 35% policy but unpublished internal document confirms flats only 11% of development    Council granted revised planning permission removing affordable housing requirement altogether based on viability assessment valuing land as PBSA, October 2021    Brownfield Land Release Fund award £425,000 of which £200,000 spent, demolition completed autumn 2022    Contractor tendering process failed    Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan: works to start spring 2022, completion spring 2024    Contractor tendering process failed again, January 2023    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: site “currently on hold due to viability constraints following construction cost increases”    Site is only undeveloped land company owns, and is its primary asset  Council officers would also like us to believe that councillors undermined the company’s prospects when the public outcry over plans to sell Northbrook golf course and the whole Clifton Hill site (including all the greenspace behind the sports centre) for development prompted them to change their minds.Bindu Arjoon says both Northbrook and Clifton Hill were “originally identified” by the company as “key sites” when Exeter City Living was established. She also says that the decision not to sell them for development presented an immediate challenge to the company by removing potentially profitable greenfield development opportunities from its pipeline.Apart from the public reaction to the proposed sale of both green spaces being entirely predictable, there is no mention of either in the company business case or first year business plan, which nevertheless lays out the five schemes the company did intend to pursue.In February 2019, nine months after the company was incorporated, then-council leader Pete Edwards confirmed that the Clifton Hill site “had not been approved as part of the current business plan and the cost was likely to be in excess of the devolved financial amounts that they [the company] were able to spend”.He added: “If Exeter City Living wish to bid for the site, they would need to submit a suitable, robust business case to council for consideration.”In December that year the company’s opportunity paper also confirmed that it had considered development there “following the closure of Clifton Hill leisure centre and subsequent council resolutions regarding the sale of the site”.If Exeter City Living needed a £15.64 million loan to buy and develop the rump of the Clifton Hill site, how much might it have needed to borrow from the council to develop the whole site? It would have paid £7 million more for the land, which was valued at £9 million, on which around 200 dwellings were expected, five times as many as the company said it would build on the rump.At a build cost of £320,000 per dwelling, as per its plans for the rump, the purchase and development cost of the whole site would have been around £70 million.Northbrook golf course, at a little over 12 acres, is larger than the whole Clifton Hill site. To finance both developments the council would have had to quadruple its total 2018-19 government borrowing, from £59 million to more than £200 million, and lend all the capital to Exeter City Living, a start-up developer without a track record that needed £150 million to get off the ground.  Vaughan Road development site      Site owned by Exeter City Council, previously twelve council houses and a Devon County Council care home    91 flats, originally one third for private market sale, two thirds HRA    Exeter City Living 2018-19 business plan: works to start June 2019, completion November 2020    Council bought care home for undisclosed sum, late 2019    Council allocated £9.2 million HRA budget to purchase all 91 completed flats, October 2019    Exeter City Living 2020-21 business plan: works to start April 2020, completion March 2022    Council granted planning permission, February 2020    Development contractor withdrew, scheme divided into three phases    Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan: works to start spring 2022, completion autumn 2024    Brownfield Land Release Fund award £795,568, demolition completed April 2022    Council increased HRA budget to £14.2 million for first phase alone, February 2023    Phase one construction began May 2023    Council increased HRA budget to £36.2 million for all three phases, July 2023    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: phase one (35 flats) completion due December 2024, phases two and three (56 flats) subject to viability and council instruction, phase four feasibility study for Rennes Tower (alongside site)  If any of the causes the council claims for the company’s failure presented it with existential risks, why didn’t Karime Hassan, the council’s shareholder representative, or Phil Bialyk, the council leader, or any of the company board members bring them up as they arose?Instead they repeatedly proposed company expansion, and ever-larger loans, despite the company’s consistent failure to deliver on its business plans, or even to deliver business plans at all.And what about other councillors? The company’s affairs have been put in front of them at many meetings in the seven years since it was mooted. Despite numerous opportunities, and prompts, to pause for thought they have repeatedly agreed proposals to spend, in total, more than £100 million supporting the company.So perhaps we should not be surprised that when, just ten weeks after the company’s incorporation was approved, the cap that prevented local authorities borrowing to build new council housing stock was lifted, neither officers nor councillors thought to change course.The independent review says: “It is very important to recognise that within a few months of the establishment of Exeter City Living, a key part of its rationale – development of affordable homes outside of the HRA ring-fence – was no longer a reason for its existence, once the HRA borrowing cap was lifted.”It adds that this disappearance was not “replaced with a compelling justification” for the company’s retention.The borrowing cap removal had looked possible, if not likely, for some time before it happened. Several local authorities had been lobbying the government over the cap since March the previous year, with the government first saying that “innovative” councils could bid to increase their caps, then providing £1 billion extra borrowing capacity for “areas of high affordability pressure” before removing it altogether.The independent reviewers say that some of those they interviewed to gather evidence for their report “were of the view that a pause and review would have been helpful at that time”. Certainly the cost of dissolving the company so soon after its incorporation would have been much lower than the loss with which the council is now faced.  Belle Isle depot development site      Site owned by Exeter City Council, operational depot requires relocation, significant contamination likely    31 high specification flats and houses for private market sale    Council agreed £3.5 million budget in July 2021 for Exeter City Living to relocate depot    Council agreed to sell site for £2.2 million in September 2021 to Exeter City Living    Brownfield Land Release Fund award £673,417 of which £6,254 spent    Brownfield funding criteria not met, 31 March 2024 land sale/works start deadline    Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan: works to start September 2023    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: planning application due    South West Water enforced restrictions preventing use of Exton Road weighbridge as depot relocation site, alternative relocation site not yet identified, September 2023  Four months after the announcement that the cap was being removed, Bindu Arjoon told an Executive committee meeting that “there was no further information required from the government on the implications of the lifting of the HRA borrowing cap”.She then returned to the committee in October 2019, a year after the cap had been lifted, to propose an £18 million budget to purchase (for HRA stock) all the housing Exeter City Living was expected to deliver on its sites at Thornpark Rise, Bovemoors Lane, Hamlin Gardens and Vaughan Road.Her report says the lifting of the HRA borrowing cap presented “a great opportunity” to the council. It also says that “a decision was made to take a step back, in order to look at the opportunities in a holistic and strategic way” after the cap had been lifted, but none of the opportunities that it identifies included reviewing the rationale for Exeter City Living’s existence.The independent review says: “Since the removal of the HRA borrowing cap in October 2018, shortly after Exeter City Living’s establishment, any of these schemes could have been delivered by the council directly, as part of an HRA development programme”.It also says that the company is “not adding value to the delivery of HRA schemes over and above that which could have been achieved through deploying the same resources as part of a directly delivered HRA development programme”.Worse, it found that the council had incurred costs as a result of buying company-built housing that could have been avoided, and that better outcomes could have been achieved had there been “a robust process in place to ensure that the HRA is securing value for money for its investment.”What it did not say, perhaps because it did not grasp its significance, was that from the moment the council decided to finance the company’s sales as well as its production, every penny that the council notionally earned from company interest payments and other contributions simply increased the prices it paid when it bought the company’s houses and flats.  Exeter canal basin development site      Site owned by Exeter City Council, accommodates Exe Water Sports Association and Ride On cycling charity    37 flats on four storeys with ground floor commercial units    Scheme requires vacant possession, “aspirations are for the scheme to retain the Exeter Watersports centre”    Site sale redline includes dry dock space on both sides of canal, crane and mooring points    Brownfield Land Release Fund award £600,000 of which £5,878 spent    Brownfield funding criteria not met, 31 March 2024 land sale/works start deadline    Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan: works to start summer 2023    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: planning application due  The independent review does say that the council’s approach to capitalising the company has been “unorthodox” and that it has been “contravening basic finance principles by borrowing long-term debt to finance day to day operating activity”.It also says the council is “effectively converting an element of debt borrowed by the council into income for the council” (in the form of charges for financial, legal and planning services), a practice it describes as “questionable”.It also criticises the company’s financial management, not least its unrealistic revenue projections, which suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the company’s finances.This is borne out in the company’s insistence that the council benefits from its loan interest payments and developer contributions, when these costs are included in the sale prices the council pays, and from its land purchases, when it buys its sites from the council at less than market value.The independent review also highlights the confusion surrounding the company’s objectives, pointing out that they “have changed on several occasions, without the council taking stock”.It says “critical shifts in the focus of Exeter City Living’s work seem to have taken place without proper consideration by members (over and above approval of the business plan), and without consideration of the tensions between them”, which it says remain “unresolved”.The reviewers also say they heard “concerns about the lack of elected member understanding and engagement with the work of Exeter City Living, particularly in relation to those functions undertaken by the council [chief executive] as shareholder representative.”  Mary Arches Street car park      Site owned by Exeter City Council, includes surface car park    100+ flats for private market rent    Scheme requires vacant possession of North Street flats, CPO may be required    Surface car park requires archaeological dig for Roman remains    Brownfield Land Release Fund award £1,310,000 of which £14,255 spent    Brownfield funding criteria not met, 31 March 2024 land sale/works start deadline    Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan: works to start January 2024    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: at feasibility stage  Notwithstanding these, and other, issues, the independent review places site viability at the heart of the company’s development delivery failures.It says the council and company are insufficiently co-ordinated around a host of challenges ranging from vacant possession, tenant relocation or third party interests that may require compulsory purchase orders, to archaeological and structural issues, planning processes and community opposition to development on specific sites.It says the company makes assumptions about the status of sites while not keeping the council properly informed about its actions, including its bids for government Brownfield Land Release Fund grants, without which most of the sites it intends to develop are not viable.Eight of the company’s development sites have attracted a total of £7.5 million in brownfield grants, ranging from £290,000 to £2.4 million, but only two have so far satisfied the funding condition that either work has to start or the land must be sold to draw down the money.As a result less than £1 million of this money has actually been spent, with funding condition deadlines at the end of March, less than six months from now, on most of the sites. Worse, the council has already spent £55,000 from funding awards for which it has not yet qualified.It is now scrambling to retain the grants by preparing “delivery plans and business cases” for as many of the sites as it can while trying to negotiate deadline extensions.Even if it succeeds, its failure to follow through thus far after being awarded 10% of the national brownfield funding budget risks reputational damage in Whitehall to add to the damage done by its near-breach of the Prudential Code and the failure of the company itself.  Cathedral and Quay car park      Site owned by Exeter City Council, car park has “structural issues”    31 flats for private market sale built on top of multi-storey car park    Scheme likely to obstruct views of the cathedral    Brownfield Land Release Fund award £2,373,183 of which £22,048 spent    Brownfield funding criteria not met, 31 March 2024 land sale/works start deadline    Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan: works to start June 2024    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: not being progressed  As the independent reviewers say, “generating profit in house building is a complex challenge which relies on rigorous cost control (at the level of individual components and packages of works) and a mature sub-contractor supply chain.“Well-established house builders protect their profit margin by micro-managing [various important] aspects of the development process.“We have found elsewhere that other councils have underestimated the challenges of generating cross-subsidy profit and that it is not always possible for councils to exert the same levels of efficiency using the building contractor tender route.”They add that “the barriers for delivery of the remaining pipeline, such as it is, appear at best very high, and quite possibly insurmountable”, and that “there remain multiple high probability and high impact risks, which will be difficult for either Exeter City Council or Exeter City Living to manage”.  Bonhay Meadows development site      Site owned by Exeter City Council, underground flood water tanks    92 flats in two tower blocks    Brownfield Land Release Fund award £1,009,870 of which £6,015 spent    Brownfield funding criteria not met, 31 March 2024 land sale/works start deadline    Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan: works to start summer 2023    Exeter City Living activities and achievements summary: not being progressed  All these viability challenges are as significant now as they were when Exeter City Living was incorporated, notwithstanding company mismanagement, before the HRA cap was lifted and before Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine or interest rate rises began.What might they mean for the council’s Liveable Exeter brownfield site development “vision”?Several of the sites the company failed to bring forward are allocated in the new Exeter Local Plan, which echoes its business plan language around “demonstrating viable delivery of ‘net zero’ housing on brownfield sites”.Exeter City Living enjoys numerous advantages as a development company. It is owned by a council which is happy to finance both its production and sales with long-term publicly-financed loans at fixed interest rates while backing its bids to government for multi-million pound enabling grants. The council, as local planning authority, is willing to override its own affordable housing policy to help the company deliver. And the council, as landowner, is prepared to sell it sites for half their market value without the company having to go to tender.What form would development have to take on these sites to make them viable if a company with all Exeter City Living’s advantages can’t deliver them? What about Clifton Hill? And will Exeter Development Fund fare any better at Southgate when Global City Futures shows its hand?Perhaps the biggest risk presented by these brownfield sites is the impact their viability challenges have on greenfield sites on the edge of Exeter, such as Pendragon Road and Spruce Close, where developers can win much more easily at appeal if housing targets aren’t being met elsewhere in the city.

He did so in consultation with Dave Hodgson and Phil Bialyk, who was in regular contact with company directors.Karime Hassan’s employment at the council was terminated in December, although he stayed in post to the end of March. He has since joined Devon Housing Commission, billed as a “powerful voice to solve Devon’s housing crisis”.Emma Osmundsen, also a council employee, was a company board member as well as company managing director. She also left the council in December, and is now CEO of Sixty Bricks, a council-owned property development company in Waltham Forest.Baan Al-Khafaji and Dave Hodgson were both company board members from September 2020 to November last year alongside their roles as senior council directors. Both were in positions of responsibility at council and company.Bindu Arjoon, now council chief executive, was responsible for proposing that the council should underwrite the company’s sales with an £18 million budget that was subsequently increased to £46.3 million, with council development director Ian Collinson proposing budget increases of £27 million in the past eight months alone.Judging by their demeanour at Tuesday’s Executive meeting during what passed for discussion of the company’s failure, several of the senior officers present would like to believe that they do not share responsibility for what has happened, but can’t quite convince themselves that this is true.The same meeting heard how the council is not only not on track to deliver the £3 million cuts it must make to its budget this year but will have to cut another £5 million from its budget over the next four years. And that’s before factoring in losses related to Exeter City Living.Phil Bialyk with Emma Osmundsen and Karime Hassan at an Exeter City Living PR eventIt is a common fallacy that the arrangements in national government, where MPs make policy and civil servants deliver it, is mirrored in local government.Council officers are in charge at local level. The best most local electors can hope for is councillors who understand that their most important task is to scrutinise the actions and decisions of officers, often while holding down jobs and without the extensive resources afforded to their parliamentary counterparts.This is especially so when the council denies public access to information and decision-making meetings, as it has done on numerous occasions in relation to Exeter City Living.Nevertheless, councillors do have the power to assert control when they see officers leading the council in directions it should not take, should they need to exercise it.Unfortunately, too many Exeter councillors for too many years have found it easier to assimilate inane claims about the city fabricated by senior council officers (and other influential actors) into their rose-tinted vision of who is really running Exeter than to diligently fulfil their roles as guardians of the interests of its residents and businesses.Some city councillors were only recently elected, and so are less culpable than those on whose watch all this took place. Who among those who were in the room all along should take responsibility for the losses Exeter is suffering because of Exeter City Living?"

"content" : "Exeter City Council had submitted a request for a screening opinion in support of plans for up to 200 new flats at Southgate as part of its Liveable Exeter development scheme.The Southgate site, which is allocated for development in the new Exeter Local Plan, includes the Magdalen Street surface car park and the Western Way gyratory that surrounds it.Its boundary has been revised so it no longer includes areas of existing housing or the Cathedral &amp;amp; Quay multi storey car park, the redevelopment of which has been abandoned by Exeter City Living, the council’s development company.Of the resulting site of around four acres, half will be used for residential development of up to 200 flats in tall towers and half for a remodelled highways layout which will replace the existing gyratory with a serious of T-junctions.Southgate development site planAn environmental impact assessment submitted on behalf of the council concludes that the development would not harm the ancient city wall, a section of which is inside the site boundary, or its setting.It also concludes that, while the proposals exceed technical thresholds for scale and size, the site’s existing uses mean that they are not likely to result in significant environmental impact.The council, which is site developer and planning authority, says it will bring forward more detailed proposals for the site in November.It is expected to employ a development financing and delivery model prepared for the site by Global City Futures, Exeter City Futures’ parent company, as part of its Exeter Development Fund project.The project met with strong criticism from opposition councillors at a meeting last year.UPDATEMore detailed proposals for the site were not included on the agenda for the 7 November city council Executive committee meeting as planned, and the council has not said when it expects to bring them forward instead."

It is part of the “East Gate” development zone allocated in the new Exeter Local Plan, which also includes much of Sidwell Street, Paris Street and the foot of Heavitree Road.It faces the north eastern corner of the 734-bed Cheeke Street student accommodation block known as The Depot.It is occupied by several businesses including Yonk Asian Foods, Sai Kung Cafe and the Boneyard retro games arcade. A windscreen repair centre previously also operated there.Summerland Street co-living block redevelopment siteDeveloper Mclaren Property is responsible for 26 student accommodation blocks across the UK.It says its Summerland Street co-living scheme would contribute to “local housing need and the objective of ensuring mixed and balanced communities” and would enhance the St Sidwell’s conservation area.The proposals provide 4.3 square metres of amenity space for each co-living bedspace, including a rooftop terrace that shares the floor with seventeen bedrooms.The building would be two storeys taller than adjacent residential Wheaton House on Red Lion Lane.Comments on the Summerland Street development proposals can be submitted via the city council website where the application can be viewed in full."

"content" : "Members of the Society and College of Radiographers are on strike for 24 hours from 8am today at the Royal Devon NHS Trust alongside colleagues across the country.They are joining consultants and junior doctors, who are holding a combined three day strike which began yesterday at 7am and runs until Thursday morning.This is the first time radiographers, consultants and junior doctors have taken strike action together.The industrial action is part of an ongoing national dispute between the government and health service unions about pay and employment conditions.The strikes are taking place in the final week of a government consultation on its plans to impose new regulations which would allow employers to compel doctors and nurses to work during industrial action under threat of dismissal.The Conservative Party conference is also taking place in Manchester.Dean Rogers of the Society and College of Radiographers said: “Taking strike action is never an easy decision”, adding that radiographers’ pay has been falling behind average wages for many years.He said: “If the government wants to reduce NHS waiting lists and ensure that patients receive the treatment they need, when they need it, then it must urgently prioritise the recruitment and retention of radiography professionals.“But ministers persist in saying that they cannot offer us anything more - after the government failed to offer a solution to the current recruitment and retention crisis. Therefore, we are left with no choice but to take further strike action.”The British Medical Association (BMA), the professional association and trade union that represents UK doctors, has invited ministers to ACAS-facilitated talks in order to resolve the dispute with its members.However the government has previously ignored invitations to use ACAS to broker an agreement and the health secretary has refused to meet BMA representatives for 190 days.

"content" : "Devon County Council has announced that St Thomas library will be forced to relocate from its Church Road home when its lease expires in November after its landlord sought a substantial rent increase at the same time as a longer term.The library had been hoping to renew its lease on the building, which it has occupied for ten years, after Exeter Estates Holdings withdraw its application to demolish and replace it with a block of thirteen flats earlier this year.The company, which is also developing a 60-acre predominantly greenfield site on the edge of Exeter in partnership with Global City Futures, is controlled by Tony Rowe, CEO and chairman of Exeter Chiefs, who has a range of property development interests in and around the city.At the time it claimed that the library planned to relocate but Devon County Council and service provider Libraries Unlimited both said they intended to stay on.St Thomas library in Church RoadRob Hannaford, who is county councillor for Exwick &amp;amp; St Thomas and also a city councillor for St Thomas, said the library is “a hugely successful popular community hub for the whole West Exe area” which “does a huge amount of work to support local families” in addition to providing core library services.He said this extends to include child literacy, public health, employment training and cultural and community events.He added that while the prospect of relocation “could be a good opportunity to move into a more inclusive, bigger space that will allow the library to continue to expand and develop” people would nevertheless fear permanent closure, saying: “We must all work hard together to try and ensure that this does not happen.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.

As the current lease only has two months to run, people are invited to respond by no later than 17 October."

Nor was another deadline of 14 July.At a council meeting last night Labour councillor Emma Morse, who is responsible for development in Exeter, confirmed that the agreement the council signed with developer James Brent earlier this month did not include all the contributions stipulated by its planning committee last year.While £13,500 for local GP surgeries and £22,500 for the Royal Devon NHS Trust has been included in the agreement as intended, a contribution of £85,152 towards school provision has not.As the hotel redevelopment plans do not include any affordable housing, a much larger sum of £2.175 million towards the provision of affordable housing elsewhere in Exeter was also included in the agreement.The remains of the Royal Clarence Hotel in Cathedral YardHowever none of these sums will be finalised until three months after construction is complete, and will not become payable until all 23 planned residential units have been occupied.They will then vary depending on final build costs and profit margins submitted to the council by the developer.At the meeting Emma Morse said the resulting amounts “will depend on how much money is available for healthcare contributions, and if there’s still money left over, affordable housing”.When asked by Green Party councillor Diana Moore when redevelopment work was expected to start, Emma Morse replied that James Brent “had not made it clear”.When asked whether the council would consider using its local planning authority powers to expedite the rebuilding of the hotel, given the uncertainty surrounding it, Emma Morse said she could not commit to anything without talking to council officers, but that her reply was “not a no”.The council allowed three years for development to begin once planning permission was granted, during which time the site may be sold to a new developer with the existing permission attached."

"content" : "The liquidation of Exeter-based shared mobility provider Co-Cars, which ceased trading on 14 July, is expected to leave creditors and shareholders facing losses that total more than £1.3 million.The administrators appointed to oversee the winding-up of the company, which is also responsible for Co-Bikes e-bike hire and the Co-Delivery cargo bike service, have identified more than 400 unsecured creditors which they estimate will lose more than £640,000 in addition to just under 300 shareholders who will lose another £660,000 as a result of the company’s insolvency.In an estimated outcome statement included in a 14 September report to the company’s creditors, the administrators calculate that the company’s assets, cash and debts are likely to be worth a total of just under £160,000, provided the agreed sale of the Co-Bikes fleet and parts proceeds as planned and around £46,000 in outstanding debts are successfully recovered.However they also estimate the total cost of winding up the company at nearly £147,000 leaving just £13,000 available to preferential creditors, including HMRC which is owed around £30,000.This leaves a shortfall to unsecured creditors and shareholders in excess of £1.3 million.Creditors include a Cornwall-based social investment fund which is owed £91,000 as well as around 7,000 Co-Bikes and Co-Cars customers who were collectively £38,000 in credit and/or had unexpired memberships worth £20,000 when the company ceased trading.The company is also in debt for lease termination penalties and repayable grant funding.While many of the company’s shareholders held relatively small numbers of shares, several invested more than £10,000 during a 2020 share issue that offered a 5% target annual interest rate when high street bank deposit rates were below 2%.Empty Co-Cars parking bay in College RoadAdministrators from Taunton law firm Milsted Langdon were initially engaged in early June to seek a purchaser for Co-Cars while it was still trading.Despite contact with over 40 interested parties none wanted to take on either the whole business, or either of its car or bike hire services separately, because of perceived difficulties with the large number of stakeholders that would be involved and the numerous contracts that had been agreed to site car and bike charging points on land owned by third parties.The administrators say they had to investigate the company’s charging equipment installation and use agreements by entering into “discussion with numerous parties about the existence of agreements and what obligations may exist under them” because the company’s records had “proved lacking in detail in this respect”.They also said it had taken “significant effort and the support of a former employee” to locate missing invoices relating to the company’s debts.Co-Bike with Next Bike franchise branding (promotional image)Devon County Council and the University of Exeter were approached by the administrators as the organisations with the most charging site agreements. While both expressed interest in bike hire services continuing, both said they would prefer to start from scratch via new tender processes rather than transfer existing agreements.Plymouth City Council sought to rescue an agreement that had been made to set up electric vehicle hire points in the city, but other car club providers approached by the administrators did not consider the assignable agreement to be commercially viable. As a result a new tender process will also be held for the Plymouth City Council service provision contract.Several parties were interested in the Co-Bikes fleet bikes or the Co-Delivery cargo bikes, or both, but mostly in small quantities. The company had around 240 fleet bikes in varying states of repair, a significant proportion of which were off the road when the company ceased trading.The Co-Bikes franchise agreement with Next Bike, which had required significant investment in bikes and equipment from Co-Cars, provided Next Bike with first refusal on buying the fleet bikes back if Co-Cars defaulted. Next Bike turned them down.Instead, an agreement has been reached to sell all the fleet bikes with the company’s stock of spare parts and uninstalled charging equipment for a little less than £27,000, which is 4.5% of their £600,000 book value. A buyer has yet to be found for the Co-Delivery cargo bikes.Co-Delivery cargo bike in Exeter canal basin (promotional image)The administrators’ account of Co-Cars’ rise and fall says the company was initially profitable, although it adds that “this profit was heavily reliant on the funding that it was receiving from local authorities”.Co-Cars’ turnover grew from £85,000 to £263,000 in the three years to the end of March 2018, although its net surplus in these years initially rose from £9,000 to £22,000 before falling back to just under £3,000.By this time it had 2,000 business and residential customers spread across the South West with the majority of its cars in Exeter but some as far afield as Falmouth and Salisbury. The Co-Bikes network, which had been launched in November 2016, was limited to Exeter.The following year it received more than £315,000 in capital grants and another £125,000 in revenue grants and subsidies and posted a surplus of nearly £250,000.It continued to expand during 2019-20. Escargo Delivery, a start-up supported by the now-defunct Exeter City Futures Exeter Velocities programme, became a Co-Cars subsidiary in September 2019 and rebranded as Co-Delivery.The administrators say the £90,000 deficit Co-Cars posted at the end of that year was a result of investment and expansion, describing the Next Bikes franchise agreement as adding to the “financial burden” Co-Cars faced.The company also changed the way it presented revenue and capital grants in its 2019-20 accounts, with the effect that the previous year’s  £250,000 surplus was restated as a £12,000 deficit.It had by then received more than £500,000 in capital grant funding and was projecting annual income of £1.5 million by 2023-24.Co-Cars and Co-Bikes hub in Ferryman Way (promotional image)The administrators say COVID-19 lockdowns caused “trading problems” for Co-Cars during 2020 which were compounded by the cost of living crisis developing as pandemic pressures eased.After successfully raising £650,000 in shareholder investment between February and August Co-Cars nevertheless reported a loss of £260,000  in 2020-21.Its annual return for that year says it had made “significant investments in new cars and bikes” alongside increasing its workforce to 26 employees, which it said would place the company in a “strong position to meet post-pandemic operational requirements”.It added that its board was “confident that such growth will come once more cars and bikes are added to their respective fleets”.However Co-Cars’ problems “persisted throughout 2022”, as the administrators put it, while the board looked at recovery options including “entering into talks with its financiers and stakeholders”.Despite 2021-22 turnover of £490,000, more than double the previous year, and revenue and capital grants of £335,000, the board reported a further loss of £350,000 that year. It then found it could raise neither further finance nor shareholder funding.Empty Co-Bikes stand in College RoadIts 2021-22 annual return says its growth had not met expectations after global supply chain issues had restricted the expansion and renewal of its car and bike fleets, leading in particular to a fall in the number of viable bikes the company could deploy.It also said further “significant investments” in new bikes it had been able to make, alongside increasing its workforce to 30 staff, had not been matched by the revenue increase it had expected.When it submitted the return, in September last year, the board estimated that a “reasonable proportion” of £2.9 million in private property development and local government contract opportunities it had identified would provide up-front cash payments that would maintain business viability as it moved towards break-even.At the same time it expected revenues to grow as car and bike hire points were established in new locations, as planned.The company auditors, however, reported a material uncertainty regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.

By May this year Co-Cars’ cashflow position was deteriorating and it had “exhausted all possible options”, according to the administrators. While purchasers were being sought it became unable to meet all its costs before finally ceasing to trade on 14 July.It said the suspension of its services for long periods during the pandemic, changes in travel habits and the cost of living crisis had combined with high fuel and energy costs and supply chain issues to force the company into administration.The administrators are now expected to proceed with their liquidation proposals."

These included the adverse impact of its scale, mass and siting, the insufficient residential amenity space it provided, the harm it would do to the surrounding area and the loss of 26 trees on the site.The appeal will be heard by a planning inspector in due course. Interested party comments are due by 13 October and evidence submissions by 14 November, after which an inquiry will be held."

NHS advice is to attend planned appointments during the strikes as normal unless you have been informed otherwise, and to refrain from calling to confirm your appointment is taking place.Dr Nigel Acheson, Chief Medical Officer for NHS Devon, said: “Teams across the NHS in Devon are doing their best to prepare for the upcoming industrial action but these strikes are set to be the most difficult yet in terms of impact on the day-to-day running of our services and on patients.He added: “People suffering a life-threatening emergency should not hesitate to contact 999 or attend one of our emergency departments.“However, I ask everyone else to carefully consider which service could help them best during the strike periods. 111 online is available for advice and your own GP or local pharmacy will be able to provide a range of other care.”"

Our team works so hard helping those members of our community who have nowhere else to turn so we very much hope that local people will vote for St Petrock’s so we can continue to change people’s lives for the better.“Being shortlisted is a wonderful recognition for the support our outreach team provides. However, to win the title of National Lottery Project of the Year would be a wonderful accolade and would undoubtedly help us with fundraising, so we can continue to provide important services at a time when very sadly, the number of people in desperate circumstances continues to rise.”The public vote is open until noon on 9 October. Votes can also be cast by using the hashtag #NLAStPetrocks on Twitter."

The programme was originally launched in 2013 under the Integrated Care Exeter partnership before a £1.5 million government grant enabled its expansion to cover several GP practices across the city in 2015.County council funding for the programme was subsequently provided through its adult social care budget, with the aim that the programme would identify future sources of ongoing financial support.The city council took over programme management in 2017, with Devon County Council contributing £395,000 each year to its running costs from 2018 to 2022.The county council funding contribution was reduced to £270,000 this financial year following withdrawal of government funding for social prescribing projects.It will now cease at the end of this month, six months into the financial year, meaning that the county council’s 2023-24 contribution will halve to £135,000.The city council is hoping to attract philanthropic investors to continue the programme in a new organisational form."

"content" : "Plans to redevelop Exeland House and its car park in Tudor Street to provide 38 “co-living” rooms have been revised in response to Environment Agency objections to the design.A flood risk assessment submitted with the original application for planning permission relied on data from January 2021 instead of 2022 Exeter flood model projections.The Environment Agency said the newer model “represents an extreme increase in flood risks” which would mean a “substantial redesign of the ground floors is likely to be required”.In a follow-up response it added that the River Exe flood defence scheme is “aimed at reducing risk to existing properties and not for facilitating new residential development within the floodplain”.It added that in order to “deal with the future flood risks exacerbated by climate change […] most new residential development will be required to be at first floor or higher in parts of Exeter”, echoing its response to Liveable Exeter development proposals at Haven Banks last year.Revised proposed site planExeland House, which is also known as the old Exe Island Mission Hall, currently provides retail and office space and car parking for thirteen vehicles.It is accessible at ground level and through a portico between two retail units in New Bridge Street which leads to an enclosed flight of stairs down to the hall known as Coffin’s Way.The original plans for the site included a new building connected to Exeland House which provided a gym, office and toilets at basement level and a residents’ co-working space, meeting room, kitchenette and toilet on the ground floor.The revised plans omit the basement altogether and reduce the ground floor in the new building to an entrance lobby, replacing most of the floor with an open undercroft beside the small public piazza that would replace most of the car park.The revised plans otherwise remain the same, thus removing what the application describes as “the main component of the community amenities for the residents” that are supposed to be a key feature of “co-living”.Revised proposed layoutsSeveral of the proposed studio rooms, which include a shower, toilet and galley kitchen, provide less than 16 square metres of space.National space standards require  one-bed one person dwellings to provide a minimum floor area of 37 square metres.The plans also propose three top floor studio rooms intended for occupation by two people. These provide from 26-29 square metres of space, while national standards require a minimum floor area of 50 square metres for two occupants.Full application details are available on the city council website."

"content" : "Exeter’s first “co-living” rooms are being advertised to let at The Gorge, a six storey 133-unit block nearing completion on Gladstone Road, at rents ranging from £1,045 to £1,360 per month.The rents exclude council tax, which is expected to add £120 per month to their cost.Tenant eligibility criteria for the rooms, which range in size from 18 to 26.5 square metres with a shower, toilet and galley kitchen, include an annual income of at least two and half times the rent.This means those wanting to rent the smallest advertised rooms in the block must earn at least £31,350 per annum while an annual income of £40,800 is required to rent the largest.18 square metre “classic” studio room at The Gorge providing less than half the floor area required by national space standards for a one-bed one person dwellingMedian annual earnings for Exeter residents in 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available, were £26,324.Only those earning among the top 20% of Exeter salaries are eligible for the block’s largest rooms – unless they can provide a guarantor who meets the earnings threshold.Stagecoach is currently offering £14.34 per hour to qualified bus drivers with PCV licenses in Exeter. The company says this equates to £28,384 annual earnings with overtime.The starting salary for NHS nurses is £22,383. Their pay does not meet the minimum income requirement for the cheapest advertised rooms at The Gorge until they reach band five with at least four years’ experience.The maximum maintenance loan for the living costs of full-time undergraduates is £9,978.The Gorge being rushed towards completion before the university term beginsThe Gorge is required to offer 27 of its rooms at “affordable” rents to essential local workers. The city council sets these rents at 80% of market rates.Prospective applicants for these rooms are invited to apply for details: their rents have not been published.Priced at 80% of the lowest published room rates, the cheapest would still require applicants to earn at least £25,080 per annum.A band four NHS nurse earning £25,147 would be eligible for such a room, but they would have to spend nearly half their take home pay on rent if they became a tenant.This would leave them living far below the minimum income standard that Joseph Rowntree Foundation says provides an acceptable standard of living for a single adult of working age.There are no restrictions on student tenancies at the development, which is promoted as being just two minutes’ walk from the University of Exeter St Luke’s campus."

"content" : "An application by the Home Office Immigration Enforcement directorate to revoke the premises licence at Belluno, an Italian restaurant in Newton St Cyres, has failed.Two Home Office immigration enforcement officers told a Mid Devon District Council licensing committee hearing on Tuesday that an “intelligence-led” raid on 9 December last year had revealed that the restaurant was employing staff whose immigration status disqualified them from employment in the UK.The Licensing Act 2003 requires that businesses selling alcohol, including restaurants, hold a valid premises licence and that such premises also have a designated supervisor who holds a personal licence.The premises licence at Belluno was held by Kirton Ventures Ltd, the building’s owners, and the designated supervisor was Haqif Derti, who operated through his own company and had day to day control of all aspects of the business.The Home Office application to the council requested the revocation of the premises licence, which is the maximum sanction available under the Licensing Act.It said anything less would be “insufficient to act as a deterrent to the licence holder and other premises licence holders from engaging in criminal activity by employing illegal workers and facilitating disqualified immigrants to work illegally”.Belluno Italian restaurant in Newton St CyresRepetition of this mantra by the immigration enforcement officers at the hearing led to objections from Mr Derti’s solicitor that it was concerned only with the implications for the Belluno licence holders of the circumstances on 9 December, not with general deterrents intended to support government immigration policy.The solicitor’s view was robustly upheld by the licensing committee chair, Tiverton councillor Lance Kennedy, who also prevented the two officers from attempting to introduce new information relating to a previous position held by Mr Derti.There was some disagreement between Mr Derti and the immigration enforcement officers about the detailed findings of the raid, including the content of statements made by the workers which Mr Derti suggested may have been signed under a degree of duress.The licensing committee also heard that another Home Office unit had already issued a penalty of £40,000 against Mr Derti for employing illegal workers which he had not challenged.Mr Derti’s main argument in mitigation was that he had now outsourced the checking of employee immigration credentials to his company accountants.

The licensing committee members concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, illegal working had taken place for which Mr Derti was responsible.The committee revoked his authority to act as a designated premises supervisor with immediate effect and imposed a suspension of the restaurant’s premises licence for one weekend during October on a date of the licensees’ choosing.The restaurant can otherwise remain open but cannot serve alcohol until a new designated premises supervisor is in place. Mr Derti can continue to work there without any licensing responsibility.The details of the decision will be published on the Mid Devon District Council website. The parties have 21 days to appeal."

"content" : "A planning inspector has overturned the city council’s decision to refuse outline permission for a greenfield development of 100 homes on land north of Pendragon Road overlooking the city.The appeal against the council’s decision, which was made in March last year, has only just been decided because of a case backlog at the planning inspectorate.The application to develop adjacent green fields on Exeter’s northern fringe which are not allocated as development sites prompted a major campaign by local residents, spearheaded by ward councillor Naima Allcock.The impact of development on the landscape setting, character and distinctiveness of Exeter’s northern hills, in conflict with current Exeter Local Plan policies, was cited as a key reason for refusal.However the planning inspector’s decision accorded very substantial weight to the provision of 50 new affordable homes, half the total, in the development.It also accorded substantial weight to the provision of the remaining market housing in the context of the council’s inability to demonstrate a five year supply of housing land, determining the supply position as just over four years at the decision date."

"content" : "Exeter City Council has granted outline planning permission for a block of up to nine flats on the same site as it recently refused an application to construct a 26-bed purpose built student accommodation block despite a pending appeal against the previous decision.Developer Sam Williams told last night’s council planning committee meeting that he still aims to build the student accommodation block but was applying to build flats on the site as what he called a “backstop” against the rejection of his appeal.He confirmed that he would not withdraw his appeal were the committee to grant permission for the flats.Howell Road garage covered in graffitiThe committee heard that the day after the council refused his student block application the garage currently occupying the Howell Road site had been covered with graffiti with his permission, an act described as “a child’s dirty protest” by Labour ward councillor Martin Pearce.Liberal Democrat ward councillor Michael Mitchell said that the student block had been refused on community balance grounds, with well over half the residential property in the ward already occupied by students, and that local residents remained concerned that students would also occupy the development if it was built as residential flats instead.He cited local planning powers which enable the city council to impose conditions requiring prospective residents to demonstrate a local connection in new private sector developments and urged the council to adopt these powers, in particular to limit co-living development proposals.Illustrative front elevation of purpose built student accommodation block refused planning permission. Source: Exeter City Council.Robyn Connett, chair of Exeter St James Community Trust, said that local planning policy that is intended to prevent the conversion of residential property in the area to Houses of Multiple Occupation (HMO) does not work as it is not being enforced.The Howell Road flats would become HMOs were they occupied by three or more unrelated people.She added that were the council to approve residential flats on the Howell Road site nothing would prevent the building’s subsequent use as an HMO housing up to 30 students.Illustrative front elevation of residential flats block granted planning permission. Source: Exeter City Council.A council officer said that while the city council had never enforced the policy preventing HMO conversions in St James, it had sought to address unlawful conversions informally.Acknowledging that the credibility of the planning system depends on effective enforcement, he said that the city council had recently employed a planning enforcement officer after many years without one.He added that the council would take enforcement action against unlawful use of the Howell Road development if it went ahead as residential flats but was found in use as an HMO.The planning case officer added that the council would be able to assess future uses of the building via student council tax exemptions, prompting laughter in the public gallery.

"content" : "Plans for a development of 101 studio bedspaces in a complex of three, four and five-storey blocks in the heart of St James have been submitted to the city council for approval.Shopland Gray Developments is seeking full planning permission for a 3,200m2 “co-living” scheme designed by ECE Westworks on a 0.24 hectare (0.59 acre) site in Victoria Street.The development would entail the demolition of an eight-bedroom Victorian villa and the adjacent Lions Holt vehicle repair garage previously occupied by Vanborn &amp;amp; Radford.Three interconnected blocks with raised walkways and paved areas would then be constructed on the site of the garage, house and gardens.Victoria Street co-living proposal development siteA design and access statement describes the scheme as “low rise, medium density housing” in an “exemplar development which enhances the local neighbourhood and improves the existing aesthetic”.It adds that the “modesty of a more suitable design” has driven the development process to a “final design conclusion that respects the locality of the area” in the form of an “individualistic proposal with sensitivity to the surrounding context”.It adds that the development would “positively contribute to the diverse typology of Victoria Street” while “paying homage to the historical vernacular in and around the area”.Victoria Street co-living proposal illustrative view93 of the 101 self-contained studio bedspaces in the scheme, each of which would have its own kitchen and bathroom, would provide a total of 20m2 of living space, about the same as a typical single garage. Three units would provide 21m2, four more 25m2 and one unit 26m2.None would meet national space standards, which require a one-person dwelling to provide at least 37m2 of space (39m2 if it has a bath instead of a shower).Co-living developments are, however, often allowed to evade these standards by local planning authorities which choose to classify them as sui generis, a planning term for uses which are excluded from use classification by legislation.The city council follows this approach. It said it would introduce a co-living policy three years ago, following other local authorities which have adopted planning policies to control such developments, but has yet to do so.Victoria Street co-living proposal illustrations present a panopticon designThe Victoria Street application is nevertheless keen to classify the development site as “redundant brownfield”, a frame it repeats several times.It correctly says the repair garage site, over which the central block would be built, requires further investigation to determine the contamination risks it presents.However it also says that both south and north blocks would be “located on a brownfield area” despite their intended sites on the gardens at the front and rear of Wisteria House.And it says that the “intention is to maintain much of the existing vegetation along the northern and eastern boundaries” but as the plans make clear this will all be cut down inside the site boundary.It then cites the outline draft version of the new Exeter local plan in its support, on the basis that such “brownfield site” proposals are precisely the form of development the city council wants to encourage, and says that council officers support co-living development on the site too.Wisteria House, to be demolished as part of the Victoria Street co-living proposal development siteAn accompanying planning statement says the scheme has been “the subject of extensive consultation prior to it being finalised”.It also says leaflets intended to inform local residents about the proposals were only “posted to the 50 properties in the immediate vicinity of the site” and that the applicants have only engaged with “key stakeholders” other than city council officers twice in more than two years.This apparently amounted to meeting ward councillor Martin Pearce in November last year and holding a video call with Exeter St James Community Trust representatives the following month.In its previous configuration as the St James neighbourhood forum, the trust was responsible for the St James Neighbourhood Plan, which has been in force as part of Exeter’s statutory development plan for more than a decade.The trust’s emphatic opposition to the proposals is clear. It says they are “completely at odds with the community’s vision for a sustainable community and the overarching aim of the neighbourhood plan to restore community balance through planning decisions that tilt away from the current and worsening dominance by one demographic group”.  St James Neighbourhood Plan, policy C2  Large scale purpose built student accommodation will be permitted in areas where it can be properly integrated into the urban area. This means locations:  a) that are not predominantly characterised by intact streets of traditional terraced, semi-detached and detached forms of 2-3 storey residential development;  b) where the servicing and parking requirements could be achieved with no unacceptable impact on the amenity of the adjacent area for residents;  c) where the scale and massing of any purpose built accommodation proposed would be broadly similar to that of surrounding buildings.  Source: St James Neighbourhood PlanThe Victoria Street application does acknowledge the St James Neighbourhood Plan, but it simply asserts compliance with the plan’s provisions and doesn’t mention policy C2, which addresses large scale purpose built student accommodation of the type it proposes.This omission appears to rely on the applicant’s conceit that simply calling the development “co-living” will make it so, even though students would be free to live there and its form is indistinguishable from the purpose built student accommodation to which the policy applies.The design and access statement also includes three site location maps which seek to show that it is in “an ideal location for the proposed use”.These identify several nearby points of interest but not the location of the university’s’ campuses despite both being clearly visible on all three.Victoria Street co-living proposal development site location map with nearby points of interest. Contains satellite imagery © 2022 CNES/Airbus, Getmapping plc, Infoterra Ltd &amp;amp; Bluesky, Maxar Technologies.A design statement “analysis” also seeks to justify the development proposals by comparing them with “precedent examples of co-living in Exeter”.Only one of these schemes is being constructed while work has yet to begin on another despite being approved nearly four years ago then revised two years later.A third has still to be scheduled for determination after falling foul of flood risks.Even though the first Exeter co-living unit has yet to be let, the Victoria Street application says it would “provide a form of housing for which there is a clear and growing need”, saying that co-living is a “much-needed form of development”.It also says that two of the three Exeter co-living schemes will be occupied at a rate between 1.65 and 2 residents per room without explaining why its figures for Victoria Street are based on only one resident renting each studio.“Precedent examples of co-living in Exeter” included in Victoria Street co-living proposalWhile there is no evidence of demand for co-living in Exeter, there is substantial evidence of demand for student accommodation. Students based at the university’s Exeter campuses amounted to nearly 30% of the city’s population in 2021-22.The only Exeter co-living scheme that is actually being built is located opposite the university’s St Luke’s campus, with room rates that are expected to be well out of reach of local workers.We will not know whether its tenants are all students until construction is complete, but few expect any not to be. Public comments on the Victoria Street proposals show that residents anticipate the same outcome in St James.Robert Blakey says the development is “clearly intended as (even more) student accommodation” and adds that the site should instead “obviously be used to provide decent smaller-scale social housing”.Linda Jessep describes the development as “yet more student housing by stealth”, a theme reflected in several responses, while Caroline Lee is also unconvinced, saying: “I do not like being lied to by property developers. Throw this out – it is an absolute sham.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Joseph Fitzpatrick says: “Yet another detrimental planning application with no regard for the local community or the hard work put in to rebuild the sense of community stripped away by historic planning errors.”.Annemarie MacDonald adds: “St James is already under strain and this will only put more pressure on the ward.”As the St James Community Trust points out, Exeter should expect many more student accommodation blocks masquerading as co-living developments like the Victoria Street proposals.The new Community Infrastructure Levy charges being introduced by the city council are designed to encourage this form of development whether they end up occupied by students or not.Exeter City Council is inviting comments on the Victoria Street co-living development plans until 17 September."

"content" : "Charges levied on most new development towards the cost of infrastructure that is needed to mitigate its impact are to change in line with council proposals that discount co-living development to facilitate its delivery.Community Infrastructure Levy charges are used to pay for community grants, habitat impact mitigation and larger projects like Marsh Barton railway station.Of the £10.84 million levy charges committed to significant infrastructure in the nine years to January this year the council spent nearly three-quarters on St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre while another £840,000 was used to reconfigure a road junction at Sandy Park.An independent examination of the new charges proposed by the council, which remained unchanged following a public consultation opened as last year’s Christmas holiday period began, found that they would not threaten local plan delivery and so would provide “an appropriate basis for the collection of the levy in the area”.The council-commissioned assessment that provided the evidence base for the new charges did not consider residential, retail or any forms of development other than purpose built student accommodation, co-living and flats built for rent and sale.The new charges provide discounted rates to enable co-living development in Exeter at one third of the purpose built student accommodation rate despite the two forms being essentially indistinguishable and there being no local viability evidence for the latter.Only one of the two co-living developments that have so far been given planning permission in Exeter is being constructed and is still not complete.The Gorge co-living development under constructionThe scope of the charges examination could not be widened to include other forms of development because of parameters set by the council in advance.These were the outcome of private consultation with just eight organisations including Exeter City Council, Exeter City Living and Exeter City Futures.Council leader Phil Bialyk refused to say, when questioned, who decided not to implement the council’s 2019 decision to commission a complete review of the current charging schedule.He claimed that a partial levy review had been approved, but this is not what council records say.The new Community Infrastructure Levy charges are expected to come into force in January next year."

He has also said it would “exemplify the Liveable Exeter vision and set the benchmark for future development”.In June the council agreed to use its compulsory purchase powers to acquire a block of four flats on the corner of Tan Lane and Water Lane and two nearby strips of land, and to dispose of part of its Exton Road recycling depot, to enable vehicle access to the site.It is expected to propose a Supplementary Planning Document for the site at the beginning of October.This would provide a development framework and design code to inform planning decision-making as detailed applications come forward for the development before the new Exeter Local Plan is adopted. Construction is expected to take at least ten years.Comments on the outline proposals can be submitted via the city council website."

Full story here.EXETER CLIMATE ACTION HUB THREATENED WITH CLOSURE BY CROWN ESTATE AND PRINCESSHAY PARTNERSAgents will not renew lease beyond 15 August or consider other accommodation, claiming all similarly-sized units in half-empty shopping centre are under offer. Full story here.EXETER IN BRIEFDEVON COUNTY COUNCIL has paused its plans to cut a £1.5 million homelessness prevention budget following a campaign led by YMCA Exeter. It intends to reconsider its approach, which prompted widespread criticism from district councils, local charities, homelessness prevention service providers and the public, before making a decision about the future of the funding in December.Climate activists drilled holes in all four of the tyres of more than 60 SUVs parked at a Jaguar dealership in Matford during the early hours of Monday 7 August. TYRE EXTINGUISHERS, an international direct action network which opposes the use of SUVs in towns and cities, later issued a statement saying the destruction was a response to a Land Rover SUV crashing into a school and killing two children on 6 July.The government has confirmed that the HEART OF THE SOUTH WEST LOCAL ENTERPRISE PARTNERSHIP will be wound up alongside the other 35 LEPs that were created in 2011, following the abolition of regional development agencies, to drive regional economic development via infrastructure development and skills training. Its assets and functions are to be transferred to Devon County Council, or a new Devon combined authority should current negotiations result in one, from April next year.GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY plans to shut all its ticket offices by the end of next year, including those at Exeter Central and Exeter St David’s, have received a near-universally hostile reception. Despite belatedly extending a consultation on the closures from three to eight weeks, the company apparently remains unconcerned for the future of in-person ticket sales. Its own figures show that 45% of sales at Barnstaple, 41% at Paignton and 34% at Dawlish  are made this way. At Exeter Central the figure is 18% and at Exeter St David’s 12%, which is still higher than many other major GWR stations including Bristol and Oxford.Councillors are threatening to “empty chair” STAGECOACH SOUTH WEST managing director Peter Knight after his absence from yet another meeting of the committee that oversees Exeter’s highways. Led by Labour’s Martin Pearce, they stressed the importance of a direct link between the bus operator and elected members. A county council officer fanned the flames by explaining that Mr Knight now regularly attends the county’s new bus users and stakeholders forum – which meets in secret – leading councillors to demand wider access to that body in the interests of accountability and transparency. The issue will be referred to the October meeting of the council’s DevonBus Enhanced Partnership Board.DEVON &amp;amp; CORNWALL POLICE chief constable Will Kerr has been suspended by Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez following misconduct allegations eight months after he was appointed to lead the force, which was placed under enhanced inspectorate monitoring by the police inspectorate last year. The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now investigate.A two month public consultation on the draft DEVON, CORNWALL AND ISLES OF SCILLY CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY which will attempt to minimise the impact of climate change on the South West peninsula only received just over 200 responses from the 1.75 million people who live in the region. Publication of a revised, final version of the plan is expected in August before partnership organisations will be invited to endorse it during the autumn, four and a half years after Devon County Council convened the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group to “act now to tackle [the] climate emergency”.Liberal Democrat Tiverton &amp;amp; Honiton MP Richard Foord has announced he will stand against Conservative East Devon MP Simon Jupp in the new HONITON &amp;amp; SIDMOUTH seat at the next general election. Major boundary changes mean both Tiverton &amp;amp; Honiton and East Devon constituencies are being scrapped. A new Exmouth and East Exeter seat is also being created, where David Reed will stand for the Conservatives.Devon County Council has postponed its plans to increase the speed limit along the length of EXWICK ROAD from Redhills to Station Road, and to extend the increase along St Andrew’s Road, after admitting that public consultation responses to its plans had gone missing. The council is justifying the changes, which would also introduce new on-road parking restrictions, on the grounds they would improve road safety and reduce congestion.ON OUR RADARTHURSDAY 10 AUGUST // NORTHERNHAY GARDENSSix multi-instrumentalists tell the story of stranded lovers Hero &amp;amp; Leander through folk and indie songs, choral music and sea shanties.

More details here.ON THE AGENDAThe HEAVITREE AND WHIPTON ACTIVE STREETS scheme trial has begun. The first six months, to 2 February 2024, are a statutory consultation period during which residents and organisations are invited to comment on the scheme. Modal filters and bus gates will initially be employed in five locations with the aim of reducing motor vehicle through traffic and increasing cycling and walking in the area, in which around 17,000 people live. Changes based on consultation responses may be made to the scheme layout during the trial, which will run for up to eighteen months, in which case a further six month statutory consultation would begin.EXETER CITY COUNCIL is inviting comments on its draft digital customer service strategy, which aims to make more efficient use of council resources by increasing its reliance on digital technology for service delivery while continuing to provide personal access for those unable to use it. An online survey runs until 15 September with a printable PDF version that can be posted to the civic centre.Planning permission to rebuild the ROYAL CLARENCE HOTEL as residential flats with ground floor commercial units has still not been granted nearly ten months after the city council approved the plans. An extended 26 May deadline to sign a s106 legal agreement requiring developer contributions to health, education and affordable housing elsewhere in the city was not met. Nor was a further extended deadline of 14 July. Another deadline has now been set for 25 August, six years and ten months after the hotel burnt down.EXETER CHIEFS rugby club has applied for permission to hold six large concerts with up to 15,500 attendees at weekends and an unlimited number of other events with up to 5,000 attendees between May and the third week of July every year. Its application relies on noise and transport impact surveys performed at four trial concerts held in June despite each being attended by well under a quarter of the intended audiences of 15,000.The city council’s decision to refuse an application to demolish a HOWELL ROAD garage to construct a 26-bedroom purpose built student accommodation block on the site is being appealed by the developer, who has recently also applied to build a block of nine flats on the site.Devon County Council is consulting until 14 August on proposals to convert a short stretch of cycle lane in NEW NORTH ROAD alongside John Lewis into a bus and cycle lane to reduce bus journey times. The new bus gate, part of the Devon Bus Service Improvement Plan, would enable around 200 buses a day to avoid travelling via Longbrook Street and York Road to reach the bus station and would also allow them to stop on Sidwell Street.

"content" : "Exeter City Council has approved University of Exeter plans for a six acre 1.07MWp solar farm and electricity substation in Duryard Valley despite acknowledging the harm that will result from the development.Exeter local plan policies L1 and LS1 say that “development which would harm existing or potential opportunities for informal recreation in the valley parks” or “would harm the landscape setting of the city” will not be permitted.However policy EN6 says that “development of renewable energy facilities will be permitted provided that the renewable energy benefits outweigh any harm to the landscape.”Council officers recommended approval of the scheme to last night’s planning committee meeting on the grounds that the “visual and landscape harm and harm to the Duryard Valley Park” that it would cause would be outweighed by the “very substantial” benefits of renewable energy generation.The university owns the publicly-accessible Duryard Valley site, which is a designated a Site of Nature Conservation Importance and is a County Wildlife Site. It says the solar farm will generate up to 3% of the energy it consumes each year.Local plan policy LS4 says that “development that would harm a site of nature conservation importance or a site of local interest for nature conservation […] will only be permitted if the need for the development is sufficient to outweigh nature conservation considerations.”Several city councillors pointed out at the meeting that the university has not yet installed solar panels on the roofs of most of its buildings or on canopies above its extensive car parks.Liberal Democrat Michael Mitchell cited the 1,200-bed East Park development on the other side of the campus as an example, as it was built without any renewable energy generation capacity.Conservative Anne Jobson said she thought that until all the university’s roofs and car parks had been covered with solar panels there could not be a need for development that would cause such harm in direct conflict with local plan policies.Labour’s Martin Pearce (who is not a committee member) added that the development site is a valuable informal space for leisure, recreation and active travel in one of the worst areas in the city for active travel infrastructure.However when it came to the decision his party colleagues on the committee all voted in favour with the Green Party’s Andy Ketchin in support. Four opposition members – Alison Sheridan, Anne Jobson, Carol Bennett and Michael Mitchell – voted against."

"content" : "Exeter Climate Action Hub, a climate crisis information and resource centre that opened in an empty Princesshay shopping centre retail unit last November, is threatened with closure.Agents acting on behalf of landlords the Crown Estate, a UK property portfolio worth around £17 billion which belongs to the British sovereign but is managed by a semi-independent body, and partner Nuveen Real Estate, have told the charity that runs the hub that it has to vacate its premises by 15 August at the end of its lease.While commercial tenancy agreements typically include a clause giving the tenant the right to renew, charity trustee Chris Wood was told it must forego this clause when it agreed the lease.When asked whether the climate action hub could move to another empty Princesshay unit, he was told that all the other similarly-sized spaces were under offer despite four currently being advertised for rent and the Crown Estate’s regional retail brochure showing seven units are available.Exeter Climate Action Hub opening ceremonyFor the past twelve months Exeter Climate Action Hub has provided events, meeting space, film screenings and drop-in advice and support around climate and ecological issues as part of a network of climate emergency centres across the UK.It is integral to Exeter Community Alliance, a collective of nearly 100 local community groups who help support the hub, with some working from and running events there.Exeter Community Alliance organisations are actively engaged in addressing a wide range of social, cultural and environmental issues in the city.They include Exeter Community Energy, Exeter Cycling Campaign, Exeter Library of Things, Recycle Devon, Exeter Respect, the Trans and Non-binary Café, Exeter Communities Together, The Baby Room, Exeter Foodbank, Devon Development Education, Maketank, Refugee Support Devon, the Conversation Café, St Petrock’s and Exeter Observer.Green Futures Network and Exeter Living Lab positive tipping points event at Exeter Climate Action HubThe Crown Estate benefits from the climate action hub’s tenancy as it avoids having to pay business rates on an empty unit, while the charity is able to claim 100% business rates relief as the tenant.Princesshay also benefits by being able to cite the hub as one of its key sustainability initiatives in promoting its “commitment to the environment”, which it says it takes “very seriously” while “working towards becoming even more environmentally conscious”.The Crown Estate, which made a record net profit of nearly £450 million last year, goes further. It says “sustainability is at the heart of our approach” and that it is “committed to aligning our business to the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, with a target to be a net zero business by 2030 and climate positive thereafter.”It has significant interests in renewable energy among other environment-related initiatives, addressing areas that now-king Charles has prominently promoted since the 1970s.Exeter Climate Action Hub in Bedford StreetClimate action hub trustee Chris Wood is writing to the king to seek his assistance. In the meantime, the charity is preparing to vacate its Bedford Street premises by moving the furniture, catering equipment, repair tools, musical instruments, books, computers and display materials it has amassed, mostly from donations, into storage.Maketank, which is 300 metres away in Paris Street, has offered to house many of these things until a new home for the hub is found.Help is needed on Tuesday 8 and Monday 14 August with all aspects of the move. Anyone who can spare some time on either day is invited to email Chris Wood on chris@climateactionhubexeter.net to let him know that they can come along.Anyone who may know of a suitable new home for the hub is also invited to get in touch with Chris at the same address."

They criticised the Labour Party’s failure to adequately respond to repeated calls from young people for rapid decarbonisation, a just transition to a low emissions economy and investment in green jobs, and demanded bolder climate commitments from the party ahead of the next general election.A 48 hour strike by consultants at the ROYAL DEVON NHS TRUST was held from 7am on Thursday 20 July to 7am today.A joint city and county council bid for government funding to replace MALLISON BRIDGE at Exeter Quay, which was closed five years ago before being removed, has failed. Pedestrians and cyclists crossing Cricklepit Bridge are instead expected to continue sharing a narrow alleyway off Commercial Road for the foreseeable future.Devon County Council intends to increase the speed limit along the length of EXWICK ROAD from Redhills to Station Road, and to extend the increase along St Andrew’s Road, despite criticism of its proposals during a public consultation last November. The council is justifying the changes, which would also introduce new on-road parking restrictions, on the grounds they would improve road safety and reduce congestion.The county council has confirmed that it intends to introduce its EXETER LOCAL CYCLING &amp;amp; WALKING INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN, now six years late, without committing to delivery timescales, allocating any funding or expanding the proposed network in response to opposition to its plans centred on their lack of ambition. It also rejected calls to extend a 20mph speed limit across Exeter to increase cyclist and pedestrian safety.Nicola Wheeler, currently Head of Community Programmes at Peabody, will become the new CEO of INEXETER, Exeter’s business improvement district company, in October. The company charges a 1.25% business rates levy on around 750 eligible organisations operating inside defined geographic boundaries which it primarily uses for promotional activities and events.Exeter-based South West shared mobility provider CO CARS, which is also responsible for CO BIKES e-bike hire, ceased trading on 14 July. It says the suspension of its services for long periods during the pandemic, changes in travel habits and the cost of living crisis have combined with high fuel and energy costs and supply chain issues to force the company into administration. Buyers for all or part of the business will now be sought.ON THE AGENDAHEAVITREE AND WHIPTON ACTIVE STREETS scheme exhibitions are being held from 4-7pm on Tuesday 25 July at Park Life Heavitree and on Wednesday 26 July at Whipton Community Hall. The scheme trial will begin in August for up to eighteen months, the first six of which will be a statutory consultation period during which residents and organisations will be invited to comment on the scheme. Four modal filters and three bus gates will initially be employed with the aim of reducing vehicular neighbourhood through traffic and increasing active travel in the area, in which around 17,000 people live. Changes based on consultation responses may be made to the scheme layout during the trial, in which case a further six month statutory consultation begins.Devon County Council is consulting until 14 August on proposals to convert a short stretch of cycle lane in NEW NORTH ROAD alongside John Lewis into a bus and cycle lane to reduce bus journey times. The new bus gate, part of the Devon Bus Service Improvement Plan, would enable around 200 buses a day to avoid travelling via Longbrook Street and York Road to reach the bus station and would also allow them to stop on Sidwell Street.Another application to convert outbuildings and a garage to a three-bedroom house at Fernleigh Nurseries in the heart of LUDWELL VALLEY PARK has been submitted to the city council despite similar previous applications being twice rejected and dismissed at appeal.A contractor has applied on behalf of the city council for permission to rebuild and reinforce a section of ANCIENT CITY WALL on Bartholomew Street East beside the City Gate Hotel that collapsed in 2019.Devon County Council is holding a second consultation until 26 July on proposals it says will “improve facilities for active travel” in ALPHINGTON VILLAGE between the Alphin Brook roundabout and the double mini roundabout at the Shillingford Road turn. It follows another consultation that ended in January last year on similar “enhancements” which it claims will mitigate the impact of traffic from 2,500 new homes planned as part of the South West Exeter extension.

"content" : "Devon County Council has been funding adult homelessness prevention services for nearly ten years. It says they are intended to help people “whose homelessness is not just a housing issue, but something that is inextricably linked with complex and chaotic life experiences, that can lead to disproportionately poor health and well-being, high levels of health and social care need and cost, and premature mortality.”The services are aimed at achieving lasting recovery for people escaping from traumatic events and homeless situations, including rough sleeping, by supporting them in temporary accommodation until they are ready to move on into independent living.The county council’s annual £1,455,000 contribution to the cost of delivering these services currently enables five local charitable, non-profit organisations to support around 250 people at any one time. While the funding does not pay for accommodation directly, it is aligned to accommodation provision, paying for support hours delivered in managed multiple occupancy hostel settings as well as via a countywide floating service.150 households currently receive this support in Exeter, while nearly two-thirds of the floating support is targeted here.Devon County Council, Exeter City Council and East Devon District Council agree on the rising complexity of adult social care needs, in particular in younger adults, and the increasing levels of support needed to meet these needs year on year. East Devon District Council says this makes “resolving their homeless situation even more challenging, against a backdrop of extremely limited resources, in particular supported accommodation and support services”.Exeter City Council says there were 224 rough sleepers in the city last year – the most ever recorded – while the number of single homeless people approaching it for housing support increased by nearly a third to 753.Until now there has been also been agreement that the homelessness prevention approach followed in the city works. A recent government-funded report concluded that this form of intervention is “effective, both in human terms, and for the public purse” with “positive cost to outcome benefit ratios” involving “relatively small amounts of council investment” that “can lead to significant benefits”.It also found that “projects offering wrap-around services as well as housing support, and with a person-centred approach, can be particularly effective”.

East Devon District Council and Teignbridge District Council can also refer to Gabriel House and YMCA Exeter.However in January the county council announced that it intended to make £50 million of unspecified spending cuts in its £696 million 2023-24 budget. Its finance director Angie Sinclair described its approach, which involved increasing spending in some areas while reducing it in others, as a “re-prioritisation”.Then, a week after passing its budget in February, it said that it planned to cut the funding of five adult social care services, including the £1.5 million adult homelessness prevention service contract. According to its own budget impact assessment there is a “very substantial risk that if the preventative work of many VCSE [Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise] organisations ceases the burden on frontline statutory services will increase even more”.A county council adult social care report warned three days later that the “public sector needs to be aware that VCSE cannot continue to mitigate their service reductions”. It also admitted that increased street homelessness and rough sleeping, job losses and adverse impacts health and well-being, including “risk to life” and “exploitation” were probable consequences of its planned cuts.Others went further. Peter Stephenson of St Petrock’s, Fiona Carden of CoLab Exeter, Penny Blackmore of EDP Drug and Alcohol Services and Si Johns of YMCA Exeter said, in a joint letter to Devon’s MPs, that the cuts would cause an “inevitable and significant increase in homelessness and rough sleeping” across the county.They added that as “the vast majority of those who will be affected” face “multiple health and social inequalities including poor mental and physical health, and substance addictions” there would “inevitably be a major impact on other Devon County Council budgets”.Shelter’s Stuart Francis-Dubois said the cuts could have “potentially tragic consequences”, adding: “We know that many young people using these services are on the edge and that the services deal with suicide attempts on a regular basis.“Without these services it is likely that some young people will take their own lives as a direct result of the proposed changes.”Rough sleeper sheltering at Exeter GuildhallEast Devon District Council said the cuts would have “a devastating effect”, putting the “established and effective supported accommodation model that has been set up to successfully assist people with a recognised support need at great risk” and undermining and disrupting the “significant amount of work that has gone into tackling rough sleeping over a number of years”.It added that the “already high and escalating numbers of people in homeless and rough sleeping situations would increase significantly further”, increasing the need for “hospital admissions, GP and hospital appointments, mental health service support, police and probation assistance and interventions”.Exeter City Council said it was “likely that the accommodation projects will shrink or close” as a consequence of the cuts, resulting in “up to 84 households becoming homeless and needing crisis intervention” in Exeter alone, leading not only to increased levels of rough sleeping but also forcing more young people into homelessness.A report produced on behalf of Devon’s district councils found that “in Exeter and Teignbridge alone the complete withdrawal of this support contract is likely to result in an annual minimum cost to housing alone of £2 million”.There has also been extensive criticism of the county council’s cuts impact assessment, including the inaccuracy of many of its claims and assumptions and the fact that, as the county council has not undertaken any service delivery monitoring for five years, it lacked the data necessary for proper evaluation and to ensure its Public Sector Equality Duty obligations would be met. The city council described it as “uninformed”.Perhaps most strikingly of all, the county council failed to notify any of the service providers or the county’s other local authorities that it planned to axe the funding before publicly announcing its plans. The service providers were told their contracts were being terminated on the same day as the public consultation on the cuts began, 22 February.YMCA Exeter public consultation responses summary932 responses had been submitted by the time the consultation closed on 19 April. Not one supported the cuts. We know this not because the county council promptly published a summary, but because Si Johns of YMCA Exeter used freedom of information legislation to compel the county council to release the consultation responses.There was near-universal condemnation of the county council’s plans. Local councillors from across the political spectrum, support service users and providers, national homelessness charities and policy research organisations all urged a rethink.One local council leader said the cuts made “little financial or practical sense” and seemed to be a “short term financial fix which can only lead to problems of much greater scale in the future, all the while imperilling our mutual efforts to protect the most vulnerable in society.”Councils and councillors from across Devon’s districts made direct representations to County Hall, and raised objections at Health and Adult Care scrutiny committee meetings in March and June. They exhorted the county council to pause the cuts to gather accurate information on their impact, including their wider costs, and at least to ensure that alternative provisions were put in place.All to no avail. As James McInnes, the county councillor who is responsible for adult social care, made clear at last week’s cabinet meeting, the county council has no intention of changing the spending decisions it made at the beginning of February when it set its 2023-24 budget.  YMCA Exeter case study  YMCA Exeter receives £157,167 in homelessness prevention services funding from Devon County Council each year.  This money contributes to the cost of the charity supporting 85 vulnerable young people in temporary accommodation, at a rate of £1,850 per annum each, to whom it provides tailored care as they come out of homelessness or care and establish themselves.  This care includes a 24/7 support service, training programmes, activities, employment advice, support with emotional and physical well-being, money advice and managing debt.  The cost of a standard adult social care package is £10,880 per annum, so the cost to Devon County Council of providing this support directly to 85 young people would be £925,000 each year.  And this excludes the cost of accommodation, which the YMCA can provide under special exemption rules. The cost of housing benefit at Local Housing Allowance rates in the private sector for the 85 young people living under YMCA roofs would be a minimum of another £877,000 each year, and would fall on Exeter City Council.  How does YMCA Exeter provide so much with so little funding? It actually spends close to £1 million each year on the 85 young people who receive its support. It can do this by leveraging the county council contribution to its homelessness prevention services provision to raise match-funding, grants and donations in a way local authorities cannot. It can organise fundraising campaigns that can multiply the value of modest local authority contributions.  As joint CEO Si Johns says: “Charities and the voluntary sector are the key to saving statutory funding”, not least because they intervene before local councils are compelled to step in by their statutory obligations.  As he says, cutting homelessness prevention is a false economy.He said the county council’s statutory responsibility to improve health and reduce health inequalities has nothing to do with it, despite its own impact assessment admitting that “the cohort of individuals supported by this contract have the poorest health and well-being within the county”.He appeared indifferent to the staff redundancies, loss of skills and evictions of more than a hundred vulnerable people that the cuts would entail, saying that the service provision contract term and conditions entitle the council to terminate it without further notice.He said that the consultation had enabled the county council to “listen to people’s views” which he said would be “given due regard before final proposals are developed and presented to cabinet for decision”, adding that “people with eligible needs” would continue to have them met “in ways that are improved from a best value perspective”. By this he apparently meant the county council’s perspective, provided it no longer spent any money on their support.When asked to explain how the county council would meet the increased costs that would result from the cuts, for which it would be responsible under its statutory obligations, as it had apparently not accounted for them in its budget, he said the county council does “not see eligibility [for adult social care services] as a financial burden”.He added: “Through our vision and strategies, we have set out our approach to how we will support people, in the first instance in a strength based and short-term way that promotes their independence and if possible without the need for commissioned and on-going statutory funded services.” In other words, there wouldn’t be any cost increases as the county council had no intention of spending any money on support services either way.YMCA Exeter stop the funding cuts campaign imageThe county council’s Health &amp;amp; Adult Care scrutiny committee is now due to meet next Thursday, supposedly so county councillors can examine what adult social care director Tandra Forster claims are “developing” recommendations, before cabinet confirms the cuts in a month’s time. Her report to the committee doubles down on James McInnes’ evasions.It says the county council has “worked hard to understand the impact of its proposals” and has “engaged with those potentially impacted, including all district and city authorities across Devon”. It nevertheless entirely omits the up to date financial, service performance and impact information supplied by those authorities and the service providers to the consultation in its responses summary.It says: “the council is committed to supporting the prevention of homelessness”, adding that “the ending of our contribution to the fund will not mean that people will now have unmet adult social care needs”. However it also says it “will exercise its duties to ensure those who need an assessment under the Care Act receive one, and to consider how care and support needs can be met, if identified”, revealing its hand.It even manages to claim that other county councils “do not directly contribute funding in this area” while also mentioning “those who do”.It then presents an “options appraisal” in which all options simply refer to the same financial considerations, which are that its 2023-24 budget does not include funding for any option other than a full cut, and says the consultation “has informed a refreshed equalities impact assessment, analysis of options and recommendation to cabinet”, as if its position has changed since January.

Which is odd, as James McInnes said it had already been updated before the July cabinet meeting.It also said the scrutiny committee would have to make do with the impact assessment it produced before the consultation took place.Is there any chance the county council will change course? The determination to cut homelessness prevention funding it has demonstrated over the past six months, and its apparent willingness to compromise its integrity to get its way, suggests not, however unanimous the opposition to its plans and however wasteful they may be."

"content" : "You don’t have to wait long at a High Street bus stop before someone will pass comment on the state of Exeter’s bus services, with Stagecoach South West, the area’s principal bus operator, cast as chief villain.The reality is more complex. The key factors influencing the quality of service we experience on our streets are well beyond the reach of Stagecoach, or any other bus operator. Local authorities, central government, the state of the economy, the structure of the bus industry, and passengers – actual and potential – all contribute to the operating environment.Peter Knight took over as managing director of Stagecoach South West in December last year. We recently spoke with him about his plans to steer Exeter’s bus services around these obstacles.Exeter bus stuck in rush hour trafficMr Knight is clear about the way forward. He wants his customers to experience a bus service which turns up when the timetable says it will, offers a range of good value-for-money fares and gets people from A to B safely and reliably. He sees three principal challenges in achieving these objectives: road traffic congestion, operational costs and post-COVID passenger levels.Congestion is a frequent problem on Exeter’s road network, and buses contribute to congestion as well as fall victim to it. Mr Knight says that one justification for bus timetable changes that were introduced in April was to give individual buses more time to complete their journeys, rather than become increasingly delayed by congestion, even to the point that timetabled trips are curtailed.He cites Stagecoach figures comparing a 1% punctuality improvement in the city over the past twelve months with a 10% improvement since the April timetable changes (though buses that are up to five minutes late still count as “on time”).However there is only so much a bus operator can do to address congestion, as he points out. Other solutions require changes on the highway network itself, such as priority for buses at junctions or new bus lanes. These are the responsibility of the local highway authority, Devon County Council.“Keeping the traffic flowing” used to be the mantra of highway authorities, and still is one of National Highways’ objectives. However local authority priorities are now more about keeping traffic in its place by managing the roads network or creating new infrastructure so people, rather than cars, are the priority.Exeter bus stuck in trafficA focus on improving bus services was one of the more useful initiatives of Boris Johnson’s government, in the form of the Bus Back Better strategy. Mr Knight is enthusiastic about the DevonBus Enhanced Partnership arrangements it introduced alongside Devon’s Bus Services Improvement Plan.Although it is still early days for these arrangements, he sees the key players coming together as the Enhanced Partnership Board to talk to each other round a single table and share data as an important initiative. It has already led to the identification of some low-cost interventions in traffic management that should help buses keep moving, though he notes that “these things do take time”.Devon County Council’s 2020-2030 Exeter Transport Strategy is accompanied by a 5-year implementation plan which lists the identification and reduction of bus delays at congestion hotspots as a key action. Mr Knight told us that the Enhanced Partnership Board has so far done some work on identifying these hotspots. Beyond that, we await implementation.At the same time some schemes, principally bus lane improvements, were approved for funding from the £8.8 million allocated by the government for the capital spending element of Devon’s Bus Services Improvement Plan, though this sum covers the whole county, not just Exeter. According to Devon County Council, bus priority improvement schemes for New North Road and Cowick Street have been finalised and are ready for public consultation.There is no sign of more radical measures to deflect traffic from Exeter. Congestion is not just a city centre phenomenon but affects all the main routes in and out of the centre to varying degrees. And opening the occasional new rail station such as Marsh Barton is not going to create the step change in travel habits needed to address it.Parking (legally) in a bus lane slows down bus journeysThe second challenge for Stagecoach in achieving bus service improvements is operational costs, which Mr Knight says have increased by 30% since the pandemic. He stresses that the company tries to absorb as much of these increases as it can, though as bus users can testify this still doesn’t prevent fare rises.Operational costs include vehicle parts, tyres, fuel and oil. They also include staff salaries, which have been increased to ensure the company can attract employees in a competitive marketplace. It has achieved a net increase of eighteen drivers over the past year and the driver shortage – a key factor in Stagecoach being summoned before the Traffic Commissioner in November last year – has now eased.The company’s “operated miles” figure (the miles run as a proportion of those scheduled) was 99.2% for Exeter in early May, up from a nadir of 93%. (Devon County Council says it was 99.5% in early June.) Mr Knight attributes the miles that are still being lost to breakdowns and congestion-related cancellations rather than a shortage of drivers.The company’s third challenge is changes in the ways people use buses in the post-pandemic world. Passenger numbers fell nationally to 10% of pre-pandemic levels in April 2020 before returning slowly to around 90% of their former levels by May 2023.Mr Knight’s analysis is that people travel into cities less frequently to work as the attractions of flexible working have become apparent and make fewer shopping trips because of online retailing. Trips by concessionary card holders are at around three-quarters of pre-pandemic levels, which is significant for bus operators in Devon with its relatively elderly population.Bus maintenance costs have risen significantlySome argue that service frequencies should be increased to make buses a more attractive mobility choice. Mr Knight is cautious. As he puts it, as soon as the door shuts and there is nobody on the bus the operator has no income to set against its running costs, some £50 per hour.He didn’t list improving passenger information systems – which continue to be unsatisfactory – in his three key challenges. He told us he believes the situation has already improved, though he acknowledges the company could be better at communicating unforeseen issues in real time.The app remains unreliable and advance notice of route changes is often not provided. Despite re-routing the Green Park &amp;amp; Ride service from early this month to serve the new Marsh Barton rail station there appears to be no mention of this on the company’s website. Stagecoach could and should fix such issues.If we want modal shift away from private car use – as endorsed by all the relevant city and county council policies – buses are the only realistic alternative for journeys that cannot be made by rail or are too long or difficult to walk or cycle. Yet the business model we have for bus services requires operators to make a profit, except on a small number of subsidised routes.Short notice cancellations remain an issueWe asked others what they thought of Stagecoach’s performance in Exeter. Devon County Council said it was “on the whole very good”, while pointing out that some services could benefit from frequency increases.The Exeter &amp;amp; District Bus User Group shares the county council’s view that reliability is much improved, but would like to see better timetable planning on routes where services are bunched together, leaving long gaps between buses. The group meets regularly with senior Stagecoach managers and the county council’s bus services officer. It was told that the government’s £2 maximum fare initiative had helped to increase passenger numbers by around 5%-6%.City council leader Phil Bialyk told a June council scrutiny meeting that some Exeter bus routes had “the worst provision of service on timetabling” he had encountered. He announced that Mr Knight had agreed to hold a briefing for all city councillors on the issues facing the company.As for the travelling public, the evidence is anecdotal. Waiting at a stop or sitting on a bus provides ample opportunity to hear unsolicited complaints. There is also an Exeter Area Bus Action Group on Facebook that reflects a range of views, some of which seem representative of common problems.One member recently asked: “Anyone know if the R/S is running today? 9.21am bus from South Lawn Terrace to town never arrived and the lady waiting before me said the earlier bus didn’t arrive either.” They added: “I’ve now had to spend money on a taxi to get into town on time for my appointment. No sign on bus stop or app of any cancellations or disruptions”.Later the same day they followed up: “Spoke to Stagecoach about the lack of information, apparently they are not liable for informing their customers about changes to routes in terms of diversions or road works (absolutely ridiculous!).“When I asked about a refund for the extra money I had to spend on a taxi they offered a free day rider ticket or said speak to the local council or MP – what a joke”.Exeter bus stuck in trafficIn the end, running reliable and affordable bus services comes down to political will and money. Central government has been reducing local authority spending power for more than a decade, severely constraining the ability of transport authorities to subsidise unprofitable services and highway authorities to do more than maintenance.And the £5.2 million in government funding for the revenue spending element of the Devon Bus Services Improvement Plan – substantially less than the £102 million asked for – cannot be used to maintain existing facilities or support existing bus services.In most parts of England bus services are provided by private companies that seek to make a profit and are reluctant to carry risk. Accounts published by Stagecoach Devon Limited (the legal name for Stagecoach South West) show that the company increased its revenue by 26% between 2020-21 and 2021-22, from £37.8 million to £47.8 million.At the same time it turned an operating profit of £1.9 million for 2020-21 into a loss of £0.9 million in 2021-22, down 150%. This significantly underperforms Stagecoach’s UK regional bus sector as a whole, where revenues were up 35% and profits 136% over the same period.Unless the local transport authority can subsidise unprofitable services then the market will determine where buses run, not social or environmental need. Government policy continues to support this approach. Since implementation of the Transport Act 1985, public regulation of bus service provision outside of London has been minimal.In Exeter, council leader Phil Bialyk does not consider renationalisation of buses a realistic or even desirable prospect. He told the June meeting that the costs of the council purchasing and operating buses would be excessive, and said he would instead prefer an approach which gives councils and the public a major say over what services are provided. Transport for Cornwall could be a suitable model.Meanwhile Peter Knight says that Stagecoach is “working around the clock to ensure that everything is as it should be”. There’s no reason to doubt this, but the obstacles the company has to find its way around are formidable."

"content" : "Planning permission to rebuild the ROYAL CLARENCE HOTEL as residential flats with ground floor commercial units has still not been granted nearly ten months after the city council approved the plans. An extended 26 May deadline to sign a s106 legal agreement requiring developer contributions to health, education and affordable housing elsewhere in the city was not met. Nor was a further extended deadline of 14 July. Another deadline has now been set for 25 August, six years and ten months after the hotel burnt down.GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY plans to shut all its ticket offices by the end of next year, including those at Exeter Central and Exeter St David’s, have received a near-universally hostile reception. Despite belatedly extending a consultation on the closures from three to eight weeks, the company apparently remains unconcerned for the future of in-person ticket sales. Its own figures show that 45% of sales at Barnstaple, 41% at Paignton and 34% at Dawlish  are made this way. At Exeter Central the figure is 18% and at Exeter St David’s 12%, which is still higher than many other major GWR stations including Bristol and Oxford.Councillors are threatening to “empty chair” STAGECOACH SOUTH WEST managing director Peter Knight after his absence from yet another meeting of the committee that oversees Exeter’s highways. Led by Labour’s Martin Pearce, they stressed the importance of a direct link between the bus operator and elected members. A county council officer fanned the flames by explaining that Mr Knight now regularly attends the county’s new bus users and stakeholders forum – which meets in secret – leading councillors to demand wider access to that body in the interests of accountability and transparency. The issue will be referred to the October meeting of the council’s DevonBus Enhanced Partnership Board.EXETER CHIEFS rugby club has applied for permission to hold six large concerts with up to 15,500 attendees at weekends and an unlimited number of other events with up to 5,000 attendees between May and the third week of July every year. Its application relies on noise and transport impact surveys performed at four trial concerts held in June despite each being attended by well under a quarter of the intended audiences of 15,000.DEVON &amp;amp; CORNWALL POLICE chief constable Will Kerr has been suspended by Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez following misconduct allegations eight months after he was appointed to lead the force, which was placed under enhanced inspectorate monitoring by the police inspectorate last year. The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now investigate.The city council is expected to grant the UNIVERSITY OF EXETER planning permission for a six acre 1.07MWp solar farm and substation on publicly-accessible greenspace in Duryard Valley Park despite its visual and landscape harm at the 31 July meeting of its planning committee. The university owns the development site, which is a designated a Site of Nature Conservation Importance and County Wildlife Site.The city council’s decision to refuse an application to demolish a HOWELL ROAD garage to construct a 26-bedroom purpose built student accommodation block on the site is being appealed by the developer, who has recently also applied to build a block of nine flats on the site.A two month public consultation on the draft DEVON, CORNWALL AND ISLES OF SCILLY CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY which will attempt to minimise the impact of climate change on the South West peninsula only received just over 200 responses from the 1.75 million people who live in the region. Publication of a revised, final version of the plan is expected in August before partnership organisations will be invited to endorse it during the autumn, four and a half years after Devon County Council convened the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group to “act now to tackle [the] climate emergency”.Liberal Democrat Tiverton &amp;amp; Honiton MP Richard Foord has announced he will stand against Conservative East Devon MP Simon Jupp in the new HONITON &amp;amp; SIDMOUTH seat at the next general election. Major boundary changes mean both Tiverton &amp;amp; Honiton and East Devon constituencies are being scrapped. A new Exmouth and East Exeter seat is also being created, where David Reed will stand for the Conservatives.Devon County Council has postponed its plans to increase the speed limit along the length of EXWICK ROAD from Redhills to Station Road, and to extend the increase along St Andrew’s Road, after admitting that public consultation responses to its plans had gone missing. The council is justifying the changes, which would also introduce new on-road parking restrictions, on the grounds they would improve road safety and reduce congestion.Climate activists staged the first of what they say will be weekly protests outside the Clifton Hill constituency office of EXETER MP BEN BRADSHAW on 21 July. They criticised the Labour Party’s failure to adequately respond to repeated calls from young people for rapid decarbonisation, a just transition to a low emissions economy and investment in green jobs, and demanded bolder climate commitments from the party ahead of the next general election.A 48 hour strike by consultants at the ROYAL DEVON NHS TRUST is being held from 7am on Thursday 20 July. Planned care work will be affected, with service reduced to “Christmas day” levels. NHS advice is to attend planned appointments as normal unless you have been informed otherwise. Emergency and urgent, critical, neonatal, maternity and trauma care remain available throughout the strike.A joint city and county council bid for government funding to replace MALLISON BRIDGE at Exeter Quay, which was closed five years ago before being removed, has failed. Pedestrians and cyclists crossing Cricklepit Bridge are instead expected to continue sharing a narrow alleyway off Commercial Road for the foreseeable future. The county council has confirmed that it intends to introduce its EXETER LOCAL CYCLING &amp;amp; WALKING INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN, now six years late, without committing to delivery timescales, allocating any funding or expanding the proposed network in response to opposition to its plans centred on their lack of ambition. It also rejected calls to extend a 20mph speed limit across Exeter to increase cyclist and pedestrian safety.HEAVITREE AND WHIPTON ACTIVE STREETS scheme exhibitions are being held from 4-7pm on Tuesday 25 July at Park Life Heavitree and on Wednesday 26 July at Whipton Community Hall. The scheme trial will begin in August for up to eighteen months, the first six of which will be a statutory consultation period during which residents and organisations will be invited to comment on the scheme. Four modal filters and three bus gates will initially be employed with the aim of reducing vehicular neighbourhood through traffic and increasing active travel in the area, in which around 17,000 people live. Changes based on consultation responses may be made to the scheme layout during the trial, in which case a further six month statutory consultation begins.Devon County Council is consulting until 14 August on proposals to convert a short stretch of cycle lane in NEW NORTH ROAD alongside John Lewis into a bus and cycle lane to reduce bus journey times. The new bus gate, part of the Devon Bus Service Improvement Plan, would enable around 200 buses a day to avoid travelling via Longbrook Street and York Road to reach the bus station and would also allow them to stop on Sidwell Street.Nicola Wheeler, currently Head of Community Programmes at Peabody, will become the new CEO of INEXETER, Exeter’s business improvement district company, in October. The company charges a 1.25% business rates levy on around 750 eligible organisations operating inside defined geographic boundaries which it primarily uses for promotional activities and events.Exeter-based South West shared mobility provider CO CARS, which is also responsible for CO BIKES e-bike hire, ceased trading on 14 July. It says the suspension of its services for long periods during the pandemic, changes in travel habits and the cost of living crisis have combined with high fuel and energy costs and supply chain issues to force the company into administration. Buyers for all or part of the business will now be sought.Another application to convert outbuildings and a garage to a three-bedroom house at Fernleigh Nurseries in the heart of LUDWELL VALLEY PARK has been submitted to the city council despite similar previous applications being twice rejected and dismissed at appeal.A contractor has applied on behalf of the city council for permission to rebuild and reinforce a section of ANCIENT CITY WALL on Bartholomew Street East beside the City Gate Hotel that collapsed in 2019.Devon County Council is holding a second consultation until 26 July on proposals it says will “improve facilities for active travel” in ALPHINGTON VILLAGE between the Alphin Brook roundabout and the double mini roundabout at the Shillingford Road turn. It follows another consultation that ended in January last year on similar “enhancements” which it claims will mitigate the impact of traffic from 2,500 new homes planned as part of the South West Exeter extension."

It has also confirmed that it approved nine of fifteen applications for HMO conversion that have been made in the Article 4 direction area since it was introduced in January 2012.MATFORD BROOK ACADEMY, a new “state of the art” Ted Wragg Trust school for 1,450 pupils of all ages intended to serve the South West Exeter extension, is now not expected to open in September because of problems with the building foundations.A new EXMOUTH AND EAST EXETER parliamentary constituency will replace most of the current East Devon seat held by MP Simon Jupp. The changes will reduce the Exeter constituency’s size, moving its current eastern boundary westwards so all of the city’s Pinhoe, St Loye’s and Topsham council wards will fall in the new seat. Nearly 9,000 Exeter voters are affected. Simon Jupp will contest the new Honiton and Sidmouth seat that will also be created as part of the changes, which the government is expected to approve in the next four months.A £6.4 million government grant for heat decarbonisation at RAMM and the RIVERSIDE LEISURE CENTRE is to be spent on a Riverside roof upgrade and the replacement of gas-fired boilers with air source heat pump systems at both buildings.The £16 million MARSH BARTON railway station is to open on 4 July, six and half years later than planned.A £190,000 HEAVITREE AND WHIPTON ACTIVE STREETS scheme trial will begin in August for up to eighteen months, the first six of which will be a statutory consultation period during which residents and organisations will be invited to comment on the scheme.

It will involve demolishing 30 buildings to provide more than 2,000 new student bedrooms, a net increase of nearly 1,500 on the current site provision, and will be ten times the size of the St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre. Furious local residents who say they have been stone-walled by the university during the three-year planning process were dismayed at the decision.The same planning committee meeting also granted Exeter Golf and Country Club permission to use 17 acres of privately-owned land that is part of LUDWELL VALLEY PARK as a golf driving range to replace their existing range on the other side of Rydon Lane, which will be developed for housing. A building and car park will be constructed on the greenfield site, which will remain inaccessible to the public, and conditions will restrict its use.ON THE AGENDAEXETER CITY COUNCIL is inviting reactions to its proposed amendments to its existing planning policy restrictions on the conversion of residential housing to multiple occupancy dwellings, frequently lived by students, near the university. Printed copies of its plans will also be available at the Civic Centre and in libraries until the consultation concludes on Monday.Proposals to vary a planning permission granted ten years ago to redevelop buildings on the corner of FORE STREET and WEST STREET that currently house Langans and Crankhouse Coffee to create a six storey block of thirteen flats with commercial units on the ground floor have been submitted to the city council for approval.

"content" : "Exeter City Council spent £3.2 million more than it received in income during the 2023-23 financial year, according to a budget review report that describes “an untenable position that the council cannot afford to reoccur”.A combination of wider factors including high inflation, high energy prices and a national council workers pay settlement all impacted on its finances at the same time as local income streams are not meeting budget expectations.Council finance director Dave Hodgson said in his report that the council’s 2023-24 budget had addressed some of the issues it faced, but there remained “areas of concern around income targets” for business rates, car parking and trade waste among other things.Leisure services cost the council £3.3 million last year against a budget of £2.3 million, resulting in a £1 million overspend, by far the largest on the year-end balance sheet.While income from leisure memberships have “exceeded expectations”, business rates and energy costs were both higher than predicted. Net annual service costs have been reduced to £2.2 million by closing the St Sidwell’s Point crèche, reduced staffing levels and accordingly reducing opening hours and increasing prices.All six of the council’s leisure centres will continue to require subsidies, with the possible exception of St Sidwell’s Point which, according to the report, “has the potential to become cost neutral at year five”. An accompanying risk assessment shows leisure services presenting the highest risk to the council’s medium term financial plan projections.A £900,000 budget to demolish the old bus station has not been spent this year due to difficulties in finding contractors. £100,000 has been added to this budget to explore “wider site options” in 2023-24.Council car parks income was also significantly below budget after a reduction in demand and an increase in charges resulting from drivers switching to paying with apps and cards instead of cash, leading to a shortfall of £600,000 against a target net income of nearly £6 million.Waterways spending was double its £375,000 budget due to the costs of cleaning up and disposing of a sunken ship among other cost increases and budgeting errors.At the same time the Guildhall shopping centre generated a £1.4 million surplus for the council following its £44 million leasehold purchase. Most of this budget surplus, which resulted from income uncertainties, is to be transferred to reserves.In February last year the council anticipated a four-year funding gap of £6.6 million. This has increased to nearly £10 million as a result of inflationary pressure on interest rates, energy costs and wages.It now expects its reserves to be reduced to the required minimum level of £3 million by 2024-25, with any further adverse impacts entailing additional spending cuts to balance its budget beyond the £2.236 million cost reductions it has agreed for 2023-24. It has just begun work on identifying cost reductions for 2024-25.

Subscribe freeWhile its net borrowing costs were lower than expected this year, at £660,000 against a budget of a little over £1 million, this was mainly the result of significantly higher than expected rates of return on council investments.Against this was a net loss of interest income resulting from not having to finance an additional £15.6 million loan to the council’s property development company Exeter City Living, which presents a medium-level risk to the council as rising interest rates could have a negative impact on income resulting from such loans.Its long-term borrowing already stands at just over £166 million (of which £72 million is being used to finance the council’s housing stock), it did not undertake any additional borrowing in 2022-23 because of uncertainty about interest rates, and it expected to borrow another £35 million between now and 2026-27 when the finance director’s report was written.The council Executive nevertheless decided this week to approve another £22 million of capital expenditure to enable Exeter City Living to deliver the second and third phases of its overdue Vaughan Road development after already committing £14.2 million to the first phase of a scheme that will provide a total of 91 flats on the site at a development cost of nearly £400,000 each."

"content" : "Exeter City Council is to use its compulsory purchase powers to acquire a block of four flats on the corner of Tan Lane and Water Lane and two nearby strips of land to make way for vehicular access to the southern section of the Water Lane redevelopment site.It says the acquisitions, which will be sold to the site’s developer, will enable the creation of a “gateway” to the development, a new access road alongside the railway line and the widening of Water Lane at its eastern end where there are no pavements and residents currently park.It also intends to dispose of the corner of its Exton Road recycling depot to enable better road access to the development site from the south side of the railway beside the existing Tan Lane underpass.Water Lane residential flats to be acquired to make way for highways access to development siteWater Lane Development Management Company has been acquiring and assembling parcels of land in the area for several years on behalf of Cilldara Group, part of a complex web of holding companies with property development interests across the UK and in Ireland.A report to the city council’s Executive committee says the company “has already tried acquiring the land parcels via negotiation” and would “continue to try to acquire the remaining interests by private treaty” but adds that “without the threat of compulsion it may be difficult to acquire the final strategic land holdings needed”.It says the acquisitions would be “in the public interest and of benefit to the well-being of existing residents” for a range of reasons centred on enabling site development. These include making “major shifts in mobility to take pressure off busy road corridors”, facilitating “continued operation of the canal” and providing “numerous growth and employment opportunities for the area (and Exeter as a whole)”.Both the developer’s attempts to acquire the land privately and the council’s claims about public benefit are intended to make a “compelling case” to justify the use of compulsory purchase powers to central government.Using these powers would also entail the developer agreeing to cover all the council’s costs, although such an indemnity agreement would not protect the council if the developer went bust, as the council’s finance director pointed out in the report.He also commented that the degree of financial risk this presented could not be assessed as the report did not specify how much the compulsory purchase might cost.Water Lane development site purchase parcels in red. Proposed new road layout in blue. Plan provided to council Executive committee meeting.At the Executive committee meeting councillors largely focussed on the impact their decision would have on the occupants of the four flats that would be demolished to make way for the development.Council leader Phil Bialyk asked what assurances council development director Ian Collinson could offer that the residents would not be “ousted with no alternatives”. Ian Collinson confirmed that a compulsory purchase order would be a “last resort” that would be used only if the land couldn’t be acquired though negotiation with its owner.When Phil Bialyk pointed out that his question was focussed on the tenants’ fate, rather than the outcome for the landlord, Ian Collinson replied that the process was being pursued without risk to the council and that the developer would be given “really clear messages” about people being “dealt with in a considered way”.Executive member Martin Pearce then commented that due process alone would not compel the landlord to take care of the tenants, and said that council officers would be offering the affected residents support with their housing needs.Councillor Duncan Wood added that it was “really good to hear those assurances”.Water Lane development site ownership in red. Plan provided to council Executive committee meeting.No-one asked, and the report doesn’t explain, how the acquisition of the flats would enable the creation of a “gateway” to the development given that, according to the provided ownership plan, the land they stand on is not adjacent to the land the developer has assembled.This map appears to show that most of the rest of the land on which the new highways layout is proposed is not in the developer’s control either.When we asked the council to clarify the position, it confirmed that Water Lane Development Management Company has now agreed to purchase plot twelve, enabling what the council calls an “appropriately safe and desirable access solution” to minimise “vehicular access to the regeneration area via Haven Road, maintaining the relatively quiet and pedestrian character of the quayside”.Vehicular access to the site is only possible from Alphington Road to the west via Haven Road or Willeys Avenue (restricted to inbound traffic from the Exe Bridges direction), and from Clapperbridge Lane to the east beside the new Marsh Barton railway station. Tan Lane is closed, except to buses.The 20% car ownership that is being proposed for the site would mean around 300 additional private cars on a per-household basis, but around 700 of them on a per-head basis if the 1,500 dwellings that are expected each housed the 2.36 people per household that is the national average.If the impact of the traffic generated by the development is to be minimised at the Haven Road end, and is not to travel along the narrow canalside route from the Clapperbridge end, it must access the site through Marsh Barton industrial estate.Water Lane development site land grant in red. Plan provided to council Executive committee meeting.This is why the council also proposes disposing of part of the Exton Road recycling depot to enable a new highways layout beside the “not really fit for purpose” Tan Lane underpass.Disposal would take the form of granting the land to Devon County Council, if highways officers agree, or selling it for less than best consideration to the developer, with the intention that it is used “to improve cycle, pedestrian and electric bus routes to the area”.It’s not clear whether construction traffic would also be able to travel this way because the railway running overhead restricts the height below.Selling it for best consideration, which the council would normally be required to do by law, is not recommended in the report on the grounds that “the greater the cost of the underpass improvements the less likely they are to be delivered”.The report also cites the value of the council’s contribution to a “circa million pound infrastructure improvement that could facilitate improved cycle, pedestrian and electric bus routes, reducing car usage and the savings associated with Exeter having a healthier population”.It adds: “Good access facilitates good trade as well as access to a wider workforce”.When Executive member Ruth Williams asked council development director Ian Collinson whether the land would end up in the hands of the county council or the developer, he said that while the county council was “fully on board with the movement and access strategy” there was “always that eventuality that for whatever reason [it] may choose not to adopt it”.He nevertheless said that he had an “absolute expectation” that the land would become part of the public highway.As with the compulsory purchases, the council’s finance director pointed out in the report that a land value assessment had not been provided, precluding a proper risk assessment. At the meeting the development director nevertheless said that the proposals present “limited, if any risk to the council”.Exton Road depot land with underpass to be repurposed for Water Lane development highways accessThe development director’s report describes the Water Lane area as “arguably the most exciting large scale brownfield regeneration opportunity in the city”.The council is currently presenting it as having two zones, although it is designated as a single site, including Haven Banks retail park at one end and Grace Road playing field at the other, in the outline draft version of the new Exeter local plan.The council’s northern zone is dominated by a former gas works. The southern zone, which runs alongside the railway line and is largely separated from the canal by existing housing and the northern zone, contains an electricity substation.Regeneration of the area has been intended for decades. Saved policies from the 1995-2011 Exeter Local Plan First Review and the 2012 Exeter Core Strategy propose mixed development including housing, leisure and employment use. Around 1,500 new dwellings are eventually expected in the area, of which nearly 1,200 are scheduled to come forward in the next fifteen years or so.Exeter City Futures had most of the site in its sights five years ago, intending to incorporate it in its Exeter Development Fund plans, but by January 2020 it had realised that a “significant amount of the land here has been purchased by a private developer which represents a risk to the inclusion of this key area within the overall project”.Liveable Exeter Place Board has also been monitoring the project. In December 2021 it was presented with a progress report that showed the gas works as included in the assembled land, but their redevelopment is now not expected before Water Lane Development Management Company, on behalf of a Cilldara Group subsidiary, gets underway in the southern zone.Water Lane development site regeneration zones. Plan provided to council Executive committee meeting.The city council signed a planning performance agreement with one of Cilldara Group’s subsidiaries last May. The council is also working on a Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) that is intended to provide a development framework and design code for the site, and to inform planning decision-making as applications come forward before the new Exeter Local Plan is adopted.A public consultation will be held on the Water Lane SPD in the autumn, although an outline planning application for the development is expected before then.Homes England is keen on the project. When Ian Collinson still worked there, before joining the council, he enthusiastically endorsed the Water Lane development plans, saying they would “exemplify the Liveable Exeter vision and set the benchmark for future development”.

The developer has led two public consultation exercises so far. The first took place in June and July last year, two years after a dedicated stakeholder engagement strategy was commissioned for project. The second was held in March and April this year. The council says that the “majority of the responses received to these consultations were supportive”.When the engagement strategy was shared with councillors in February last year, council officers said the council’s Liveable Exeter project team intended to use it as a template for all nine Liveable Exeter sites, in conjunction with the council’s consultation charter.One councillor responded by saying it “did not go far enough and did not adequately reflect the Liveable Exeter document’s ambition of putting people first in delivering better neighbourhoods and communities” and was “an insufficient bench mark for the remainder of Liveable Exeter sites”."

An extended 26 May deadline to sign a s106 legal agreement requiring developer contributions to health, education and affordable housing elsewhere in the city was not met. An extended deadline for its completion has now been set at 14 July, six years and nine months after the hotel burnt down.EXETER CITY FUTURES is to be dissolved at the end of June following the final event in its £250,000 National Lottery-funded community engagement programme. The eight-year-old company, on which the city council has spent nearly £500,000, is responsible for the redundant Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan.The city council has granted planning permission for PINHOE COMMUNITY HUB, a new building at Station Road playing fields, for the second time following the lapse of the previous permission that was granted in February 2020.Exeter Estates Holdings, a property development company that is controlled by Tony Rowe, CEO and chairman of Exeter Chiefs, has withdrawn its application to demolish ST THOMAS LIBARY and replace it with a block of thirteen flats following a public outcry in reaction to the plans.SOUTH WEST WATER owner Pennon Group has increased its shareholder dividend by nearly 11% to £112 million despite making a pre-tax loss of £8.5 million and being fined £2.15 million after pleading guilty to thirteen environmental offences committed across Devon and Cornwall. CEO Susan Davy said the company, which also owns Bristol Water, had “delivered improvements in environmental performance”.EXETER CITY COUNCIL member’s allowances and expenses came to a total of £409,000 in the year to March 2023, with council leader Phil Bialyk claiming £28,400 and receiving gifts and hospitality at Sandy Park.The city council has agreed to allow four music concerts at SANDY PARK STADIUM in June with up to 15,000 people in attendance, tickets for which have already been on sale for two months. Its planning committee heard accounts of extreme anti-social behaviour by visitors attending events at the venue as well as other adverse impacts on local residents and imposed traffic and parking, noise, litter and opening and closing time restrictions on the concerts.An Ofsted monitoring report on DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL CHILDREN’S SERVICES, the fifth since the local authority was judged inadequate in January 2020, has found that the “quality of social work practice across Devon remains inconsistent”. Inspectors found “pockets of better practice” and “some positive changes” but said that weak management oversight, insufficient challenge and poor care planning all continue to cause problems. It also said a high turnover rate in agency social work staff, who make up more than 40% of the workforce, is having an adverse impact.ON THE AGENDAA special meeting of Exeter Highways and Traffic Orders Committee (HaTOC) is being held at County Hall on Tuesday 20 June to discuss the HEAVITREE AND WHIPTON ACTIVE STREETS trial scheme following two public consultations and extensive community engagement. The scheme proposes three modal filters and two bus gates with the aim of reducing vehicular neighbourhood through traffic and increasing active travel in the area, in which around 17,000 people live. An online petition encouraging councillors to approve the proposals is being hosted on the county council website.EXETER CITY COUNCIL is inviting reactions to its proposed amendments to its existing planning policy restrictions on the conversion of residential housing to multiple occupancy dwellings, frequently lived by students, near the university. Printed copies of its plans will also be available at the Civic Centre and in libraries until the consultation concludes on 3 July.EXETER CITY LIVING is holding a public consultation on its Glasshouse Lane redevelopment plans, which have been revised following public feedback. The council-owned company is now proposing 24 housing units in a single four storey block on the south side of the site.Proposals to vary a planning permission granted ten years ago to redevelop buildings on the corner of FORE STREET and WEST STREET that currently house Langans and Crankhouse Coffee to create a six storey block of thirteen flats with commercial units on the ground floor have been submitted to the city council for approval.A public consultation on a draft DEVON, CORNWALL AND ISLES OF SCILLY CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY which will attempt to minimise the impact of climate change on the South West peninsula is under way until 30 June. The full draft strategy is here. Publication of a revised, final version of the plan is expected in August before partnership organisations will be invited to endorse it during the autumn, four and a half years after Devon County Council convened the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group to “act now to tackle [the] climate emergency”.

"content" : "Exeter City Council is holding a public consultation on its proposals to amend its current Article 4 direction and accompanying Houses in Multiple Occupation Supplementary Planning Document (HMO SPD).These are together intended to mitigate the impact of university expansion on the city’s residential housing stock by restricting the conversion of family housing into shared student accommodation in a defined area near the university’s Streatham campus.In this special report, intended to facilitate informed responses to the council consultation, we outline the history of the current Article 4 direction and summarise the council’s approach.We then consider the importance of reliable information in understanding the impact of the university’s growth on the city and highlight significant differences between the true numbers of its Exeter-based students and those it has been publishing, on which the council has relied in making student accommodation policy for the past fifteen years. We also ask whether the claim that Exeter student numbers have now peaked and will fall is credible.We examine the methods used by the council and its consultants to identify where students live, assessing their reliance on student council tax exemption and HMO licencing records which omit between 50% and 80% of student-occupied residential housing stock. We highlight key consequences of confusing licensing with planning matters and excluding unlicensed HMOs from the analysis and also touch on the role of Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA).We examine problems with using council tax exemptions to define Article 4 direction area geographic boundaries and consider the council consultants’ mapping of different exemption thresholds to propose potential new Article 4 direction scenarios.We then consider the council’s proposals, which differ from those presented by the consultants, and its reliance on misrepresenting the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) to justify changes that hardly add any residential streets to the existing Article 4 direction area at all.We ask whether the current Article 4 direction has achieved its ostensible purpose during the past eleven years, highlight the necessity of future monitoring and enforcement and question council procrastination over delivering policy change.We then assert that the most significant effect of university growth is its impact on the availability and price of private residential housing, and argue that new policies intended to address this issue should be included in the emerging Exeter Local Plan.We say they should be based on genuinely robust evidence derived from accurate mapping of the student penetration of residential housing stock using data the university holds, and that accompanying policy could set out incremental targets for the eventual accommodation of almost all the university’s students in PBSA, creating needed new residential housing supply from existing stock.We also say the university could and should provide car-free PBSA outside the city centre, with accompanying mobility services to enable students to travel between campus and halls, as other universities do.We conclude that an Article 4 direction area with evidence-based boundaries that would satisfy both NPPF requirements and Exeter’s need for student accommodation policy is not only possible but essential in the interests of the whole city.Residential housing stock in use as student HMOs - Victoria Street in St JamesThe current Article 4 directionThe current Article 4 direction came into force in January 2012, five years after Exeter City Council produced the first of many mostly unpublished reports on the impact of university expansion on Exeter. The HMO SPD that currently accompanies it was adopted in January 2014, replacing an initial 2011 version.The inadequacy of the council’s approach to student accommodation was already apparent to local residents: a 2009 petition signed by 350 St James’ residents said they were “concerned about the growing number of homes in multiple occupation in the ward”. Their petition proposed that “the whole of St James ward should be declared an area of planning restraint, in order both to protect us against a further increase in the number of HMOs and to maintain a balanced community”.In 2009 planning policy restrictions could not be applied to many student HMOs as they were too small: a group of up to six people living together was not treated as a material change of use from a family dwelling. However the following year the outgoing Labour government introduced a new planning use class which brought many more shared student houses under planning control.The subsequent coalition government then announced that it intended to retain the new use class, but would treat changes of use from family dwelling to HMO as permitted development that would not normally require planning permission.This compelled councils which wanted to restrict conversions of residential dwellings to HMOs to make an Article Four direction to remove those permitted development rights, specifically the right to change the use of a building from family housing to an HMO without needing planning permission. Their removal would not outlaw such conversions, but would mean planning permission would be required before they could take place.Exeter City Council duly proposed an Article Four direction area which would include streets in which 20% or more of dwellings were exempt from council tax because they were entirely occupied by students. At the time this equated to about 40 streets in St James, Newtown and Polsloe. In a further six streets more than two thirds of the dwellings were exempt from council tax for this reason.An accompanying HMO SPD set out the planning matters that would be considered when conversion applications were made inside the Article 4 direction area.

Responses included that the proposed 20% threshold was too high, reflecting research previously cited by the council which showed that a majority thought problems arose at a 10% threshold, and that it had been chosen arbitrarily. Others said that as student HMOs housed several people, often twice as many as a family dwelling, even a low threshold would equate to a significant proportion of the population in an area.Another petition, this time signed by 772 St James residents, was submitted as a consultation response. This called for the council to “prevent any further conversions to HMOs, except in those streets where the existing high number of HMOs has already significantly harmed the family residential character and where, therefore, it may be in the resident’s or residents’ interest to allow further conversions.”It also called for the council to “provide for all future Exeter university student accommodation in purpose-built developments on the campus itself or on discrete (individually distinct or separate) sites outside St James and other established residential neighbourhoods”.Rachel Sutton, then city councillor with responsibility for development, nevertheless took the decision, with a council officer, to confirm an Article 4 direction which only restricted HMO conversions in a small core area based on a 20% council tax exemptions threshold (excluding nine streets with very high existing concentrations of students) and defined adjacent “buffer zones” which would be subject to potential future restriction when student council tax exemptions reached 20%.Twelve month’s notice was given to avoid council liability for student landlord compensation claims and the Article 4 direction was adopted in January 2012. By May the following year the 20% threshold had already been exceeded in most of the “buffer zones”. The council admitted that despite the policies it had so far put in place there had “been a significant increase in shared student houses as a result of expansion by the University of Exeter” and in 2014 extended the restrictions to include all of the Article 4 area.The council hasn’t attempted to extend or update it until now.Exeter City Council proposed HMO Article 4 direction 2023. Source: consultation website.The council consultation on its proposalsThe council’s consultation on its proposals to amend the Article 4 direction asks respondents whether or not they support its preferred area revision option and to explain why. If they do not, it invites respondents to choose from three other options and explain that choice or offer an alternative proposal.It also asks respondents whether or not they support the council’s proposed HMO SPD, to explain why, and to comment on what they describe as “the evidence” supporting their proposals supplied by a consultants’ report and “informed by extensive data analysis and stakeholder consultations with local councillors, HMO landlords and letting agents, the University of Exeter, student representatives and city council officers”.A cursory glance at the council’s consultation materials immediately highlights the importance of providing reliable information to respondents. They lead with the claim that Exeter’s private rented sector “has undergone rapid growth over the past ten years”, presumably derived from the consultant’s report, which says: “The proportion of households in private rent has increased significantly over the past decade”.In fact, the proportion of privately renting households in Exeter only grew by 2.8% between the 2021 and 2011 census, while the city’s population grew by 11.1%.What did undergo rapid growth during this period, but is not quantified in the council’s consultation materials, is the number of University of Exeter students based at its Exeter campuses. This rose from 23,388 during the 2010-11 academic year to 35,105 during 2020-21, an increase of 50%.Exeter City Council proposed HMO SPD consultation draft 2023. Source: consultation website.Student numbers - the true pictureThe numbers of university students in the city are the first and most important data to get right in understanding the impact of the university’s growth. Any attempt to derive meaningful conclusions in combination with other data without accurate figures for this foundational set will fail.The council consultants twice mention that Higher Education Statistics Authority (HESA) data for University of Exeter student numbers includes students based at its Cornwall campus, which it correctly says are different from students based at its Exeter campuses. This is why Exeter Observer has never published HESA Exeter numbers, although apparently, according to the consultants, HESA data is “often reported in the press”.The consultants nevertheless rely on Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) student numbers supplied by the university. These combine full-time and part-time students into a single total that the university uses to plan educational provision although not, of course, the provision of accommodation. Doing so leads the consultants to conclude, for example, that “between 2010-11 and 2020-21 the average annual increase in the number of students in Exeter has been around 800 students per annum”.Following a series of freedom of information requests, we now know that the university’s FTE numbers have consistently and significantly understated the true picture for more than twenty years. In fact there were between 7,500 and 12,000 more students based in the city each year between 2000-01 and 2021-22 than the FTE numbers it published.While the university can choose what to publish on its website, its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 are legally binding. It is a criminal offence to alter or conceal information with the intention of preventing disclosure following a request for the information under the Act.Using these figures, we now also know that the average annual increase in the number of students in Exeter in the ten years to 2020-21 was actually nearly 1,200 – 46.5% more than the consultants concluded.Unfortunately, the council has also relied on the university’s student numbers, including future projections, as the basis of city planning policy for the past fifteen years.The 2010 Streatham campus masterplan, which is supposed to guide development to 2026, was based on the projection that there would be 15,800 FTE students on the campus by 2025-26. The 2012 Exeter Core Strategy, still the city’s principal planning policy document, is based on a projection that the number of full-time students living away from home in Exeter would be just 16,200 by the same year.According to the university’s own figures this limit had already been exceeded by 2013-14, twelve years early, by when there were actually 26,500 students based at its Exeter campuses.Even now, despite the council expressing scepticism about the university’s figures in unpublished reports, it apparently wants to believe them because “they suggest that the council’s current planning policy approach towards PBSA and student HMOs is achieving some success”.So the council’s proposed HMO SPD says: “The University of Exeter has grown significantly since 2006-7 from approximately 11,200 full-time equivalent students to 27,300 in 2021-22.” The true numbers tell a much more impactful story. In 2006-7 there were more than 22,600 students based at its Exeter campuses: by last year this had risen to nearly 39,000.Student numbers - have they peaked?There is no doubt that the university has grown far faster than planned. Have Exeter student numbers peaked and will they fall over the next few years, as the university claims?A significant drop in Exeter campus numbers to just under 29,600 this year follows two years in which university places were oversubscribed as a result of A-level grade inflation driven by teacher assessments made when exams were cancelled during the pandemic. This led to a surge in students gaining places at universities with more competitive entrance requirements.A fall in Exeter undergraduate numbers was then expected after OFQUAL intervened to deflate grades to their pre-pandemic levels over two years, affecting the 2022 and 2023 results. The university accordingly made fewer offers for entry this year, although more than half of the drop in this year’s numbers was accounted for by a fall in postgraduate students.The increase in tuition fees for new European Union students from 2021, and the end of their eligibility for tuition fee loans, is also likely to have contributed to this fall, although applications from other overseas students increased to record levels in the three years to 2022. As the council consultants note, while the level of UK domestic participation in higher education is among the highest in the world, and so is unlikely to rise much further, international student numbers may well continue to increase.Council officers are right to be cautious. Another unpublished report says: “The message of an anticipated net decrease in the number of students needing accommodation is consistent with last year’s Planning Member Working Group report. However, once again, members are reminded that the university’s annual estimates fluctuate each year and have been underestimated in the past.”Their conclusion? “One must be cautious about assuming that student numbers will vary exactly according to the projections”.Residential housing stock in use as student HMOs - Raleigh Road in St Leonard’sWhere do students live?Knowing how many university students are based in Exeter is the foundation of any assessment of the university’s impact on the city. To understand their impact on housing it is necessary to know where they live.The council’s proposed HMO SPD echoes the consultants’ report, saying: “Data on student council tax exemptions, PBSA planning permissions and HMO licences gives a good indication of the location of student accommodation within Exeter”.Obviously PBSA, whether built or planned, is intended to supply student accommodation, as are the co-living developments that are on their way too. However both student council tax exemptions and HMO licenses provide, at best, a partial account of where Exeter students live during term-time that omits between 50% and 80% of the residential housing stock they occupy.  Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)  A house in multiple occupation (HMO) is a property rented out by at least three people who are not from one household (for example a family) but share facilities like the bathroom and kitchen. It’s sometimes called a house share.  A licence is required to rent out a large HMO in England or Wales. A property is defined as a large HMO if all of the following apply:      it is rented to five or more people who form more than one household    some or all tenants share toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities    at least one tenant pays rent (or their employer pays it for them).    Mandatory licensing of HMOs came into force in 2006 and originally applied to properties of three or more storeys with five or more people making up two or more separate households living in them.  The scope of mandatory HMO licensing was extended in October 2018 so that properties used as HMOs in England which house five or more people in two or more separate households will in many cases require a licence.  A useful House of Commons Library briefing is available on the subject.Houses in Multiple OccupationThe first major flaw in the council consultants’ approach is its reliance on HMO licensing records, although it appears that council officers may have muddied the waters by telling them that the “definition of an HMO is largely the same for planning and licensing”.This is obfuscation. The permitted development rights that are the focus of Article 4 directions are a planning, not licensing, matter. They cover HMOs which have between three and six unrelated occupants whether they are licensed or not.Licenses are only required for HMOs when five or more people form more than one household, some of whom share toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities and at least one of whom pays rent.The requirement to license HMOs with five or more occupants is not related to permitted development rights that allow a change of use from dwellinghouse to HMO with between three and six occupants, and which Article 4 directions can remove. Both existing and proposed Exeter City Council Article 4 directions apply to the latter, not the former.In addition, HMOs with more than six occupants are treated as sui generis because they do not fall in the same use class as those with six or fewer. Permitted development rights do not apply to such HMOs, so they always require planning permission, but they are included in the council HMO SPD so planning applications made for such conversions are also covered by the policy.Employing HMO licensing distinctions to frame unrelated HMO planning restrictions leaves council consultation respondents in the dark over the scope of the policy. It also leads to absurd observations such as: “Some housing areas perceived as being high in HMOs are in fact areas of primarily private rental/student rental”.Licensed HMOs &amp;amp; “non-HMO” private rental properties in Monks Road area. Source: consultants’ report.An illustration in the consultants’ report demonstrates the fallacy. It says it depicts “an area with many HMOs where there are also a large number of non-HMO rental properties”.  The consultants seem not to be aware that the distinction they claim between the two is neither how things are laid out in planning policy nor on the ground in the Monks Road area.In the sole paragraph in their 64 page report in which they touch on this issue, they suggest that up to six unrelated students sharing a house could nevertheless constitute a single household because they could be considered to be what they call a “closely knit peer group”. This is despite planning policy guidance that typically exemplifies this kind of household as “a homeowner living with a lodger” or “a small religious community”.(They also cite a St James HMO appeal decision from last year despite it concerning a house in Hoopern Street in which unrelated sharers already lived.)Were Exeter’s unrelated student housesharers to be treated as single households for planning policy purposes, an Article 4 direction that removes permitted HMO development rights would have extremely limited scope as it would not apply to any student houseshares with six or fewer residents.And although there may be some mixed HMOs in the Article 4 direction area in which not all residents are students, the accompanying HMO SPD makes clear that its primary purpose is addressing housing impacts resulting from the university’s growth. As a result it would not apply to these houseshares either.It would also not apply to houseshares with more than six residents in any combination as they all fall outside the planning use classes which Article 4 directions address.On the view put forward by the consultants and reflected in their claim that “the increase in private rental for both students and non-students is outside planning controls”, it is hard to see to what the proposed Article 4 direction and accompanying HMO SPD planning controls might actually apply.The consultants’ focus on licensed HMOs also obscures just how much Exeter housing stock that might otherwise be used to house residents is instead being occupied by students.Relying solely on council HMO licensing figures, they conclude that Exeter HMO numbers are only increasing at a net rate of twenty per annum and peaked at 1,385 last year. What about all the unlicensed HMOs in the city?The council is required to estimate how many there are of these by central government each year. The resulting MHCLG figures show that total Exeter HMO numbers increased significantly between 2012, when the council told the government there were 2,510 in the city of which 836 were licensed, and 2018, when it said there were 4,412 HMOs in Exeter of which 903 were licensed.However the council’s estimated total has remained exactly the same as its 2018 return for the past five years running, so its estimates for the four years since 2018 must be viewed with extreme scepticism. Not least because it also says that there are now nearly 500 more licensed HMOs than there were then, so the number of unlicensed HMOs must have fallen by exactly the same amount at the same time. Quite a coincidence.If, instead, the statistical trend in the three years before the council’s total HMO estimate became fixed in place has continued, the true number of HMOs in the city is now more likely to be in excess of 7,200. This would be consistent with the rise in student numbers during the past five years, and would mean that around 80% of the city’s HMOs are missing from the consultants’ analysis.Student council tax exemptionsThe second major flaw in the council consultants’ approach is its reliance on student council tax exemption records.Back in 2010 the council thought that student council tax exemption figures provided “the most robust, evidence-based approach to identifying” student occupation of residential housing. In December 2021 it still thought they were a reliable “indicator of the distribution of the student population”.There are several reasons why not. One is that the exemptions apply to dwellings, which range from individual studio flats to multi-bedroom cluster flats with a dozen occupants or more. A second is that some students live in mixed households which cannot claim exemption, or in student households which do not. A third, as a 2015 Monks Road study showed, is that students often live in residential housing that was once council tax exempt but is no longer.The ONS concluded in November 2021 that council tax records cannot be relied on for this purpose after it found that only half of all student addresses have any indication on council tax that students live there.So not only should the council assume that its HMO licensing data omits around 80% of the city’s HMOs, it should also assume that its council tax exemption data omits around half the city’s university students.Its current HMO SPD acknowledges that “not all students who live in private houses are in properties that are registered as exempt from council tax” and that “the figures for council tax exemptions do not show the whole picture” as far as HMOs are concerned. Emma Morse, the councillor who is responsible for city development, acknowledged the limitations of council tax exemption data at a meeting in January this year.But both the consultants’ analysis and the council’s proposed Article 4 direction and HMO SPD nevertheless rely on them from the ground up.Student council tax exemptions by accommodation type. Source: consultants’ report.Purpose Built Student AccommodationCouncil tax exemption figures for private sector-provided PBSA are collected by central government alongside student exemptions in residential housing stock, but student accommodation that is owned and managed by the university falls under a different council tax exemption regime.The consultants’ report found that Exeter had “around 6,900 households with student council tax exemptions in March 2022” of which it reckoned 2,450 were accommodated in private PBSA and 1,700 by the university with another 2,750 residential dwellings exempt of which just under 1,000 were licensed as HMOs.However these finding are inconsistent with the MHCLG figures, which the report acknowledges. But the report then fails to distinguish between the two student council tax exemption regimes.What is the true split? Back in 2006 the council thought “about 50%” of Exeter’s university students lived in private rented accommodation. At the time there were 22,600 students based at the university’s Exeter campuses of which around 11,300 would therefore have been living in the city’s residential housing stock.By the end of last year the council thought 49% of the university’s Exeter students were living in private rented accommodation, so the proportion had hardly changed. But Exeter university student numbers had increased to just over 38,800, which would mean that an additional 7,700 students were living in residential stock.Are the council’s percentages reliable? By last October there were just under 12,500 bedspaces in private PBSA and university accommodation combined. The consultants cite “reports of very high occupancy” rates of around 90% – without providing sources – which would mean nearly 11,250 Exeter university students could be living in this form of term-time accommodation.This would leave another 18,350 Exeter campus-based students living in residential housing stock, 62% of the total this year, following the fall in student numbers. This is 7% more than the council says in its proposed HMO SPD.What about HMOs? The consultants estimate that these provide “around 9,100 habitable student bedspaces”. This accounts for fewer than half the students who are not in PBSA this year, omitting more than 9,200 of them from their analysis. These students are likely to be living in around 2,650 dwellings at the average occupancy rate cited in previous council reports.The consultants account for 2,750 non-PBSA student households in their analysis. So that’s a total of 5,400 residential dwellings occupied by students in Exeter this year. 41% of the private rented housing stock and nearly 600 more than the city’s supply of council-owned homes.The consultants also estimated that there are around 6,000 private rented dwellings in Exeter, apparently relying on Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data. However, as they acknowledge in a footnote, the 2021 census found 13,100 private rented dwellings in the city, well over twice as many. They do not, however, recalculate findings such as those depicted in a map of private rental property locations which omits more than 7,000 dwellings as a result.Private rental property locations according to EPC data. Source: consultants’ report.A 20% council tax exemption thresholdThe council’s proposed HMO SPD says it “will continue to monitor HMO licences, PBSA delivery and student council tax exemptions” to make student accommodation policy. But relying on these figures to identify where university students live in Exeter, at least those who do not live in PBSA, means making policy without considering around half of those who live in the city’s residential housing stock. More if the unsourced reports of PBSA occupancy rates cited by the consultants are unreliable too.Similar problems arise when student council tax exemptions are used to define the geographic boundaries to which the policy applies. The boundaries of the existing Article 4 direction area were decided by including streets in which 20% or more dwellings were student council tax exempt and excluding a handful where student numbers were so high that remaining residents would be disadvantaged by an HMO conversion prohibition when they sold up.This 20% threshold originated in a 2008 council planning policy, was fixed in the council’s initial 2011 HMO SPD and has remained in place ever since despite apparently being chosen because it looked about right on the ground at the time to council officers. It was supposed to define the point at which of an overconcentration of HMOs would adversely affecting community balance, as laid out the (still current) Exeter Local Plan and included in the St James Neighbourhood Plan.In their review the consultants apply 2011 census output area data to conclude that the 20% threshold “would appear a ‘tipping point’ where the character begins to change toward student-dominated areas”. But they also say: “There is no locally robust metric of percentages, and the figures vary from council to council”, although their brief assessment of eleven other Article 4 direction areas finds that many councils employ a 10% threshold instead, albeit with varying calculation methods.Current Article 4 direction area. Source: consultants’ report.Mapping the 20% thresholdTo map the locations where this 20% threshold might now apply, and so propose new Article 4 direction area boundaries, the consultants recommend the use of unique postcode level data. They say doing so “provides the most efficient basis for assessment of numbers of council tax exemptions and numbers of properties” and “simplifies joining of council tax records, HMO licencing and other data”.An average of just under 52 residents live in each unique postcode area in Exeter but postcode populations in the city range from zero in commercial areas to as many as 600 on the university’s Streatham campus. The consultants acknowledge the problems this creates, and that other councils use ONS output area data to set their Article 4 direction area boundaries instead because they “smooth out” these inconsistencies. But they nevertheless (mostly) stick to using postcode data in their analysis.They find “65 postcode areas where more than 50% of residential properties are student households” as well as “several areas outside the current Article 4 area [that] have now passed a threshold of 20% of properties being student housing” while more are “approaching the 20% tipping point”.This suggests, as their analysis omits around half the students who are not living in PBSA, that there may be 65 postcode areas in which student households occupy more or less all the residential housing stock, and several other areas in which they occupy around 40% of the dwellings.The consultants take these 65 postcode area and mix them with ONS output areas where the 20% council tax exemption threshold is exceeded. Then they make “minor infilling and adjustments as required” and include the university campus and student halls “for completeness” and “the entirety of postcode sector EX4 6” because of “several pockets of very high concentrations of student housing” as well as “the proximity to the university” and “an overall concentration of 29% student housing”.They also cite “evidence of ‘leapfrogging’ pressure” which they say accelerates the spread of student housing across the city because a “tightly drawn Article 4 area” has “the effect of dispersing new HMOs to areas away from the existing student concentrations”.They finally recommend “that the data is examined to ensure areas flagged as 20% due to the presence of very few residential addresses are not incorrectly added to the map.”Notwithstanding their omission of thousands of student-occupied dwellings, as well as proximity effects around St Luke’s campus, they employ this hotch-potch to map potential new Article 4 direction area boundaries that they present as a continuity option.Consultants’ Article 4 direction area report continuity option 2 map. Source: consultants’ report.A 10% threshold with “student quarters”?The consultants also present an expansion option. This maps potential Article 4 direction area boundaries using a student council tax exemption threshold of 10% and by identifying areas that are already “overwhelmingly” student housing (with 70% or more student households, of which they identify several) to create student quarters in which HMOs would be encouraged to prevent leapfrogging.However they caution that a 10% threshold would be “a departure from the current approach” that is “untested and may be vulnerable to challenge”. Unless the Article 4 area review does no more than fiddle at the margins it will fit this description anyway.They also say that a new local plan policy “may be required to ensure HMO growth and PBSA remain balanced” if the council adopts an expanded Article 4 area, which “would require significant changes to local plan and SPD policy and justification”. No explanation of why such a policy would be required or what changes to existing Exeter planning policy would be necessary is provided.They add that any changes would mean the council would “need to consult widely and carefully document the process and rationale for the decision”. This is supposed to be what the council is doing now.Consultants’ Article 4 direction area report expansion option 3 map. Source: consultants’ report.A wider Article 4 direction area?The consultants also briefly consider whether an Article 4 direction covering all the city’s built-up area (which is rather less than the whole city) would be viable. They say this option would aim to “limit growth in HMOs (for students) with a focus on delivering PBSA to meet 100% of the growth in the student population”, very much as the 2010 St James residents’ petition called for.They also say it would entail the introduction of “detailed criteria-based policies for supporting delivery of non-student HMOs” in order to meet the needs of people such as those with live-in carers or protected characteristics who may need this form of accommodation as well as low-income single households which rely on housing benefit to pay the rent.There doesn’t seem to be any reason why such a policy could not be introduced. But the consultants nevertheless conclude, despite not quantifying any of their claims, that a broadscale Article 4 area “would severely inhibit the delivery of HMOs for non-student residents” and “place a large obstacle in the way of providing such accommodation” as well as a “significant burden” on council development management.They are also confident that “most of the Exeter City Council area features neighbourhoods with no student housing, and many areas are not targets for student HMO conversion”. While there is no doubt that student housing is much more concentrated in some parts of Exeter than others, student housing can now be found across large swathes of the city.The consultants are correct to say that a broadscale approach would require more comprehensive analysis, but more comprehensive analysis is needed in any case.  And while they say that the policies needed to accompany it would have to be introduced as part of the new Exeter Local Plan, the introduction of new planning policies and supporting evidence is precisely what local plan-making is for.The council began a major public consultation on a draft outline version of the new Exeter Local Plan last September, three months after the consultants’ report was substantially complete. Yet the draft outline plan did not address student accommodation at all, despite government planning reform proposals that mean such policies will have to be presented in local plans instead of SPDs, which are due to be phased out.A 10% threshold mapping that extended the consultants’ third option to include the missing 9,000 or so students who are living in Exeter’s residential housing stock but do not appear in the council tax exemption records could have offered a firm basis for a appropriate draft outline local plan policy, but was not provided.This would have articulated a comprehensive Article 4 direction area option much more usefully than simply drawing a line around Exeter’s built-up area and saying it is too big.Consultants’ Article 4 direction area report built-up area option 4 map. Source: consultants’ report.The council’s consultation optionsInstead of relying on the consultants’ Article 4 area boundary mappings, the council proposes significantly different boundary options in its consultation documents. No explanation for the differences is provided.Consultation option two is the council’s preferred option, a scaled back version of the consultant’s continuity option that hardly adds any residential streets to the existing Article 4 direction area at all. The council nevertheless claims these boundaries would “help to maintain some balance between student and non-student housing in the area” while not “unduly” restricting the provision of HMOs for non-students.Council Article 4 direction area consultation option 2 map. Source: consultation website.Consultation option three is a scaled back version of the consultant’s expansion option that removes almost all the exclusion zones intended to prevent leapfrogging outside the Article 4 area. The council comes up with several reasons why the city should not adopt this option.It says small postcodes either side of the new boundary “may regularly change between meeting and not meeting the 10% threshold”, but this would be true of any Article 4 area boundary set at any marginal threshold percentage.It says “additional work” would “be needed to identify new exempt areas”, although as none of the exclusion zones suggested by the consultants appear on the council’s option map it isn’t clear where these new exempt areas would be.It also says this option would “mark a significant change from our current planning policy on HMOs, potentially requiring a new planning policy which will take time for us to adopt” which it says would “delay our ability to introduce a new Article 4 direction”. The council does not explain why it suddenly finds itself in such a hurry after so many years of inaction, nor account for the delays in the review process for which it is responsible.It also says it doesn’t like this option as it would “require PBSA to be provided at higher rates in order to meet student housing needs” despite its current policy already aiming to increase PBSA delivery to house 75% of the additional students that come to Exeter as a result of the university’s expansion.Council Article 4 direction area consultation option 3 map. Source: consultation website.Council consultation option four is, in contrast, an expanded version of the consultant’s built-up area option boundaries that extends them to match the city’s entire administrative footprint, including large areas of greenspace around most of the built-up area’s edges.Unsurprisingly, as the consultants’ did not consider this option, the council says it is “not justified by the evidence gathered”. It repeats the consultants’ criticisms of their version of this option without acknowledging that there are ways of making a truly comprehensive Article 4 area work.Council Article 4 direction area consultation option 4 map. Source: consultation website.National Planning Policy Framework complianceThe council also promotes consultation option two, in contrast with options three and four, as compliant with NPPF guidance that “Article 4 Directions are justified by clear evidence and applied to the smallest geographical area possible”. It says the fourth option is “highly contrary” to this requirement.The consultants also say their fourth option would not comply with the guidance because “the data does not appear to justify including residential areas outside of the city centre” and “much of Exeter has no student properties or HMOs”. However they rely on 2011 census data to make this claim, which would not hold water were unlicensed HMOs included in the analysis.They initially say the logic of increasing HMO conversion opportunities in student areas while restricting them in areas which still have a low percentage of student properties, as per their version of option three, is “robust and can be justified as compliant with guidance”. But they end by saying bluntly that it “does not meet NPPF requirements” without providing any more detail.  National Planning Policy Framework  53. The use of Article 4 directions to remove national permitted development rights should:      where they relate to change from non-residential use to residential use, be limited to situations where an Article 4 direction is necessary to avoid wholly unacceptable adverse impacts (this could include the loss of the essential core of a primary shopping area which would seriously undermine its vitality and viability, but would be very unlikely to extend to the whole of a town centre)    in other cases, be limited to situations where an Article 4 direction is necessary to protect local amenity or the well-being of the area (this could include the use of Article 4 directions to require planning permission for the demolition of local facilities)    in all cases, be based on robust evidence, and apply to the smallest geographical area possible.    54. Similarly, planning conditions should not be used to restrict national permitted development rights unless there is clear justification to do so.  Department for Levelling Up, Housing and CommunitiesNPPF paragraph 53 was updated in 2021, when the “robust evidence” and “smallest geographical area possible” provisions were added.The consultants quote National Planning Practice Guidance saying that there would “need to be a particularly strong justification for the withdrawal of permitted development rights relating to a wide area (e.g. those covering a large proportion of or the entire area of a local planning authority)”. However this guidance was published in 2010 and so predates NPPF, which was first published in 2012 and updated in 2018, 2019 and 2021.The Secretary of State issued a Written Ministerial Statement immediately before the 2021 NPPF update came into force that laid out the government’s intentions in changing the rules around the use of Article 4 directions.It said: “This change only applies to changes from non-residential to residential use. This change does not apply to changes between different residential uses, which will enable local authorities to continue to restrict change of use from a family home to a house of multiple occupancy where that is necessary to protect local amenity or the well-being of an area.” (Bold type reproduced from the original.)It also said: “Article 4 directions should be very carefully targeted, applying only to those locations where they are necessary to avoid wholly unacceptable adverse impacts. For that reason, I want to make clear that the geographical coverage of all Article 4 directions should be the smallest area possible to achieve the aim of the Article 4 direction.” (Bold type added for emphasis.)The Secretary of State also asserted his powers to intervene where Article 4 directions do not comply with the new policy, a risk council development director Ian Collinson emphasised in his report to the Executive committee meeting that approved the current consultation.His report also said: “The Planning Practice Guidance states however that the Secretary of State will only intervene in Article 4 directions where there are clear reasons for doing so”, and: “The evidence base and undertaking robust and transparent public consultation on the direction should reduce this risk.”What it did not say is that since the new rules were introduced the Secretary of State has not intervened in a single Article 4 direction that restricts changes of use from family homes to HMOs despite intervening twenty times in other cases in the course of less than twelve months.Of these interventions seventeen concerned commercial to residential changes of use, confirming the intention expressed in the Written Ministerial Statement, which was “to support High Streets” by introducing a “higher threshold for making Article 4 directions relating to change of use to residential”. The other three interventions concerned restrictions on adding storeys on flats and houses and creating new housing via demolition.The consultants do not consider the ministerial statement or subsequent ministerial interventions in their report.Robust evidence would indeed be required to support a significantly extended Article 4 direction area. But gathering such evidence, including the missing 9,000 or so students who are living in Exeter’s residential housing stock but cannot be identified in the council tax records, perhaps to map what the 10% threshold and student quarters outlined in the consultants’ third option actually looks like, should be straightforward.Then the council could propose an Article 4 direction area that covers the smallest area possible to achieve its purpose, as the Secretary of State said, and justify its policy with truly robust data rather than relying on a mishmash of methologies and partial postcode level and output area data that the consultants emphasise is “the smallest geography from which to work” without querying whether this is what NPPF paragraph 53 intends.HMO license locations in Exeter city centre. Source: consultants’ report.Has the Article 4 direction worked?What’s also missing from the consultants’ report is a proper assessment of whether the existing Article 4 direction has actually worked.We asked the council how many planning applications for change of use from residential housing to HMO have been made in the Article 4 direction area since it removed permitted development rights for such conversions in January 2012, as well as how many had been approved.We also asked it how many times it had taken enforcement action against Article 4 direction breaches since then and how many such actions had been successful.We thought these figures would be obvious metrics with which to measure the policy’s success, but the council evidently does not as it doesn’t collate them. (We have since submitted a freedom of information request for the information and will report it when it has been compiled and released.)It also doesn’t collect data on policy compliance. As Councillor Emma Morse, the Executive member with responsibility for city development, admitted in June 2021, the council is “not able to undertake regular or proactive compliance monitoring in relation to the Article 4 directive area”.She said that it instead relied on complaints from members of the public who suspect that properties are being used as HMOs without the necessary permissions, adding that “the number of such complaints was, however, very low, there being two in 2017, one in 2018 and none since then.”When asked how likely it was that unlawful HMO conversions in the Article 4 direction area were “slipping through the net”, she replied that, because of the council’s reliance on complaints and its “limited capacity for additional monitoring and enforcement of the Article 4 restrictions” it did not “have any data on the impact on residential character”.An unpublished council report from October last year also admitted that the council “does not have the monitoring evidence to be able to draw clear conclusions” on the reason for an “increase in the number of exempt properties” inside the Article 4 area, adding: “Without significant resources being made available for monitoring, enforcement and communication with HMO landlords, the number of student HMOs within some parts of the Article 4 area may start to increase again.”In January this year when Councillor Tess Read asked Emma Morse how many houses had been returned to family use from HMO occupancy as a result of the policy, Emma Morse said she did not know, but did acknowledge that the number of HMOs had increased. A council officer attending the meeting nevertheless claimed that the policy was deterring conversions in the Article 4 area.Residential housing stock in use as student HMOs - Sylvan Road in PennsylvaniaHow do student HMOs affect Exeter?Councillors were told last year that the consultants would assess “the impact of additional HMOs on local communities and amenities” as part of their review. Blight, waste, parking, noise and antisocial behaviour were all covered in just seven paragraphs in their report, which nevertheless included rather surprising findings such as “very few undergraduates have cars”.Notwithstanding their impact en masse in parts of the city, the majority of Exeter university students are responsible and socially-minded. But community balance considerations are not the only issue that the council’s student accommodation policy should address. Neither consultants’ report nor council policy deal with the most significant effect of university growth: its impact on the availability and price of private residential housing.Renting to students is much more profitable for landlords than renting to families, as students (or their parents) are charged rents that are often close to double residential rates. The inflated value of the city’s housing stock as student HMOs frequently makes it unaffordable to residents.Thousands of dwellings that were owner-occupied or resident-rented have been become student accommodation across the city in the eleven years since the Article 4 direction came into force. Any city in which such a high proportion of the residential housing stock is occupied by students needs planning policy that gets to grips with this issue and its consequences, yet the council’s preferred consultation option is barely discernible from doing nothing at all.Even after realising two years ago that it could no longer ignore the issue when a group of Pennsylvania residents petitioned it to expand the Article 4 area, it took six months to decide to hold a review, then allowed fourteen months to pass before the consultants finished their report, with the local elections providing an excuse to delay the consultation for a further four months.It doesn’t intend to make a decision on the final version of its proposals until the end of this year, which means the new Article 4 direction area will not come into force until the end of 2024 because twelve months’ notice is required to limit any claims for financial compensation. Could there be a single student landlord in Exeter who has not, by now, had more than enough time to search out all the residential housing stock that they might ever want to convert to HMOs?Councillors were told in March last year that the new policy would come into force a year earlier, at the end of 2023. But had the council addressed the Pennsylvania petition promptly it could have commissioned consultants in August 2021, approved a public consultation in January 2022 and made a final decision in May — which would have meant a new Article 4 area direction, for what it might be worth, coming into force last month.Taking as long as it has, and knowing as it does that any new HMO SPD almost certainly has a very limited lifespan, the council should not only be seeking truly robust data on which to base its student accommodation policies, it should be intending those policies to form a significant element of the new Exeter Local Plan.  New Exeter Local Plan  The new Exeter Local Plan will replace the city’s 2012 Core Strategy and the policies saved from the 1995-2011 Exeter Local Plan First Review when it is adopted.  It is expected to facilitate the Liveable Exeter property development scheme by providing a scheme-focussed “vision and framework for the future development of the city”.  County mineral and waste plans also form part of Exeter’s planning policy framework, as do Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) which provide additional guidance.  Exeter’s SPDs will be reviewed in the context of emerging Exeter Local Plan policies as well as ongoing changes to the National Planning Policy Framework, but not directly as part of the new local plan process.  Neighbourhood plans, produced by local groups, also form part of planning policy frameworks. Exeter’s includes one such plan which covers the St James area.  An evidence base also supports and informs local planning policy development.  Plan preparation progress is set out in annual monitoring reports, while periodic statements set out the city’s five year housing land supply position.  The current timetable for the preparation of the new local plan is set out in the 2021 Local Development Scheme:      September 2021: an initial consultation framed the content and scope of the plan    September 2022: a resulting draft plan was published for public consultation    February 2023: a revised plan should have been published for formal comments on its legal compliance and soundness    June 2023: the resulting draft final plan should have been submitted to the planning inspectorate with formal comments and supporting evidence    October 2023: a planning inspector would have examined the submissions, held plan examination hearings, proposing any necessary changes and producing a final report    June 2024: the final plan would have been adopted.    This timetable was doomed by the time last September’s public consultation began: the outline draft plan was hastily thrown together and far from ready for serious scrutiny.  A revised Local Development Scheme is now being presented at the June Executive committee meeting. It inserts an additional consultation stage in October 2023, with publication a year later, submission in March 2025 followed by examination in June and adoption now scheduled for the end of 2025.  Student accommodation policy for ExeterFor the council to make student accommodation planning policy in the interests of the whole city it needs to do more than repeat the many mistakes it has made in setting it so far, whether intentionally or otherwise.It needs to understand the limitations of the information it holds, and the limits of the consultants’ analysis which follows. It should recognise the fallacy of using council tax exemptions and HMO licenses to identify where students live in residential housing stock and stop pretending that the number of student HMOs has been fixed for the past five years.It should instead use the true number of university students in Exeter, not FTEs, to calculate term-time student accommodation requirements and so accurately frame its policies.To do so it also needs to know how many students actually stay in university-provided accommodation and privately-provided PBSA, not how many beds would be occupied if all such blocks were full, and so how many others are living in the city’s residential housing stock.Exeter PBSA map. Source: University of Exeter.We requested this information from the university for the 2021-22 academic year under freedom of information legislation last August. The university has been by turns evasive, defiant and silent in response. Following an Information Commissioner’s Office investigation a judge will decide the case at a First-tier Information Rights Tribunal sometime in the next few weeks.We hope to report the facts of the matter soon after, then request the same data for each of the past twenty years to enable the council not only to understand the top-level distribution of students in different types of accommodation during its long period of growth, but also to make independent predictions about the university’s future growth based on accurate historical data instead of the university’s repeatedly unreliable projections.We have so far asked only for summary information: there is nothing precluding the university sharing the data it holds on student occupation of housing stock at ONS output area and postcode level with the council. Provided the information is not personally-identifying it would comply with data protection rules.This data would enable the council to accurately map the student penetration of residential housing stock and so provide truly robust evidence to support an Article 4 direction area with truly evidence-based boundaries.Exeter HMOs to rent via the university in November 2022. Source: University of Exeter.However there is little point in the council spending time and resources on a policy which is intended to restrict the conversion of residential housing stock to HMOs if it does not allocate sufficient resources to monitor or enforce it.In such circumstances an expanded Article 4 direction area would be just as ineffective as the current Article 4 direction already is. There are many ways the council could finance the requisite resources: effectively-targeted Community Infrastructure Levy charges is just one of them.The council could also use the new Exeter Local Plan to pass student housing policies that would compel the university to take responsibility for the supply of accommodation it needs to fulfil its development plans without treating the city as an externality.This would include changing its PBSA policy so that instead of aiming to accommodate 75% of additional students in PBSA it would aim to accommodate all the university’s students (who are not already residents) that way.According to landlords interviewed by the council’s consultants, there has been “no softening in demand for student flats and HMOs as a result of increases in PBSA”. Without setting well-defined and target-based policies for achieving these aims, and effectively monitoring and enforcing them, there can be no hope of increasing numbers of students moving into PBSA as each new cohort arrives.Such a policy would still take years to reclaim the city’s residential housing stock from student occupation, but is a much better route to substantially increasing the city’s housing supply than building to rent at the extreme densities being proposed on major Liveable Exeter sites.

The university’s own data confirms the figure was much higher last year and remains higher now, at nearly 23%. Perhaps the new Exeter Local Plan should also seek to set the bar beyond which the whole city becomes imbalanced because too many students live here during term-time?UPDATE – 29 June 2023The council has now confirmed that it has never taken enforcement action against Article 4 direction breaches in the city. It has also confirmed that nine of fifteen applications for permission for change of use from dwellinghouse to HMO that have been made in the Article 4 direction area since it was introduced in January 2012 were approved."

"content" : "Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission first judged Devon County Council Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) children’s services inadequate in 2018.They found “significant weaknesses” in local implementation of SEND reforms introduced by the government in 2014, four years earlier.A follow-up inspection last May found that the county council’s SEND improvement strategy was still not being implemented on the ground. Issues with recruitment and staff retention were not being addressed and communication with parents remained poor.Devon County Council acknowledged its failings but in October the Department of Education found that while there had been some improvement the council was “still failing to perform to an adequate standard”.The county council created an independently-chaired SEND Improvement Partnership Board, which includes county council SEND officers and its chief executive, NHS Devon, local schools and Department for Education advisors.The board produced a SEND improvement plan, which it published in April. It followed a protest at County Hall aimed at highlighting what organisers Devon SEND Parents and Carers for Change described as “relentless institutional failings” in Devon SEND services provision.At the same time an investigation by a small group of county council children’s scrutiny committee members was underway, examining the challenges facing the council in meeting the needs of SEND children and young people and identifying specific actions to be taken.The task group’s report, which took twelve months to produce, was delivered to the county council cabinet in December but a follow-up meeting of the committee on Tuesday heard that little progress had been made in the six months since then.Children’s scrutiny committee meeting at County Hall on TuesdayJackie Ross, interim director of county council SEND services, told the meeting that improvement depended on recruiting caseworkers, rearranging systems for communicating with families and clearing an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) referrals backlog.A completed EHCP assessment is key to accessing additional support for children and young people with special educational needs. There are around 8,500 learners with an EHCP in the county but Devon County Council receives around 200 new referral requests each month.Benchmark data from 2021 shows that the county completed just 38.8% of EHCP assessments within the requisite 20 weeks against a national average of 59.9%.Jackie Ross admitted it was “a big job and a big ship to turn around” and added: “We are making efforts but we know we’ve got a long way to go. It’s not as fast as we would hope.”Donna Manson, who took over as county council chief executive in February this year, said it was using “smart targets” to monitor development and was “working with partners” including local health authorities.However Devon SEND Parents and Carers for Change representatives told the committee that not enough was being done and described the continuing difficulties faced by their families.Nicola Brewin said: “One of my children has been out of school since 2016, they are one year away from adulthood and have been unable to access any sort of education at all for the last few years. The situation is robbing our children of the support they need and the childhood they deserve.”Caroline Bolingbroke said: “I have a 13-year-old autistic child who has not been able to attend school for four years. Getting the support we need has been a huge fight. I was an education professional but now I’m at home with my child every day.”Astrid Harding added: “I feel outrage that our children and young people are missing out on their right to an education.”(From left) Nicola Brewin, Elaine Davis-Kimble, Caroline Bolingbroke and Astrid Harding from Devon SEND Parents and Carers for Change at County Hall on Tuesday.

Parent’s confidence in the system is in decline” and told the committee there were significant issues within national SEND services which made the task in Devon “doubly difficult”.Council opposition leader Julian Brazil, who sits on the children’s services scrutiny committee, disagreed. He said the wider context did not justify the extent of Devon County Council’s failings in SEND services provision.Comparing the county council’s Ofsted performance with neighbouring authorities, he said: “We’re surrounded by Cornwall: outstanding, Torbay: good, Somerset: good. Devon: inadequate. So why is it that we’re so bad?“We need to look at ourselves in the mirror and see that it’s here in Devon county that the problems lie and if we continue to make excuses and try to blame others then we will not make the improvements that we need.”Special educational needs and disabilities protest at County Hall in FebruaryCouncillor Andrew Leadbetter, who is responsible for children’s services in the county council cabinet, said: “We’re doing everything we can, there’s a huge amount of work going in to this.“We are stabilising things and working to move forward. I can assure you this is a real top priority for the council.”However Elaine Davis-Kimble of Devon SEND Parents and Carers for Change said the committee meeting had been “just more words”, adding: “Where is the empirical evidence? The improvement plan does not state how they are actually going to change things.”She said that families were still not being properly consulted: “Devon County Council are talking about working with their partners, and that’s great, but what about asking the people who are experiencing the fragmentation of services?“We need to get everyone together, we need focus groups, it needs to be a massive action plan.”Caroline Bolingbroke added: “We don’t have a voice in our children’s future, our children don’t have a voice. When is anyone going to listen to us?”"

"content" : "Exeter City Council has confirmed, in response to a freedom of information request, that it has never taken enforcement action against breaches of the ARTICLE 4 DIRECTION that is intended to prevent conversion of residential housing to HMOs in the St James area. It has also confirmed that it approved nine of fifteen applications for HMO conversion that have been made in the Article 4 direction area since it was introduced in January 2012.MATFORD BROOK ACADEMY, a new “state of the art” Ted Wragg Trust school for 1,450 pupils of all ages intended to serve the South West Exeter extension, is now not expected to open in September because of problems with the building foundations.A new EXMOUTH AND EAST EXETER parliamentary constituency will replace most of the current East Devon seat held by MP Simon Jupp. The changes will reduce the Exeter constituency’s size, moving its current eastern boundary westwards so all of the city’s Pinhoe, St Loye’s and Topsham council wards will fall in the new seat. Nearly 9,000 Exeter voters are affected. Simon Jupp will contest the new Honiton and Sidmouth seat that will also be created as part of the changes, which the government is expected to approve in the next four months.A £6.4 million government grant for heat decarbonisation at RAMM and the RIVERSIDE LEISURE CENTRE is to be spent on a Riverside roof upgrade and the replacement of gas-fired boilers with air source heat pump systems at both buildings.The £16 million MARSH BARTON railway station is to open on 4 July, six and half years later than planned.A £190,000 HEAVITREE AND WHIPTON ACTIVE STREETS scheme trial will begin in August for up to eighteen months, the first six of which will be a statutory consultation period during which residents and organisations will be invited to comment on the scheme. Four modal filters and three bus gates will initially be employed with the aim of reducing vehicular neighbourhood through traffic and increasing active travel in the area, in which around 17,000 people live. Changes based on consultation responses may be made to the scheme layout during the trial, in which case a further six month statutory consultation begins.City council planning committee chair Paul Knott used his casting vote to approve final plans for the 50,000m2 UNIVERSITY OF EXETER West Park redevelopment of its Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village student accommodation sites on the north west corner of Streatham campus. It will involve demolishing 30 buildings to provide more than 2,000 new student bedrooms, a net increase of nearly 1,500 on the current site provision, and will be ten times the size of the St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre. Furious local residents who say they have been stone-walled by the university during the three-year planning process were dismayed at the decision.The same planning committee meeting also granted Exeter Golf and Country Club permission to use 17 acres of privately-owned land that is part of LUDWELL VALLEY PARK as a golf driving range to replace their existing range on the other side of Rydon Lane, which will be developed for housing. A building and car park will be constructed on the greenfield site, which will remain inaccessible to the public, and conditions will restrict its use.Planning permission to rebuild the ROYAL CLARENCE HOTEL as residential flats with ground floor commercial units has still not been granted more than eight months after the city council approved the plans. An extended 26 May deadline to sign a s106 legal agreement requiring developer contributions to health, education and affordable housing elsewhere in the city was not met. An extended deadline for its completion has now been set at 14 July, six years and nine months after the hotel burnt down.EXETER CITY FUTURES is to be dissolved at the end of June following the final event in its £250,000 National Lottery-funded community engagement programme. The eight-year-old company, on which the city council has spent nearly £500,000, is responsible for the redundant Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan.A special meeting of Exeter Highways and Traffic Orders Committee (HaTOC) is being held at County Hall on Tuesday 20 June to discuss the HEAVITREE AND WHIPTON ACTIVE STREETS trial scheme following two public consultations and extensive community engagement. The scheme proposes modal filters and bus gates aimed at reducing vehicular neighbourhood through traffic and increasing active travel in the area, in which around 17,000 people live. An online petition encouraging councillors to approve the proposals is being hosted on the county council website.Proposals to vary a planning permission granted ten years ago to redevelop buildings on the corner of FORE STREET and WEST STREET that currently house Langans and Crankhouse Coffee to create a six storey block of thirteen flats with commercial units on the ground floor have been submitted to the city council for approval.The city council has granted planning permission for PINHOE COMMUNITY HUB, a new building at Station Road playing fields, for the second time following the lapse of the previous permission that was granted in February 2020.EXETER CITY LIVING is holding a public consultation on its Glasshouse Lane redevelopment plans, which have been revised following public feedback. The council-owned company is now proposing 24 housing units in a single four storey block on the south side of the site.Exeter Estates Holdings, a property development company that is controlled by Tony Rowe, CEO and chairman of Exeter Chiefs, has withdrawn its application to demolish ST THOMAS LIBARY and replace it with a block of thirteen flats following a public outcry in reaction to the plans.SOUTH WEST WATER owner Pennon Group has increased its shareholder dividend by nearly 11% to £112 million despite making a pre-tax loss of £8.5 million and being fined £2.15 million after pleading guilty to thirteen environmental offences committed across Devon and Cornwall. CEO Susan Davy said the company, which also owns Bristol Water, had “delivered improvements in environmental performance”."

"content" : "When electors living in Exeter’s Alphington ward voted in this year’s local elections they did not know that their councillor, Yvonne Atkinson, who was standing for re-election, had been investigated by the police and found in breach of the county council members’ code of conduct for failing to disclose a pecuniary interest.Had Devon County Council published the minutes of its March standards committee meeting in the week that followed the meeting, as is usual, many votes might have been cast differently. As it is, the county council did not publish them until four days after the election results were announced.And what it did publish is only a cursory summary of a fourteen month process involving Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police and the Crown Prosecution Service.The county council redacted all sixteen supporting documents containing 179 pages of correspondence that provide a complete account of what happened, including the decision not to prosecute, and which should be a matter of public record.It is standard practice for complaints against local councillors to be first examined in private to see whether there is a case to answer. This approach protects individual councillors where the evidence is weak or non-existent.It is only when council officers conclude that a councillor has almost certainly breached the code of conduct, usually in consultation with “independent persons” appointed to assist in such cases, that the issue is referred to a formal local authority standards committee to make a final decision.At this point practice between councils diverges. We conducted a survey to assess how approaches to standards committee openness vary between local authorities.We ensured a mix of council type by looking at county councils, district councils, metropolitan councils, unitary authorities and London boroughs, a total of 27 councils including all the district councils in Devon.We reviewed each council’s constitution, its complaints protocols and the minutes of recent standards committee hearings where available, then categorised them in three groups according to their degree of openness around standards committee hearings.Closed doors at County HallThe top group includes councils which default to holding standards committee hearings in public unless there are exceptional reasons for them taking place in private.Four of Devon’s second tier councils follow variations of this policy: Exeter City Council, East Devon and South Hams district councils and West Devon Borough Council.Another nine councils in our sample also do so: Maidstone Borough Council, Essex, Hampshire and Lancashire county councils, the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council, South Tyneside Council, which is a metropolitan district, and the unitary authorities in Dorset and the East Riding of Yorkshire.Two further councils have also adopted this policy but nevertheless tend to closed sessions: the London Borough of Haringey and Northumberland County Council.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            In the middle group are five councils which simply apply the normal rules about meetings privacy and make no presumption about standards committees either way.These are Mid Devon, North Devon and Teignbridge district councils, Chesterfield Borough Council and Cornwall Council, which is a unitary authority.Six further councils in our sample have also adopted this policy but nevertheless tend to closed sessions. These are Torridge District Council, Norwich City Council, Leicestershire County Council, Salford City Council, Wakefield Metropolitan District Council and Shropshire Council, a unitary authority.There was only one council in the bottom group in our survey, that has an absolute rule requiring private assessment and determination of councillor conduct complaints: Devon County Council."

"content" : "Yvonne Atkinson was already letting property on AirBnB when she was first elected to Devon County Council’s Alphington &amp;amp; Cowick division in May 2017, and continued to do so after first being elected to Exeter City Council’s Alphington ward in May 2019.She lives in a five storey grade-II listed Georgian town house in a conservation area near Belmont Park, on the opposite side of the city from the people she represents.According to her AirBnB listing there is a self-contained flat in the basement with “living room, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom”. A converted garage at the rear of the house is “like a studio apartment” according to one guest and has “all the amenities we would expect to have: cooking hob, microwave, toaster, kettle” with a “bed, TV set [and] shower room” according to another, although the “toilet is a bit noisy” according to a third.While planning permission was granted in May 2015 to replace the roof of this garage, and add garden-facing doors and a window, there is no record of permission for change of use or conversion to a living space on the city council’s website.Fast forward to a December 2021 meeting of Devon County Council, at which backbench motions on the role played by AirBnB and other holiday rentals in Devon’s housing crisis are being debated.It hears evidence that thousands of private landlords across the county are evicting tenants to turn what had been homes into highly profitable short-term lets, while exploiting tax loopholes that allow them to claim business rates relief instead of paying council tax.It also hears an estimate that more than 21,000 properties in the south west are claiming 100% business rates relief instead of paying an estimated £35.5 million in council tax each year.Yvonne Atkinson makes a case in support of AirBnB. She says it provides a “fantastic service to key workers and people who need short-term accommodation for working and studying” in Exeter and blames government policy for the region’s housing crisis instead.A complaint to the county council  follows, alleging that she has a personal interest in AirBnB rental property.Andrew Yendole, a county council solicitor who is temporarily acting as its monitoring officer while a new head of legal services is found, carries out a preliminary investigation into the complaint then refers the matter to Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police.An investigation ensues, which takes six months to complete. On receipt of the police findings in June 2022 Andrew Yendole refers the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service.A county council standards subcommittee is hastily convened, meets less than three weeks later, and refers the matter to the county council’s full standards committee in parallel with the Crown Prosecution Service consideration of the police investigation.Two months later, the Crown Prosecution Service writes to Andrew Yendole, apparently having decided not to seek a conviction through the courts.The county council’s new head of legal services, Maria Price, then takes over as monitoring officer in October 2022. By the end of the year a draft report has been written and Yvonne Atkinson is invited to comment on its contents.Three months later, in March this year, fifteen months after the complaint was made, the full county council standards committee meets.It confirms that Yvonne Atkinson did indeed breach the county council members’ code of conduct in relation to declaring her private interests, under paragraph 1.3f, and in relation to providing written notification to the monitoring officer of any disclosable pecuniary interest, under paragraphs 6 and 6.1.The committee resolves that Yvonne Atkinson “be required to issue a formal apology to the council”, that she undertake “relevant training” and that she “update her register of interests with immediate effect”.  Devon County Council members’ code of conduct  1.3 When acting in your capacity as a member or co-opted member of the county council —  (f) you must declare any private interests, whether disclosable or personal, that relate to your public duties and must take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest, including registering and declaring interests in a manner conforming with the procedures set out at Part 2 of this Code  6. You must, within 28 days of —  (a) this code being adopted by, or applied to, the county council; or  (b) your taking office as a member or co-opted member of the county council, whichever is the later, and annually thereafter, provide written notification to the county council’s monitoring officer of:  i) any disclosable pecuniary interest as defined by Regulations made by the Secretary of State, where the pecuniary interest is yours, your spouse’s or civil partner’s, or is the pecuniary interest of somebody with whom you are living with as a husband or wife; and  ii) any other personal interest laid down by the county council, as set out at paragraph 7 below; which will be recorded in the county council’s register of members’ interests and made available for public inspection including on the council’s website.  6.1 Within 28 days of becoming aware of any new interest or change to any interest already registered, you must register details of that new interest or change by providing written notification to the county council’s monitoring officer.Government guidance on the legislation from which the county council members’ code of conduct is derived, as are all such local authority codes, including Exeter City Council’s, is emphatic.Directly addressing local councillors, it says: “It is a criminal offence if, without a reasonable excuse, you fail to tell the monitoring officer about your disclosable pecuniary interests, either for inclusion on the register […] or to update the register […] or when you become aware of a disclosable pecuniary interest which is not recorded in the register but which relates to any matter that will be or is being considered at a meeting where you are present.”It adds: “It is also a criminal offence […] to participate in the business of your authority where that business involves a disclosable pecuniary interest.”It says the purpose of pecuniary interest disclosure is “to ensure that the public can have confidence that councillors are putting the public interest first and not benefiting the financial affairs of themselves or their spouse or civil partner from which the councillor would stand to gain.”The punishment? “If you are found guilty of such a criminal offence, you can be fined up to £5,000 and disqualified from holding office as a councillor for up to five years.”  Openness and transparency on personal interests  “It is essential that there is confidence that councillors everywhere are putting the public interest first and are not benefiting their own financial affairs from being a councillor.”  “It is a criminal offence if, without a reasonable excuse, you fail to tell the monitoring officer about your disclosable pecuniary interests, either for inclusion on the register if you are a newly elected, co-opted or appointed member, or to update the register if you are re-elected or re-appointed, or when you become aware of a disclosable pecuniary interest which is not recorded in the register but which relates to any matter; that will be or is being considered at a meeting where you are present, or on which you are acting alone.”  “It is also a criminal offence to knowingly or recklessly provide false or misleading information, or to participate in the business of your authority where that business involves a disclosable pecuniary interest.”  “If you are found guilty of such a criminal offence, you can be fined up to £5,000 and disqualified from holding office as a councillor for up to five years.”  Department for Communities and Local Government, September 2013So Devon County Council standards committee found that Yvonne Atkinson breached its members’ standards code by not telling its monitoring officer about a disclosable pecuniary interest.And such breaches amount to a criminal offence, according to the government, although this particular breach, which had been investigated by the police and referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, did not result in prosecution.Why, then, did this issue not come up during her campaign for re-election in Alphington three weeks ago?The answer is that Devon County Council did not publish the minutes of the March standards committee meeting until 9 May, four days after the results of the elections were announced.We have asked the county council monitoring officer repeatedly why the county council did not publish these minutes for nearly eight weeks after the meeting, despite it taking place eleven days before the pre-election period began on 27 March, but she refused to answer.We also asked her whether Yvonne Atkinson had issued a formal apology to the council and if so, when and what form it could have taken, as the county council meets today for the first time since the March standards committee meeting and so could not have heard her apology.And we asked her in what ways Yvonne Atkinson’s entry in the county council register of interests had been updated following the standards committee’s decision, as the only apparent change since February is the removal of her spouse. (It had already been changed, before the committee met, to include her pecuniary interest in income from her home.)The monitoring officer again refused to answer our questions. Instead, a county council PR officer said: “The monitoring officer has confirmed that this matter has been concluded and the subject member has complied with the sanctions in full.”To make matters worse, the county council has redacted all the March meeting supporting documents so we don’t yet know the specific details of the police investigation or the basis on which the Crown Prosecution Service reached its decision not to pursue a conviction.Nor do we have any more than a cursory summary of the proceedings of the county council standards committees that took part in this process.We are, nevertheless, entitled to all the relevant information under the Freedom of Information Act and have already submitted appropriate requests, the responses to which we will use to publish a detailed report in due course.Despite Devon County Council’s propensity for standards committee secrecy, the public interest in these documents and the special information access rights afforded to the purpose of journalism all but guarantee disclosure.

Since the minutes of the March meeting have been published, Yvonne Atkinson has been promoted from the city council backbenches, where she spent most of last year.(She did, however, begin sitting on the city council’s strategic scrutiny committee in the autumn. The Devon Housing Task Force that was created “to tackle the flight to AirBnB and holiday rentals” after the December 2021 county council meeting was discussed with her present in November.)She has been appointed chair of the city council strategic scrutiny committee and sits on both its customer focus scrutiny committee and its secretive scrutiny programme board. The principal purpose of all three is to hold the council’s decision-makers to account to ensure the successful functioning of local democracy.Meanwhile at the county council’s annual meeting this afternoon she is to be appointed to six committees - four more than she sat on last year - apparently without making a formal apology to the council first.We asked her whether the publication of the county council standards committee decision before the local elections might have influenced their outcome in Alphington where she was the sitting city councillor and standing for re-election.We also asked her nineteen other questions about the circumstances surrounding the investigation. She failed to respond to any of them.CORRECTION – 14 AUGUST 2023Paragraph 24 of this story originally said: “And that breach amounted to a criminal offence, according to the government, which had been investigated by the police, although the Crown Prosecution Service did not pursue a conviction through the courts.”Following a complaint it was changed to: “And such breaches amount to a criminal offence, according to the government, although this particular breach, which had been investigated by the police and referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, did not result in prosecution.”This change was made to correct the false impression that the government’s view was that this particular breach of the Devon County Council members’ code of conduct amounted to a criminal offence, rather than that the government’s view is that such breaches in general amount to a criminal offence, which is the meaning that was intended."

"content" : "The University of Exeter has released figures for the number of students based at Exeter campuses in response to a sequence of freedom of information requests submitted by Exeter Observer. They confirm that its published student numbers have consistently and significantly understated the true picture for more than twenty years.The figures show that there were between 7,500 and 12,000 more students in the city each year between 2000-1 and 2021-22 than the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) student numbers published by the university and reported to the Higher Education Statistics Agency.(FTE student numbers combine full-time and part-time students into a single total used for planning educational provision, not accommodation, although the university does not explain this anywhere on its “facts and figures” page.)Last year the university reported that there were 27,276 FTE students based at its Streatham and St Luke’s campuses but a freedom of information request confirmed that there were actually 39,450 students based at its Exeter campuses that year, a difference of more than 11,500.Other freedom of information requests combined with a range of sources including University of Exeter annual reports and financial statements and Higher Education Statistics Agency data have provided a complete picture covering the past 22 years, with the exception of 2004-5.For eleven of these years the difference between the published and true numbers was more than 10,000. In all but one year it was at least 8,000. The largest discrepancy was 12,149 in 2007-8.The significant fall in numbers this year follows two years in which university places were oversubscribed as a result of teacher assessment-driven grade inflation following the cancellation of A-level exams in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. This led to a surge in students gaining undergraduate places at universities with more competitive entrance requirements.A fall in Exeter undergraduate numbers was expected after OFQUAL intervened to deflate grades to their pre-pandemic levels over two years, affecting the 2022 and 2023 results. The University of Exeter accordingly made fewer offers for entry this year, although more than half of the drop in this year’s numbers was accounted for by a fall in postgraduate students.These changes nevertheless do not account for the sudden convergence of the university’s published FTE numbers with the true figures obtained via freedom of information requests.Until this year its FTE numbers were, at first, consistently lower than even the true number of full-time undergraduates, then consistently lower than the true number of full-time undergraduates and postgraduates combined, entailing that they were false in both cases.This is the first year in which its FTE numbers exceed the combined true full-time numbers and account for a portion of the part-time numbers, as should have been the case in every previous year. It is only since the true numbers have been made available via freedom of information requests that the university has altered its published figures in this way.While the university can choose what to publish on its website and in its annual reports, its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 are legally binding. It is a criminal offence to alter or conceal information held by public authorities (including the university) with the intention of preventing disclosure following a request for the information under the Act.The university also provides these FTE numbers to the city council to inform its planning policies related to Exeter student accommodation despite them being of little use for this purpose.To estimate the extent to which Exeter’s residential housing stock is occupied by students the council has instead relied on student council tax exemption records as part of a matrix of faulty premises, inaccurate information and miscalculated projections on which it has been basing its student accommodation policies.However the Office for National Statistics concluded in 2021 that council tax records cannot be relied on for this purpose after it found that only 12% of students live in addresses solely occupied by students and around 30% live in addresses that appear to be made up of students and non-students. It also found that only half of all student addresses have any indication on council tax that students live there.The new Exeter Local Plan is soon to replace the city’s existing student accommodation policies but the outline draft version on which the council held a public consultation last autumn has nothing to say about these issues.The council’s current policies rely on the construction of Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) to mitigate the impact of university expansion on the city’s housing stock, but no evidence has ever been provided as a basis for this policy, while the growth in university student numbers has been consistently underestimated and misrepresented.To make matters worse, many of the privately-provided student accommodation blocks that have sprung up across the city in recent years are estimated to be only around 70% occupied, leaving 58% of Exeter’s university students living in the city’s residential housing stock.    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.    Subscribe freeNeither council tax records nor PBSA occupancy estimates are sufficiently accurate to provide a basis for the effective student accommodation policies the city needs in response to the university’s impact on the city’s residential housing stock, should the council wish to adopt some.We therefore asked the university, again citing freedom of information legislation, to tell us how many students lived in university- and privately-provided PBSA during the 2021-22 academic year.These figures could be combined with its other freedom of information responses to determine how many of its Exeter-based students lived in private residential housing stock that year too.We believe around 29,000 students occupied around 8,250 dwellings in 2021-22 which could otherwise have been used for residential housing by local people, but we know that the university knows exactly how many and think that it should come clean on this too.We began our pursuit of this information last August. The university has been by turns evasive, defiant and silent in response.As a result, after Information Commissioner’s Office investigation, our public interest quest to publish the truth about the university’s impact on the city’s housing supply has led us to a First-tier Information Rights Tribunal where a judge will decide the case sometime in the next few weeks."

"content" : "Exeter Labour’s vote share fell 1.5% in this year’s local elections but it won five fewer seats than last year, apparently because the Liberal Democrats and Greens finessed their electoral strategies to address the failings of the First Past the Post electoral system to which Labour’s national leadership still clings.Because the party only had to win two Exeter wards to retain overall control of the city council, its net retention of seven seats at these elections leaves council leader Phil Bialyk in control of a majority block of 25 votes among 39 council seats, as last year.So when appointments to the council’s committees for the coming year were made at Tuesday’s annual council meeting, alongside the appointment of the Lord Mayor and his deputy, there was no surprise that Labour councillors were again appointed to all thirteen committee chairs.Nor has much changed on the council’s ostensibly decision-making Executive committee. Bob Foale has replaced Amal Ghusain, who left the council after a single term, and Duncan Wood has been sent back to leisure services, switching with Josie Parkhouse who takes over responsibility for the council’s climate crisis response.Apart from some minor portfolio alterations, the rest of the Executive stays put.Exeter City Council annual meetingMore significant changes have taken place elsewhere. The council’s Governance Review Board has been unceremoniously scrapped: prematurely as it has yet to report the outcome of its work over the past year and worryingly considering the council’s governance woes.At the same time Phil Bialyk has quit the planning committee, and removed Emma Morse from it too, after failing to follow Local Government Association guidance that neither should sit on it for several years.Exeter Observer first challenged the council on its approach to planning committee appointments in 2020 when, extraordinarily, eight Executive members occupied nearly two-thirds of its seats.We did so again after last year’s local elections when he moved six of the Executive members elsewhere but retained his seat and kept Emma Morse in the chair, then again last month, when he openly admitted he was choosing to ignore the guidance.The following week he led the charge against an application to develop a site just 160 yards from his house from his seat on the committee before apparently, finally, seeing the light. We applaud the eventual decision, but not the facility with which it was made.Exeter City Council 2023-24 committee appointments and portfolio holder briefsUnfortunately the council leader’s approach to scrutiny hasn’t kept even this pace.Instead of opposition councillors chairing the council’s key scrutiny committees, as at other local authorities such as Devon County Council, councillors from his own party occupy these seats. Matt Vizard will continue in one while Yvonne Atkinson will take the other, raising eyebrows all round.These committees are charged with protecting the council from Executive overreach by providing a crucial check and balance on its actions: they are much less likely to fulfil this function effectively when led by members of the same political party as the people they are supposed to be holding to account.Worse, the council’s secret Scrutiny Programme Board, which fundamentally thwarts the purpose of local authority scrutiny, continues to meet this year, allowing council directors and Executive members to interfere in scrutiny decision-making in which they should take no part.The board will be chaired this year by Naima Allcock with a built-in Labour majority provided by Matt Vizard and Yvonne Atkinson.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Since it first met in 2019 it has enabled senior officers and the council’s chief executive to direct, defer and avoid scrutiny of the council’s climate crisis response, its relationships with companies such as Exeter City Living and major schemes such as St Sidwell’s Point, among other things.The council’s chief executive even attended to present details of his own proposals for scrutiny of Exeter Development Fund, a financing scheme intended to expose council property assets to private investors that was being promoted by a company of which he was also CEO at the time.They spelled out who would be invited as witnesses, what they would talk about and what the outcome of the scrutiny sessions would be.This board has also enabled the council leader, the Executive committee and individual portfolio holders to direct scarce council scrutiny resources towards maintaining the status quo, prioritising issues that do not require the interrogation and deliberation that scrutiny is intended to involve and so preventing their use for this purpose.This is how the Standing Overview Group that should have been created nearly a year ago after scrutiny councillors voted to inaugurate it to examine the city-wide response to climate change has not yet met, but Executive member Duncan Wood’s Plant-Based Task &amp;amp; Finish Group met four times within a few weeks of being proposed despite its unquantifiably small impact.This approach to scrutiny could not be more different to the model proposed by the council’s external auditor – the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee – before which witnesses called to give evidence fear to appear.The key characteristics of this committee, according to the auditor? That “it is chaired by a member of the official opposition and its members, of all political parties, are required to demonstrate robust challenge”."

"content" : "This year’s local elections saw Labour remain in control of Exeter City Council with the same number of seats – 25 – that it held when the ballots opened yesterday morning. But underneath the surface changes in the city’s political landscape that began last year were confirmed by this year’s results and look set to continue.For the second year running a Labour newcomer won in Topsham, previously an unshakeably safe Conservative seat. While last year’s Tory incumbent lost after serving a single term, this year Rob Newby, who had represented the ward for twenty years, fell in the face of the Labour advance. Matthew Williams won.However the Liberal Democrat’s Adrian Fullam – who previously held St Thomas for twelve years and was city council leader for two – reclaimed the seat from Labour. He extended a huge swing that brought council deputy leader Laura Wright within 44 votes of losing last year despite defending a majority of nearly 25% of the vote, the largest margin in the city.Whether these changes reflect demographic shifts in these parts of the city as newcomers arrive, the local Labour party’s lengthening record or the national party’s direction of travel across the political spectrum is not clear.At the same time, the Green Party’s Andy Ketchin decisively beat Labour’s Carol Whitton, who leads the Labour group at County Hall from her St David’s &amp;amp; Haven Banks seat, to take Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s at his second attempt.The Greens also held Heavitree, where Carol Bennett won a by-election last year after Labour’s Chris Buswell resigned. 10% of this year’s vote in the ward went to anti-Low Traffic Neighbourhood campaigner Lucy Haigh whose support appears to have come largely from Conservative and Labour voters to the Greens’ advantage.Opposition leader Diana Moore also comfortably held St David’s, firmly establishing the ward as a Green stronghold, while Michael Mitchell held Duryard &amp;amp; St James for the Liberal Democrats. This leaves the Progressive Group with six Green and three Liberal Democrat councillors, one more than last year, having successfully defended four of its seats.The group became the official opposition after last year’s elections, replacing the Conservatives. The Greens are now the second largest party on the council and have overtaken the Conservatives on ballot share too, although Labour still dominates city-wide with nearly twice as much support as the Greens.Despite this, and the national picture at these elections, Labour won just seven of the thirteen Exeter seats contested this year. It only increased its voter numbers in two, both of which it lost: St Thomas and St Loye’s, where the party hoped to take the outgoing Lord Mayor’s safe Conservative seat but failed to do so despite a dip in Conservative support. Alison Sheridan won.In every other ward except Duryard &amp;amp; St James, where exactly 791 voters backed the party this year and last, Labour vote numbers fell on a turnout that was 3.67% lower than last year.When ballot share is used to compare results (see methodology note), the party’s position looks a little better in Alphington, where it consolidated control over the ward, which has the smallest electorate in the city and so its lowest victory threshold, and in Duryard &amp;amp; St James, St Loye’s and St Thomas, in none of which it won.Labour flatlined in its Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton and Priory strongholds where it has very large leads. Executive member Ruth Williams was re-elected in the former with the largest majority (and the lowest turnout) in the city and Jane Begley returns to represent the latter after losing in St Loye’s in 2021.The party also flatlined in Pinhoe, where it has established a clear majority over the past four years despite the seat previously being a Conservative-Labour marginal, where newcomer Mollie Miller was elected, and its ballot share fell by more than 5% in Exwick, council leader Phil Bialyk’s seat, where Susannah Patrick was elected after coming third in Heavitree last year behind the Greens.Pennsylvania, where Labour’s vote peaked in 2021 and was already falling, no longer looks safe for the party as Lizzie Woodman increased the Green Party’s ballot share in the ward by 11.28%, by far the largest ballot share change between the parties across the city. Martyn Snow won.The Greens also significantly increased their vote share in St David’s, where Diana Moore received a larger share of the vote than the landslide she won when she was first elected in 2019, and in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s.Conservative ballot share fell in every ward while the Liberal Democrat performance was more mixed across the city.Vote redistribution was also inconsistent, with all four main parties benefiting in some wards but losing out in others. Overall the Conservatives have the most to worry about, followed by Labour, and the Liberal Democrats not so much. Exeter Green Party has reasons to be cheerful.The First Past the Post electoral system is partly responsible for Labour’s woes: it is no longer working for the party in Exeter as it has previously, apparently because the Liberal Democrats and Greens have responded to its counterproductive consequences by finessing their electoral strategies.In 2016, when all Exeter’s seats were exceptionally elected at the same time, Labour won in 30 of 39 wards with 47% of the vote while the Liberal Democrats won a single seat with nearly 15% of the vote and the Greens won no seats at all despite receiving more than 14% of the vote.Last year Labour won twelve of seventeen seats with 46% of the vote but this year won seven of thirteen seats with 44% of the vote. At the same time the Liberal Democrats won first one then two seats with 13% and 12% of the vote, and the Greens won three seats on each occasion with 21% and 22% of the vote.These changing fortunes are even more apparent, as is First Past the Post’s impact on the Conservatives, when non-voting electors are included in the analysis.Last year both Liberal Democrat and Green votes translated into more city council representation than Conservative votes, although Labour still benefited disproportionately from the system. This year 14,000 Labour votes won seven seats, while 11,000 Liberal Democrat and Green votes won five seats, and 6,300 Conservative votes won just one.Methodology noteAs the 2016 city council elections were held using the multiple non-transferable vote system each voter was allowed to cast up to three votes which were not ranked in any order of preference.Because not all voters cast all three of their votes a precise vote share for individual candidates cannot be derived from the recorded results.This also applies to two individual ward elections held since then, in Priory in 2019 and Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton in 2021, when voters were invited to cast up to two votes to elect two councillors at the same time, and in Exwick, Heavitree, Pennsylvania and Priory last year, when two councillors were also elected in each ward.Calculating comparative party performance in Exeter City Council elections over time is further complicated because the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats stood aside for independent candidate Jemima Moore in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s in 2019, then formed a cross-party alliance which led to them standing aside for each other in a total of six wards across the city in 2021.Consequently, a proportional share of the ballots cast for the leading candidate in each party in each ward in which the party stood has been used to compare party support in the principal city council elections that have taken place since 2016.We believe that this is the best available method to enable statistically meaningful year-on-year comparisons between the major parties in the city. Mid-year by-elections have been excluded.Candidates from other parties, as well as independent candidates, have also stood in each of these elections.UKIP contested most, but not all, of the city’s wards in 2016 and again in 2019, but not in 2018. The Women’s Equality Party also contested city council elections in Duryard &amp;amp; St James in 2018, 2019 and 2021. And this year two independents and a Reform UK candidate stood.These smaller parties and independent candidates have been grouped together to simplify comparison. Where more than one non-major party stood in a multiple non-transferable vote election the best performing candidate has been included in the analysis."

"content" : "Council leader Phil Bialyk has sat on Exeter City Council’s planning committee continuously since he was first elected twelve years ago. He also chaired the committee from 2011-2016.When he took over as council leader in May 2019 he continued to sit on the committee despite Local Government Association guidance that council leaders should not do so “to avoid any appearance of bias or having ‘predetermined’ views when making a decision on a planning application or policy”, and to ensure that “decisions on plan making and planning applications are undertaken, on behalf of communities, in a fair, impartial and transparent way”.He then appointed Emma Morse to the post of Executive portfolio holder for city development and planning in May 2021, and made her chair of the planning committee at the same time, despite the same guidance saying that councillors holding this role should also not sit on the planning committee, let alone chair it.Exeter Observer had by then already challenged the council on its approach to planning committee appointments, and we did so again following last year’s local elections when Phil Bialyk cemented Emma Morse’s role as planning committee chair.At last month’s city council meeting the council leader was asked why Exeter City Council does not follow the guidance. His answer boiled down to “I choose not to”.So when the planning committee met the following Monday, at County Hall as the civic centre’s meeting rooms were being used for the local elections, the council leader took his seat as usual.Exeter City Council planning committee meets at County Hall, 24 April 2023The first planning application on the agenda was for a development of six houses at Newbery car breakers yard in Redhills.The council leader led the charge against it. He was first to speak and took part repeatedly, expressing apparently strongly-held views about the application during the increasingly heated discussion that followed. He also proposed the motion to refuse it.What he did not make clear, despite saying he knows the road on which the development site is located, is that he lives 160 yards away. Emma Morse was also apparently aware that he lives beside the site, referring to passing his house there when regularly driving back to Exeter from Cornwall.The council leader’s house is so close to the site that it appeared in an aerial view included in the council planning officer’s presentation on the development proposals. According to Google Maps it is just two minutes’ walk from one to the other.Two minute pedestrian route from The Cottage, Nadderwater to Newbery car breakers, Redhills. Contains satellite imagery © 2022 CNES/Airbus, Getmapping plc, Infoterra Ltd &amp;amp; Bluesky, Maxar Technologies.A glance at the council leader’s register of interests confirms his pecuniary interest in his property at Whitstone Cross. Should this not, then, have prohibited his involvement in a planning decision about Newbery car breakers yard?The law governing the disclosure of pecuniary interests introduced in the 2011 Localism Act – not long after the council leader’s first election – and extended the following year was intended to have limited scope, partly because it is a criminal offence to break it.Notwithstanding the reasonable view that the council leader should not take part in a planning decision concerning a development so close to his house, the government’s intention was that doing so would not constitute a criminal offence because it intended situations like this to be addressed by local authority codes derived from considerations of where the public interest in such matters lies.Exeter City Council has just such a code, which it refreshed at its April meeting to keep it in line with the Local Government Association guidance on which it is based.Exeter City Council members’ code of conductParagraphs eleven and twelve (highlighted) appear to confirm that the council leader should have declared his interest in the Newbery car breakers yard planning application.It affects his financial interest or well-being to a greater extent than it affects the financial interests of the majority of inhabitants of Exwick, the ward he represents, and a reasonable member of the public knowing all the facts is likely to believe that either or both would affect his view of the wider public interest in the application.Exeter City Council’s constitution also contains a code of conduct that specifically relates to planning decisions, rather than covering the conduct of councillors more widely. This says: “It is essential that both members and officers identify situations where a conflict of interest may arise and that any such interest is declared prior to consideration” and cites living in proximity to a development site as a case in point.It was to comply with these rules that Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell, who also sits on the planning committee, declared his interest in a planning application for a student accommodation block on Howell Road, near his home at committee meetings in February and March.In both cases he neither participated in the debate nor voted on the decision, but did speak from the floor as a member of the public as his interest in the application was not a disclosable pecuniary interest.Similarly, Green Party councillor Diana Moore, who is also a planning committee member, recused herself from consideration of a student accommodation and co-living application on the Heavitree Road police station site in February because of a disclosable pecuniary interest in a nearby property.It may be that the council leader can keep his seat on the planning committee with his Executive portfolio holder for city development and planning in the chair, as he is not required by law to apply Local Government Association guidance about probity in planning decisions, although one might think that striving for impeccable ethical standards is a responsibility entailed by his role.But surely, at least in this case, the conduct and planning codes that the city council has adopted, also based on Local Government Association guidance, apply to him just as they do his opposition colleagues."

"content" : "On 1 March we reported that the city council, at its annual budget-setting meeting on 21 February, had cut the budget for its 2023-24 Exeter grants programme to just £15,000 from the £425,000 it had allocated to the scheme when it was first introduced in 2019.The programme, comprising ward grants of up to £500 for one-off hyperlocal projects, small grants of up to £3,000 for city-wide projects or events and large grants of up to £30,000 for community building, refurbishment or equipment costs, was intended to have a long-term impact on inequality, health and individual and community resilience across the city.We said that the council’s 2023-24 budget provided nothing for ward grants, small grants or community centre running costs and published a table listing hundreds of grassroots groups and community organisations that have previously depended on these grants to cover essential costs.We included a bar chart to make clear how precipitous the 96.5% fall in Exeter grants programme budgets had been over the previous four years.Fast forward seven weeks to the April meeting of the city council. Labour councillor Martin Pearce, who is responsible for the Exeter grants programme, was asked to clarify the council’s position on ward grants this year.He said: “I just want to reiterate here and now that there is £39,000 allocated to the ward grants for next year contrary to some of the misinformation that is being published all over the city by various other organisations.”He added, turning to face the Exeter Observer reporter sitting at the press table: “Hopefully that will be reported by the opposition propaganda, sorry, the Exeter Observer in a full statement, rather than just taking two words from the middle of a sentence and changing the meaning of a fairly lengthy contribution for probably the seventeenth time.”Readers who would like to ensure we are not misquoting him can view his contribution to the meeting in full below.Martin Pearce speaking at Exeter City Council’s 18 April meetingWhat could have prompted Martin Pearce to traduce Exeter Observer during a public meeting of the city council in this way?Our story reported that the council “cut the community grants budget by nearly a quarter in its second full year of operation, then lopped off another £118,000 last year before reducing it to a rump of just £15,000 in the 2023-24 budget that the council agreed last week”.This was true when the story was published, was derived from the primary sources linked to in the statement and other council financial records, and remains true now. It unambiguously cites the 2023-24 budget passed by the council on 21 February, which was subsequently published on its website and remains unchanged.Exeter City Council 2023-24 budget bookShortly after Martin Pearce made his remarks, the city council meeting addressed the minutes of the April Executive committee meeting at which the council’s finance director presented his quarterly review of its general revenue budget.This reported an underspend on the 2023-23 Exeter grants programme and said, referring to the neighbourhood portion of Community Infrastructure Levy receipts that have been the programme’s source of funding since the end of its first year: “The grants budget for 2023-24 is currently paused and will be confirmed following the accrual of further neighbourhood CIL receipts to be received based on the planning forecasts.”At the meeting, Green Party councillor Diana Moore asked why the community grants programme had been paused and was now deferred, but instead of answering her question at the meeting council leader Phil Bialyk said she would subsequently receive a written response from the council’s finance director.When the response appeared, thirteen days later, it said: “As members are aware there is a shortfall in neighbourhood CIL funding. As a result, grants approvals were paused to ensure the council’s obligations in 2023-24 could be met. Ward grants programme will commence in the municipal year.”Written responses to questions raised at Exeter City Council’s 4 April Executive committee meetingAs neither report nor written answer specified any change to the 2023-24 community grants budget, we looked to a scrutiny meeting held the previous week at which Martin Pearce was asked to clarify the position on ward and any other grants.He said ward grants would “continue as they are, currently, for the next financial year, so there’s £39,000 allocated” and that the council had “some certainty on the funding position for building grants” although he did not say whether any money had been allocated to this budget or, if so, how much.He also said the position on the “the small, large and strategic grants that we’ve been fortunate to be able to pay out to a countless number of organisations to the tune of several million pounds over the last few years” was “unknown at this point”, adding “what we are almost, you know, entirely certain of is that there will be other grant funding coming forward through the course of the year, but what we can’t say is how much that will be and when it will be”.He also mentioned what he described as a “great voluntary community sector conference” at which those present “were all put at ease that there is a guarantee that the ward grants will continue”, adding that they “were encouraged that if they ever hear other members making statements they’re concerned about or unsure about to get in direct contact with portfolio holders or senior management board members as they’re the people who can speak for the council on all matters”.Readers who would like to ensure we are not misquoting him are can view a verbatim transcription of his lengthy response to the question here.Working Together VCSE and ECC presentation led by Martin Pearce on 15 MarchAs Martin Pearce’s account did not explain when, how, by whom or from what source the £39,000 budget allocation had been made, or provide any substantive information about any other aspect of the 2023-24 Exeter grant programme budget, we wrote to the council’s finance director to seek clarification.He confirmed that two unpublished decisions had been taken in private under rules which allow virements – in-year transfers of funds from one part of a budget to another – to take place up to a maximum value of £40,000 without council approval. (All other amendments to the council’s budget must be made at public meetings of the full city council).One such decision, to allocate £27,000 of unbudgeted income to the 2023-24 community buildings budget, had been taken on 21 March. Another, to allocate £39,000 of unbudgeted income to the 2023-24 ward grants budget, had been taken on 24 March.He also confirmed that the source of unbudgeted income that had been used was not neighbourhood CIL but a refund of VAT charged against income from the council’s leisure services, in a departure from the council’s existing policy, and that neither decision would be reported to the council until 18 July.We published our story about the council’s 2023-24 budget decisions on 1 March. The revised bar chart shows the impact of these virements on the 2023-24 community grants budgets.We’re happy to report the finance director’s clarification in full. And we’re delighted if our reporting of the decision to decimate the community grants budget put the council under pressure to find some money down the back of the sofa to reverse some of its cuts. Although we’re no less surprised that the money is to be taken from the council’s leisure services, which are losing £2 million a year.But the community grants budget is still £344,000 lower than it was when it was introduced by the council leader as “an exciting and bold step forward for the council in our endeavours to support community groups and organisations as they continue to work together on local projects that help make Exeter such a great place to live”.And a fortnight has now passed since Martin Pearce’s attempt to smear Exeter Observer during a public meeting of the city council but we have yet to receive an apology.We make no apology, in any case, for drawing attention to these budget cuts: it is independent journalism’s job to hold power to account in the public sphere. And we’re confident that doing so will reinforce our reputation, not put it at risk.Nor do we think Exeter’s Labour politicians should be surprised that Exeter Observer calls out their actions: they have dominated the city council for eleven years, making numerous decisions that urgently require greater public scrutiny.

Subscribe freeMartin Pearce may instead have put the council at risk, speaking as he has during the pre-election period, which this year began on 27 March.During this period the council should “not publish any material which, in whole or in part, appears to be designed to affect public support for a political party” according to the Local Government Act 1986 as amended by the Local Government Act 1988 and developed in the government’s local authority publicity code of practice.The code’s scope includes “any communication, in whatever form, addressed to the public at large or to a section of the public”. The city council’s meetings, broadcast live then subsequently made available for streaming and download, as they should be to make its decision-making processes more transparent, fall within it.Lord Mayor Yolonda Henson, chairing the April council meeting, certainly thought he was pushing it, as she made clear when she rebuked him and other Labour councillors for using the meeting to make political points when he had finished speaking.As an Executive portfolio holder Martin Pearce speaks on behalf of the council, a point he stressed in his remarks. The council should be able to rely on him, as it should all other councillors, not to put its reputation at risk or undermine public trust in its actions by behaving this way during its public meetings.The council meeting then moved on to the next item of business: the minutes of an audit and governance committee meeting and the approval of a Member’s Code of Conduct, updated to include new principles about treating others with respect. It passed unanimously.            Martin Pearce said: &quot;Yeah, sure, thanks Tony, er, Councillor Wardle, sorry, erm, the situation with the ward grants is that they will continue as they are, erm, currently, for the next financial year, so there&#39;s £39,000 allocated, £3,000 per ward and it&#39;ll be, er, as I say, as it is currently, erm, the other grants, we, we, we&#39;ve got some certainty on the funding position for, erm, erm, building grants, so community centres that, that get some support from the city council, that&#39;s in place.        The small, large and strategic grants that, that we&#39;ve been fortunate to be able to pay out to a countless number of organisations to the tune of several million pounds over the last few years is, is an unknown at this point, erm, in 2019 the city council took a really innovative and bold, erm, step to sort of fund some of these grant funding, erm, streams through the community infrastructure levy, erm, and the nature of that legislation means that you cannot spend it until you&#39;ve got it, erm.        You know, we&#39;ve got, erm, a sizeable pot currently but most of it, almost all of it, has been, erm, allocated and ringfenced for other purposes, erm, so there aren&#39;t, erm, additional receipts at the moment, as we sit here now, that we can say there&#39;s going to be X amount guaranteed for, erm, small grants, large grants or [inaudible] strategic grants during the coming financial year, erm, somebody might have paid an invoice in the last hour so that, that might have changed, erm, you know, since I, I last got an update, erm.        But what we are almost, you know, entirely certain of is that there will be other grant funding coming forward through the course of the year, but what we can&#39;t say is how much that will be and when it will be. We certainly hope that, erm, as, as, you know, construction takes place, erm, and CIL becomes, er, liable to be levied from developers in the city, erm, that we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll get the receipts in.        There is building going on, yeah, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s no action, and there&#39;s no potential, erm, receipts to come forward, you know, we all see developments going on, erm, some of you sit on the planning committee, you know, we all see that, erm, developments on occasion get given approval, erm, and that they will start, erm, construction and then there&#39;ll be certain elements of the infrastructure levy will become due at different stages of that, erm, construction process, erm, but as we sit here right now I, I can&#39;t say what they&#39;ll be beyond the ward grants which we&#39;ve managed to guarantee, erm, there, there is that funding in the pot, erm.        So you know, I, I understand why you&#39;ve asked the question because I too have heard some of the rumours that are going around that they would be stopped, erm, but we had a, a great, erm, voluntary community sector, er, conference a couple of weeks ago where, er, forty plus partners in the room, it just so happened to be on the day that there was a school strike so we, we got a flurry of late apologies because people had issues in trying to, er, get themselves there on the day.        Erm, but they were all put at ease, erm, that there is a guarantee that the ward grants will continue, erm, and when we reminded them, that members present there that day, that portfolio holders and council officers are the only people that can speak to council policy, erm, directly, other people can talk about their views on council policy but they are not stating council policy so, they, they were encouraged that if they ever hear other, erm, members making, erm, statements they&#39;re concerned about or unsure about to get in direct contact with portfolio holders or senior management board members as they&#39;re the people who can speak for the council on all matters, erm.&quot;                    Close            "

"content" : "EXETER CITY COUNCIL member’s allowances and expenses came to a total of £409,000 in the year to March 2023, with council leader Phil Bialyk claiming £28,400 and receiving gifts and hospitality at Sandy Park.The city council has agreed to allow four music concerts at SANDY PARK STADIUM in June with up to 15,000 people in attendance, tickets for which have already been on sale for two months. Its planning committee heard accounts of extreme anti-social behaviour by visitors attending events at the venue as well as other adverse impacts on local residents and imposed traffic and parking, noise, litter and opening and closing time restrictions on the concerts.An Ofsted monitoring report on DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL CHILDREN’S SERVICES, the fifth since the local authority was judged inadequate in January 2020, has found that the “quality of social work practice across Devon remains inconsistent”. Inspectors found “pockets of better practice” and “some positive changes” but said that weak management oversight, insufficient challenge and poor care planning all continue to cause problems. It also said a high turnover rate in agency social work staff, who make up more than 40% of the workforce, is having an adverse impact.MAGDALEN ROAD is expected to reopen on Saturday 27 May following pavement widening and its permanent conversion to one-way traffic at a cost of £1 million.TOPSHAM LIBRARY is to move to a smaller upstairs space following a proposed rent increase for its current ground floor accommodation at Nancy Potter House. The library will close on 12 June and reopen on 27 June, and will be accessible via a lift.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has promoted its ranking in a “Good Growth for Cities” accountancy firm report despite the report finding that Exeter’s economy is expected to contract significantly during 2023. The council neither mentions that it is the third worst performing city among the 50 surveyed nor provides a link to the report, which the council leader welcomed.Industry regulator Ofwat has launched an enforcement investigation into SOUTH WEST WATER leakage performance reporting, the accuracy of which has been in doubt following a November 2022 Ofwat assessment of the company’s progress in this area.A Higher Education Policy Institute report has found that the 2021-22 cohort of 1,285 first-year Exeter INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS brought £140.7 million in net benefits to the UK economy, primarily in the form of tuition fees, accommodation provision and living costs and visitor expenditure. Exeter international student numbers have increased by 20% in the past two years.PENINSULA TRANSPORT has published a South West transport decarbonisation strategy which hopes to reduce the 4.4 million tCO2e of greenhouse gas emissions the region’s transport currently generates each year. Current policy is only expected to address one quarter of the total by 2050.An application to construct a 167-bed seven storey co-living block in SUMMERLAND STREET is expected to reignite controversy around Exeter City Council allowing the use of its land to provide “student accommodation in all but name”.DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL has approved a £1.7 million 700 metre two-way segregated cycling scheme in Rifford Road to form part of the E12 north/south cycle route between Honiton Road and Ludwell Lane.EXETER CITY COUNCIL is inviting reactions to its proposed amendments to its existing  planning policy restrictions on the conversion of residential housing to multiple occupancy dwellings, frequently lived by students, near the university. There are exhibitions from 1-7pm on Wednesday 7 June at Exeter Guildhall, 1.30-7pm on Tuesday 13 June at Newtown Community Centre in Belmont Park and 1-7pm on Tuesday 20 June at St James Church Hall in Mount Pleasant Road. Printed copies of its plans will also be available at the Civic Centre and in libraries until the consultation concludes on 3 July.The UNIVERSITY OF EXETER is inviting local residents to express their views on the future of Lower Hoopern Valley. Potential uses for the 38 acre mix of pasture and woodland through which Taddiford Brooke passes are a carbon sequestration and storage facility and a research resource which may involve the construction of buildings on the site. The consultation runs to 26 May.A public consultation on a draft DEVON, CORNWALL AND ISLES OF SCILLY CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY which will attempt to minimise the impact of climate change on the South West peninsula is under way until 30 June. The full draft strategy is here. Publication of a revised, final version of the plan is expected in August before partnership organisations will be invited to endorse it during the autumn, four and a half years after Devon County Council convened the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group to “act now to tackle [the] climate emergency”.The 2023 LOCAL ELECTIONS took place on 4 May. 55 polling stations across Exeter opened from 7am to 10pm to enable the city’s electors to choose thirteen people to represent them on the city council, one in each electoral ward. For the first time voters were required to produce an accepted form of photo ID to cast their ballot in person.A large fire broke out at EXTON ROAD RECYCLING CENTRE in Marsh Barton on 29 April which took fire crews three hours to extinguish. Four appliances were needed to deal with the fire including an aerial ladder platform. Its cause was the accidental ignition of four tonnes of mixed recycling waste in a lorry trailer."

They also owned Bampfylde House, an important Elizabethan town house on Bampfylde Street in the centre of Exeter.Politmore House was occupied by the family until 1920, then became a school before becoming an NHS hospital which closed in 1974.

View gallery here.EXETER IN BRIEFThe UNIVERSITY OF EXETER has submitted plans for a six acre 1.07MWp solar farm and substation beside Belle Vue Road and alongside Duryard Valley Park which include fencing off part of the publicly-accessible greenspace.SOUTH WEST WATER has been fined £2.15 million and ordered to pay £280,000 costs after pleading guilty to thirteen environmental offences committed between July 2016 and August 2020 across Devon and Cornwall, the largest fine imposed for such offences in the region. The company allowed toxic chemicals to escape into waterways on several occasions, causing significant environmental damage. A single spill at Kilmington led to the deaths of thousands of fish in the River Axe, including protected species. It also pumped raw sewage into rivers and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.A new development of 1,435 homes has been approved at Cobden on the eastern edge of CRANBROOK by East Devon District Council.A major review of EXETER CITY COUNCIL governance, which has already been postponed six times and was not expected to address the issues it raises until July, making it nine months late, has now disappeared from the council’s forward plan altogether.Exeter COST OF LIVING data shows that wages fell in real terms by 6.6% over the year to March 2023, the biggest fall bar one of all 62 cities and large towns included in the Centre for Cities tracker.

"content" : "Exeter’s electors go to the polls next Thursday to elect thirteen people to represent them on the city council, one in each electoral ward.Our 2023 Exeter local elections guide covers who’s standing where in the city, wards to watch and what the results might be. It also covers the wider context, new voter ID requirements, the impact of using First Past the Post in Exeter local elections.The Conservatives, Greens, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are each fielding thirteen candidates. In ten of the city’s thirteen electoral wards there is a four-way contest between these parties.In addition an independent candidate is standing in Exwick who last year stood for the now-dissolved far right For Britain Movement, and another independent candidate is standing in Heavitree on an anti-Low Traffic Neighbourhood platform.There is also a candidate for Reform UK, a right-wing populist party that was previously known as the Brexit Party, standing in St Thomas.Local party manifestos are available for the Conservatives, Greens, Labour and the Liberal Democrats as is a complete list of the 55 candidates that are standing.Exeter City Council electoral wards. Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2019There are 39 seats on Exeter City Council and currently nearly 90,000 registered voters in the city. Each of thirteen electoral wards of between 6,300 and 7,800 electors is represented by three councillors.A third of the seats, one in each ward, is normally contested in each of three consecutive years, with county council elections held in the fourth year. Each city councillor normally serves a four year term.Exeter’s wards have been arranged this way since boundary changes prompted the exceptional election of the whole council at the same time in 2016.This year six city councillors are not standing for re-election, including current Lord Mayor Yolonda Henson who has sat on the council for a total of 39 years after first being elected in 1979. Her run was interrupted three times: in 1983-84, 1996-98 and 2014-16.Four Labour councillors are standing down. Executive member Amal Ghusain in Priory, former deputy leader Rachel Sutton in Exwick, Trish Oliver in Pinhoe and Hannah Packham in St Thomas.Independent Jemima Moore is also standing down in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s. She has served a single four-year term after being elected in a wave of protest around the council’s plans to redevelop the Clifton Hill sports centre site as luxury housing.Labour is defending seven of the thirteen seats that are being contested this year, the Conservatives and Greens two each and the Liberal Democrats one.However Labour only has to win in two wards to stay in control of the city council, a position it has been in since 2012, making Exeter what the Electoral Reform Society calls a “one party council” with “weak electoral accountability” which greatly increases the likelihood of cronyism, corruption and spending decisions which offer poor value for public money.Labour strongholds Labour has five Exeter electoral strongholds where the party won by large and increasing margins last year.Yvonne Atkinson is expected to retain her seat in Alphington despite the ward being the worst represented at public council meetings in the city, and Executive member Ruth Williams is expected to retain hers in Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton. Both have just completed inaugural four-year terms.Martyn Snow, who was elected for the first time last year after coming second in Pennsylvania, which was electing two councillors following the death of deputy Lord Mayor Ian Quance, is also expected to benefit from Labour’s recent performance in a seat which was a two-way Conservative/Liberal Democrat marginal until the 2016 boundary changes.The Greens did not stand in the ward in 2021 as part of an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats, despite polling 24% of the vote in the previous contest. Last year they returned to campaign in the ward and overtook the Conservatives’ ballot share.Susannah Patrick, who came in third place last year in Heavitree behind the Greens, is standing this year in Exwick for Labour.Jane Begley, who vacated her seat in Pennsylvania to contest the ballot in St Loye’s last year after her council meetings attendance fell sharply in the second half of her four year term, is standing for the party in Priory this year.Both are also expected to win by clear margins.Key battlegrounds Exeter’s key electoral battlegrounds are more difficult to call.Labour deputy council leader Laura Wright nearly lost her St Thomas seat last year despite defending a Labour majority of nearly 25% of the vote, the largest margin in the city.Adrian Fullam, who previously held the seat for the Liberal Democrats for twelve years and was city council leader for two, came within 44 votes of reclaiming it for his party. He faces Labour newcomer Deborah Darling following incumbent Hannah Packham’s decision to give up the seat, which she won from Adrian Fullam in 2015 and held for eight years.After standing aside for Independent Jemima Moore in 2019, the Green Party increased its vote share in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s by 30% in 2021 against long-term Labour incumbent Richard Branston, who held on by a margin of 126 votes after 23 years on the council, then maintained its position last year against another Labour incumbent, Matt Vizard.The Green Party’s Andy Ketchin hopes to take the seat this year following Jemima Moore’s departure. He is up against Labour’s Carol Whitton, who is Devon county councillor for St David’s &amp;amp; Haven Banks and leads the Labour group at County Hall.The Greens also surged in Heavitree in 2021, coming within sixteen votes of winning after increasing their vote share in the ward by 26%, before winning two seats there last year.Catherine Rees was elected for a four-year term. Carol Bennett, who was elected for a one-year term following the resignation of Labour’s Chris Buswell, is standing for re-election next week. She faces another Labour newcomer, Gemma Rolstone.The Liberal Democrats’ Michael Mitchell, who came top in our analysis of councillor meetings attendance this year, is defending his Duryard &amp;amp; St James seat.Labour frustrated Liberal Democrat hopes of three wins in a row there in 2021 by increasing its vote share by nearly 15%, but the Liberal Democrats regained more ground than they had lost to keep Kevin Mitchell, who was first elected twenty years ago, in place in 2022.Whether Labour’s 2021 result was an anomaly caused by a combination of the Greens not fielding a candidate and the Women’s Equality Party taking 7.5% of the vote, slightly more than the margin by which Martin Pearce won, remains to be seen.Conservative skirmishes The biggest surprise at last year’s local elections was the Conservative loss to Labour in Topsham. The party had held all three seats in the ward comfortably for more than twenty years. Newcomer Joshua Ellis-Jones beat Keith Sparkes by more than 250 votes to the astonishment of all involved.The task of demonstrating that 2022’s result was a one-off for Labour falls to Conservative Rob Newby, who has held the seat since 2003. Labour’s Matthew Williams must think he is in with at least half a chance.At the same time the Conservatives hope to regain a foothold in Pinhoe, which their candidate Cynthia Thompson previously represented for a total of eight years between 2008 and 2019.Pinhoe was a close two-way race between Labour and the Conservatives for more than a decade. In 2010 Labour won in the seat by just four votes. In 2015 it lost by six votes in a by-election. In 2016, when all three seats were elected at the same time, Labour took two and the Conservatives one, with less than a hundred votes separating the three winning candidates.In 2019 Labour won by fifteen votes. However its vote share increased significantly in 2021 then again last year following a council decision to allocate £1.3 million to a community hub in the ward.The Conservatives also hope that their candidate Alison Sheridan will prevail in St Loye’s, where Lord Mayor Yolonda Henson is standing down, and which has previously been a safe seat for the party.Labour’s Olwen Foggin stood down in Heavitree to contest St Loye’s in 2021 but lost to Conservative Anne Jobson, who has since become Conservative group leader. Last year Peter Holland comfortably saw off Labour’s Jane Begley, increasing the Conservative vote share.However the party faces energetic competition in the form of Labour’s Jake Bonetta who, unusually, already sits on East Devon District Council, where has represented the residents of Honiton St Michael since a July 2021 by-election, when he became both the first Labour councillor to sit on the East Devon authority for more than twenty years and also its youngest councillor at 19.He also sits on Honiton Town Council, to which he was elected two months earlier, and stood for election to Devon County Council in the same year, when he significantly increased the Labour vote share in Feniton &amp;amp; Honiton.Green redoubtWhen Green Party councillor Diana Moore won in St David’s in 2019 she polled the largest number of votes of any candidate standing in any ward, the largest margin of victory across the city and the city’s largest vote share.The Greens then won again in the ward in the subsequent 2021 city council elections when Amy Sparling was elected (the 2020 poll was postponed because of the pandemic) and again last year when Tess Read won the party’s third seat in St David’s.The ward is the most complex in Exeter, including many of the city’s ex-industrial areas as well as its tourist hotspots, with student accommodation blocks alongside high deprivation levels. Significant development is also planned there as part of the Liveable Exeter scheme.The two other seats the Greens took from Labour last year in Heavitree meant the Progressive group of Green, Liberal Democrat and Independent councillors replaced the Conservative group as the official city council opposition.The group is defending four of its eight seats this year: were it to lose all of them and the Conservatives retain their current five, the Conservatives would regain their official opposition status. Among them Diana Moore, as opposition leader, is standing for re-election next week.Voter IDAcross the country nearly 8,100 councillors are to be elected in nearly 5,000 wards in 152 district councils, 32 metropolitan boroughs and 46 unitary authorities at this year’s local elections, the largest since 2019. Nearly 26,000 candidates representing 153 political parties have been nominated to stand as well as 1,880 independents.146 councils will elect all their councillors and 84 (Exeter among them) will elect one third of their councillors. There will also be elections in all eleven councils in Northern Ireland on 18 May which have been delayed by two weeks to avoid clashing with the coronation because of the extra time Northern Ireland’s Single Transferable Vote electoral system takes to count.These will be the first elections contested under the Elections Act which requires voters in England to produce photo identification to vote in person at a polling station. Accepted forms of photo ID include UK passports, driving licenses and some concessionary travel passes.The new regulations apply at local government elections in England, police and crime commissioner elections, parliamentary by-elections and parliamentary general elections that are held after 5 October this year.Electoral Commission data shows that there was not a single proven case of in-person voter impersonation, the justification for the introduction of the restrictions, at last year’s elections.Two million UK voters are thought to lack suitable photo ID. They were able to apply for a free Voter Authority Certificate either via a government website or their local council until 5pm on Tuesday. Only 83,319 people applied by the deadline, 288 of which are registered to vote in Exeter.Exeter City Council is intending to place staff at the entrance to each polling station to check whether prospective voters have an accepted form of photo ID. If not, they will be told they will not be able to vote without one and invited to return before the polls close with valid ID if they can.Rachel Maclean, a junior government minister, has repeatedly refused to say whether the number of voters turned away from polling stations because they lack approved ID will be recorded, enabling assessment of the impact of the changes.Expectations that voters would register to vote by post this year in response to the restrictions have been confounded, at least in Exeter where just over 15,000 people are now registered to vote this way, an increase of only 300 on last year.TurnoutTurnout in recent English local elections averages around 36%, although it rises to around 64% when a general election is held on the same day.Many factors contribute to low participation in elections, including decreasing trust in politicians and the political system, the timing of polls and the First Past the Post electoral system, which has numerous disadvantages and is the object of active electoral reform campaigns.None of the elections held in Exeter since its current ward boundaries were introduced in 2016 have involved more than 43% of the city’s voters.Fewer than 17% of Exeter’s then 93,000 registered electors voted for Labour in 2021’s city council elections, while nearly 22% voted for other parties. Labour nevertheless won eleven seats and the other parties three between them.Last year Labour’s vote share shrunk (along with Exeter’s registered electorate, which fell by 1,500) but this time the party won twelve seats.The skewed seat distributions that result from First Past the Post elections in Exeter is also revealed by excluding non-voting electors from the assessment.At the past five elections Labour has secured between 36.5% and 47.5% of the ballots cast but has, in every year except 2019, won at least 70% of the seats.First Past the Post doesn’t even guarantee that the party which wins the most votes will win the most seats: in the 1951 UK general election Labour famously polled nearly a quarter of a million more votes than the Conservatives but won 26 fewer seats, with the Conservatives subsequently forming the government.It also means some seats change hands so rarely that they become “safe” for particular parties, rendering voting preferences there all but irrelevant.Around 60% of Parliament’s 650 seats are in this position, although recent national political realignments have begun to reduce this proportion.It favours large, well-financed, incumbent political parties which are capable of consistently high campaign spending across all electoral areas and are incentivised to resist changes to an electoral system which helps them win power with minority support and helps fund them when in opposition.

Methodology noteAs the 2016 city council elections were held using the multiple non-transferable vote system each voter was allowed to cast up to three votes which were not ranked in any order of preference.Because not all voters cast all three of their votes a precise vote share for individual candidates cannot be derived from the recorded results.This also applies to two individual ward elections held since then, in Priory in 2019 and Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton in 2021, when voters were invited to cast up to two votes to elect two councillors at the same time, and in Exwick, Heavitree, Pennsylvania and Priory last year.Calculating comparative party vote shares in Exeter City Council elections over time is further complicated because the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats stood aside for independent candidate Jemima Moore in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s in 2019, then formed a cross-party alliance which led to them standing aside for each other in a total of six wards across the city in 2021.Consequently, a proportional share of the ballots cast for the leading candidate in each party in each ward in which the party stood has been used to compare party support in the principal city council elections that have taken place since 2016.This is the best available method to enable statistically meaningful comparisons between the major parties in the city. Mid-year by-elections have been excluded.Candidates from other parties, as well as independent candidates, have also stood in each of these elections.UKIP contested most, but not all, of the city’s wards in 2016 and again in 2019, but not in 2018. The Women’s Equality Party also contested city council elections in Duryard &amp;amp; St James in 2018, 2019 and 2021.These smaller parties and independent candidates have been grouped together to simplify comparison. Where more than one non-major party stood in a multiple non-transferable vote election the best performing candidate has been included in the analysis."

"content" : "Attendance at public council meetings, including committees, is not the only measure of councillor commitment: other meetings held behind closed doors and residents’ casework can take up much of a councillor’s time.Nevertheless it is at public meetings that council decisions are taken, at least formally, so councillor attendance at such meetings is an important measure of commitment to their electors alongside their less public activities, and is essential to the council’s democratic legitimacy.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Exeter City Council publishes retrospective meeting attendance records for those of its committees which report their proceedings. (Several do not despite the Information Commissioner’s guidance.) These show how many meetings councillors were expected to attend and how many of those they did attend.We have examined the attendance figures for public city council meetings held between 16 May last year, the day before the annual council meeting when councillors are appointed to committees, and 25 April this year, the day after the last public meeting before this year’s local elections. (Our 2021-22 attendance analysis is here.)We have assessed attendance rates – the number of meetings attended as a proportion of expected attendances – for individual councillors, by political party and by electoral ward.Councillors are likely to miss a meeting through ill-health or family demands from time to time, so a couple of points either way in the attendance rates should not be seen as significant.It is where a pattern of attendance or non-attendance is evident that it is possible to infer councillor commitment to discharging democratic responsibilities by participating in formal council meetings.Six councillors, representing all four political parties, managed 100% attendance records. Labour’s Phil Bialyk, Barbara Denning and Martin Pearce (all Executive members), the Green Party’s Diana Moore, Liberal Democrat Michael Mitchell and Conservative Peter Holland.Michael Mitchell had the highest public meetings workload in this top group, attending 28 meetings during the past twelve months. He was closely followed by Peter Holland on 27 and Diana Moore and Phil Bialyk, the council leader, both on 26.Martin Pearce attended 23 meetings and Barbara Denning nineteen.Yolanda Henson, the Lord Mayor, attended all nine full council meetings she was expected to chair. Because the Lord Mayor does not sit on committees she has been excluded from subsequent analysis.At the other end of the scale, councillors who attended fewer than 70% of the meetings at which they were expected include Labour’s Bob Foale and Trish Oliver, Independent Jemima Moore and – in botom place with a 57.7% attendance rate – the Conservatives’ former leader Andrew Leadbetter.Andrew Leadbetter also sits in the county council cabinet from where he oversees children’s services, and so faces some serious challenges. Whether his city council electors in Topsham consider his county council responsibilities a fair excuse for his low levels of participation in city affairs is not something we shall discover until May next year when his current term ends.Attendance rates by political party – excluding the two independents, who are not aligned with one another – are calculated as the sum total attendances of all councillors in each of the four parties as a percentage of expected attendances.The Liberal Democrats and the Greens come out on top with respective attendance rates of 96.2% and 93.5%. Labour, with by far the largest number of councillors, scored 85.7%.The Conservatives put in a poor performance in aggregate with a collective attendance rate of 81.6% that was dragged down by a low turnout from Andrew Leadbetter and Rob Newby, who is standing for re-election next week in Topsham.Assessing attendance rates by ward clearly shows that some parts of the city are better-represented than others.These rates present the sum of the attendances of the three councillors in each of the city’s thirteen electoral wards as a percentage of expected attendances.The residents of Duryard &amp;amp; St James received the best representation at public meetings in 2022-23 from their two Liberal Democrat and one Labour councillor, who together attended 97.3% of the 75 public meetings at which they were expected.The three Greens who represent St David’s came a close second with a collective attendance rate of 96.9% of 65 meetings and St Loye’s two Conservatives came third by attending 96.6% of their 58 public meetings (excluding the Lord Mayor’s attendance at nine full council meetings).The worst represented electoral wards in the past twelve months were Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s, which has two Labour and one Independent councillor who together attended 76.7% of their 73 meetings, and Topsham, whose two Conservative and one Labour councillor together made it to 76.2% of their 84 meetings despite Labour’s Joshua Ellis-Jones’ personal attendance rate of 96.4%.Alphington received the wooden spoon. Its three Labour councillors, Bob Foale, Steve Warwick and Yvonne Atkinson, who is standing for re-election next week, together attended only 71.8% of the 71 public meetings at which they were expected.EDITOR’S NOTEFollowing publication of this article, Trish Oliver wrote to explain that she had not attended several council meetings at which she was expected in order to protect a member of her family who is immunocompromised and so at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 infection despite vaccination.She also mentioned the Forgotten Lives campaign that advocates for the protection of people in this position and support for those who are shielding them.As the council does not record the reasons for councillor absence from meetings it is not possible to verify the reasons for the absences of the 33 councillors who did not attend all the meetings at which they were expected during the year.Given the legitimacy of health- or family-related reasons for absence, it appears that the council could consider recording reasons for councillor absence from meetings in its attendance data.We have written to the director responsible for council democratic services to raise this issue."

"content" : "Devon County Council is expected to undertake a year-long “root and branch” review after admitting “serious, material, well-evidenced” failures in its corporate governance.A report by its legal and finance directors describes the council’s position as “very challenging” and identifies “a number of fundamental issues” prompting an “urgent need” for a high-priority review.It cites failing Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) provision and children’s services as major factors while warning that its financial viability is at risk and admitting that its stakeholders lack confidence in its ability to address these challenges.Clouds gather over County HallThe report follows criticism of the county council’s corporate governance by the children’s minister and the imposition of an independent commissioner to hold the council to account over its failure to improve its children’s services, which have been regularly rated “inadequate” by Ofsted over the past decade.In December the county council was told that its children’s services were considered the “third or fourth worst in the country” and would be taken into special measures and taken over by an independent trust if improvements were not made.It also follows “relentless institutional failings” in SEND children’s services provision over the past five years which led to a major protest at County Hall in February.SEND protest at County HallThe report also warns that the county council faces a “material threat of a section 114 notice” because of its growing cumulative overspend on SEND services provision, which has risen to nearly £130 million and is projected to increase to £153 million by March next year, more than the county council has in its financial reserves.A section 114 notice, which Devon County Council’s finance director would be compelled to issue if the county council’s expenditure was likely to exceed its resources and it was unable to address the deficit, would be an effective declaration of bankruptcy.It would be a last resort resulting in a loss of financial control by the county council’s leadership and would result in a 21 day suspension of non-statutory spending while the county council sought to get its house in order.Several section 114 notices have been issued recently by councils across the country including Thurrock, Croydon and Slough.They have led to the imposition of council tax increases of 10% in Thurrock and 15% in Croydon while government-appointed commissioners are compelling Slough Borough Council to sell property assets worth £600 million to resolve its financial difficulties.

The county council subsequently confirmed that it had been mistaken, and that the review recommendations would be instead presented for approval at the annual meeting of the county council on 25 May."

"content" : "Exeter City Council is expected to adopt a new food policy on Tuesday. Brainchild of Labour’s Duncan Wood, who spearheads the council’s response to climate change, the policy has taken months to prepare since he proposed it last year.Its aim was “to ensure food provided at internal council meetings would be plant-based” and that “all council run external sites including leisure centres, cafes and restaurants have plant-based options available”.In addition to council meetings it would apply to event catering at the Corn Exchange and Guildhall and council cafes at RAMM, the Matford Centre, the ISCA centre and St Sidwell’s Point.However there are comprehensive exclusions in the resulting policy smallprint. It doesn’t apply to private hire at any of these venues, or to leased concessions (which include the cafe at RAMM), or to vending machines or drinks of any kind.An accompanying report admits that only “limited” catering takes place at council venues in any case and the handful of events that are catered at the Guildhall are already 80% vegetarian. The cafe at St Sidwell’s Point already offers plenty of vegan and vegetarian options too.St Sidwell’s Point cafeThe new policy is also wrapped and stuffed with weasel words, offering plenty of wriggle-room for council cafe and catering managers. All its provisions are qualified and so are largely unenforceable.It invites council venues to “aim” to offer half plant-based and half dairy, meat and fish menu options, while fish should be sustainably-sourced and ultra-processed products avoided “where possible”. The “aim” should be to prioritise local suppliers, and purchasers should do the right thing “wherever practical”, selecting certified organic foods “where practical and cost effective”.As there is no budget for the policy, “cost effective” means cafe and catering managers offsetting higher prices by buying less food to sell, or councillors cutting spending elsewhere to compensate.And the policy does not apply to council meetings at all, as observed by the council’s deputy leader at a meeting of Labour councillors last week. She pointed out that the council hasn’t provided food at its meetings “for a good two years”.The policy’s contribution to the climate crisis is harder to quantify. Apparently it “should have a small positive impact” on the council’s carbon emissions, but no figure is provided.RAMM cafeThis is a striking omission, as the primary focus of Duncan Wood’s policy proposals was “the effect dietary choices can have on individual carbon footprints”.It seems the “Plant Based Task and Finish Group” of five councillors and three council officers he led, which met four times in February and March to examine them, was neither able to determine their impact potential nor gather any information about the scale of council food buying at all.It also appears to have been hamstrung by ignorance of sustainable food production. An invited group of local farmers and NFU and BFU representatives had to point out “the values and benefits of mixed farming” in preference to relying on petrochemical fertilisers despite the noisily hostile reception the council’s plant-based policy announcement had already received the previous month.The BFU said: “The whole issue of using plant-based foods flies directly in the face of sustainability. Many alternatives to meat consumption are based on products grown on land on the other side of the world.”East Devon MP Simon Jupp went further: “I think what Exeter City Council is doing here is a load of virtue-signalling nonsense and it’s also a big let-down for local farmers. Meat and dairy farmers surround Exeter. They produce amazing food. The city council should be celebrating that.”The council task force did eventually divine the lay of the land. Its resulting report cites a Public Health England healthy eating guide which includes meat, fish and dairy products, and the council now supports regional food strategies which emphasise the value of mixed farming approaches.These include University of Exeter research on the potential for the South West public sector to strengthen food supply chains by buying from local farmers and the Devon Food Partnership’s Good Food Strategy, which is connected to the Devon Carbon Plan. Neither is “plant-based”.Public Health England healthy eating guideThe city council seems to have been wrong-footed by the publication of the Devon Good Food Strategy despite the Devon Food Partnership launching more than two years earlier and its monthly steering group meetings involving a wide range of regional representatives.Victoria Hatfield, the city council’s net zero lead, said the strategy “came out just after we’d written the policy”, and that her team “will be making contact with the Devon Food Partnership”.She also seems to have understood that the council might encounter difficulties introducing a plant-based menu in at least one of its cafes, saying that putting the new policy together had been “quite challenging” because of variations between the council venues to which it applies.A council risk assessment puts this differently, identifying “a risk of losing a competitive position if the unique nature and location of some of our public facing catering venues are not taken into account”.While it does not say so, this must surely be a reference to the cafe at the Matford Centre, the council-owned home of Exeter’s busy livestock market which is expected to make a profit of nearly half a million pounds next year and at which many of the county’s farmers regularly take tea.The council, or at least its climate change portfolio holder, also seems not to recognise the limited scope of the new food policy compared with the decarbonisation challenges it faces, let alone the colossal scale of the whole city’s carbon footprint.Six months before Duncan Wood proposed his plant-based policy the University of Exeter calculated the city council’s 2020-21 corporate greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon footprint of council catering or cafes did not figure in its rigorous analysis of 50 emissions categories across all three scopes.It did, however, identify bigger fish to fry. The construction of St Sidwell’s Point alone was responsible for around 16,000 tCO2e of the council’s 53,000 tCO2e emissions that year. All 4,800 of the city’s council houses would have to be comprehensively retrofitted to offset this impact. Only 420 have been completed so far: the rest will take another twenty years at current delivery rates, which have been temporarily boosted by large government grants.As retrofitting the council’s housing stock is likely to take even longer, perhaps its climate policy lead could instead focus on this target, which would meaningfully improve the city’s carbon emissions position as well as the lives of its tenants by reducing their fuel bills.He could also prioritise related problems including the need to decarbonise the rest of the city’s 56,000 residential dwellings, not to mention its non-residential buildings, or addressing the fact that the council’s Passivhaus programme is expected to substantially increase its carbon footprint.Exeter faces a long list of challenges that Duncan Wood could chew on which have much greater climate crisis mitigation potential than council food policy. Unfortunately we may be out of luck: he said he found the council’s catering and cafes setup “incredibly complex”.Meanwhile the council’s newly-employed net zero officers, who understand both the big picture and the detail, are to be tasked with developing impact indicators to monitor his new food policy and delivering ten other paltry recommendations of his “Plant Based Task and Finish Group”."

"content" : "Devon County Council is proposing homelessness services spending cuts as part of £30 million of annual adult social care budget reductions despite rising numbers of rough sleepers and the likelihood that doing so will cost more than the savings it aims to make.Although its 2023-24 budget includes an 8.8% increase in adult care expenditure, spending will now be directed to statutory services at the expense of those provided by Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) organisations.In Exeter these include homeless prevention services provided by Exeter YMCA, Gabriel House and Sanctuary Supported Living that offer practical support to anyone aged 18 or over who is homeless, at risk of becoming homeless or threatened with homelessness.The county council’s finance director described its approach as a “re-prioritisation” when its outline budget plans were announced in January. Then a week after passing its budget in February it opened public consultations on plans to cut the funding of five adult social care services, including a £1.5 million adult homelessness prevention service contract that supports 250 people.Rough sleeping at Exeter GuildhallThe county council describing publication of its plans as “consultations” may be a misnomer.While James McInnes, the Conservative county council cabinet member who is responsible for adult social care, said: “We’ll make no decisions until after the consultation and until after we’ve had time to fully digest what people tell us”, the council actually has very little room for manoeuvre.Local authorities - unlike central government and NHS trusts - are compelled by law to set a balanced budget which cannot include a deficit and are locked into the total once it has been decided.Nor do the homeless prevention consultation documents the county council provides offer sufficient information for people to make an informed response for it to digest.They do not consider any other means to keep delivering the service and the justification for the proposed cuts is unhelpfully stated as: “The council is committed to supporting vulnerable adults across the county and focussing on its statutory responsibilities to ensure that individual eligible social care needs are met”.An impact assessment is available elsewhere but there is no link to it from the consultation page.The county council’s plans to cut adult homelessness prevention service funding have been widely criticised, with several Exeter service providers pointing out that are likely to lead to increased public expenditure rather than the savings the council aims to make.Exeter YMCA, which currently receives £157,000 a year from the county council to provide homelessness prevention services, says the council could end up having to spend £924,000 a year on additional adult social care costs as a result of cutting its funding.The responsibility for housing the 100 young people the YMCA helps with tailored support each year, as they come out of homelessness or dangerous situations and establish themselves, would otherwise fall on Exeter City Council, and would have additional impacts on the police and NHS.A recent report on Exeter City Council’s updated homelessness prevention strategy confirmed that any capacity reductions among its homelessness service partners would expose it to increased levels of statutory homelessness and have a significant impact on its finances.Exeter homelessness charity St Petrock’s, which does not receive county council funding but will also face additional service delivery pressures if the cuts go ahead, has highlighted their likely impact.Its chief executive Peter Stephenson tweeted: “I’m deeply worried about Devon CC’s plan to end funding for Devon’s homelessness services. Rough sleeping in Exeter has roughly doubled in twelve months, but we could see it double again if this goes ahead. The result is unthinkable.”Exeter Homelesseness Forum letter to Devon MPsWhile central government funding policies are partly responsible for Devon County Council’s financial problems, it has forfeited much sympathy in the way it presented its proposed adult social care cuts. As Peter Stephenson put it: “They are consulting the public, but haven’t told the public they are being consulted.”The county council’s statement justifying its proposals appeared the day after the consultations went live. But it does not provide a link to the consultation pages so anyone who wants more detail has to search to find it.When the county council’s health and adult care scrutiny committee met to review the consultations last month its members commented on the need for better information and up to date impact assessments of the proposals which also assessed their wider costs.A motion to pause the consultations to get more information on delivery costs and the likely financial impact of the cuts on other agencies was moved by Independent county councillor Jess Bailey, but was defeated.When Exeter city councillors requested an update on the situation last week from Labour’s Martin Pearce, who is responsible for the city council’s homelessness prevention services, he said the county council had given neither Exeter’s homelessness prevention VCSE organisations nor the city council any warning of its social care cuts plans.He said the city council, Exeter’s homelessness service providers and other key stakeholders were working together to try to influence the county council, if not to stop the cuts, then to at least phase the withdrawal of funding to avoid a cliff edge.He declined to be drawn on whether county councillors who had approved the consultations were aware of their ramifications or simply ill-informed. He did say that service providers had reported that contract monitoring by the county council had effectively ceased, with a consequent loss of information flowing back to the council.

Subscribe freeExamination of county council reports during pre-budget consultation meetings tends to support the view that councillors were ill-informed. Specific services were not singled out for cuts but warning flags were nevertheless plainly visible.One such report said: “As we reiterate and refocus our promoting independence approach through our pending refreshed vision, and strategies, more people will be supported and enabled to need less or no commissioned care, replaced by VCSE and other support in their communities.”Another said: “There is a very substantial risk that if the preventative work of many VCSE organisations ceases the burden on frontline statutory services will increase even more.”It added: “During austerity and during the pandemic there was a reliance on the sector to ‘plug the gaps’ and support early intervention. However this cannot be provided at the same cost as previous years. Public sector needs to be aware that VCSE cannot continue to mitigate their service reductions.”This report, a county council budget impact assessment, was considered at no fewer than three meetings: the county council budget scrutiny meeting on 30 January, the county council cabinet meeting on 10 February and the full county council budget setting meeting on 16 February at which all councillors are expected to be present.At the same time a county council assessment of the likely impact of homeless prevention service cuts, which was published a week before the cabinet and full council meetings, identified increased homelessness and rough sleeping, job losses and adverse impacts on individual safety, health and wellbeing as probable consequences of the cuts.Devon County Council’s adult homelessness service cuts consultation runs until 19 April."

"content" : "The UNIVERSITY OF EXETER has submitted plans for a six acre 1.07MWp solar farm and substation beside Belle Vue Road and alongside Duryard Valley Park which include fencing off part of the publicly-accessible greenspace.SOUTH WEST WATER has been fined £2.15 million and ordered to pay £280,000 costs after pleading guilty to thirteen environmental offences committed between July 2016 and August 2020 across Devon and Cornwall, the largest fine imposed for such offences in the region. The company allowed toxic chemicals to escape into waterways on several occasions, causing significant environmental damage. A single spill at Kilmington led to the deaths of thousands of fish in the River Axe, including protected species. It also pumped raw sewage into rivers and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.A new development of 1,435 homes has been approved at Cobden on the eastern edge of CRANBROOK by East Devon District Council.A major review of EXETER CITY COUNCIL governance, which has already been postponed six times and was not expected to address the issues it raises until July, making it nine months late, has now disappeared from the council’s forward plan altogether.Exeter COST OF LIVING data shows that wages fell in real terms by 6.6% over the year to March 2023, the biggest fall bar one of all 62 cities and large towns included in the Centre for Cities tracker. The think tank found that Exeter workers were on average £144 a month poorer in January 2023 than the previous year as local wage levels have more in common with the north of England than the south.Work at MARSH BARTON RAILWAY STATION is now complete but an opening date will not be set until regulatory approval for its use is granted. The station was originally scheduled to open in December 2016.When asked at April’s meeting of EXETER CITY COUNCIL why it does not follow Local Government Association guidance which explicitly advises against the council leader and planning portfolio holder sitting on the planning committee to avoid conflict of interest risks, council leader Phil Bialyk said: “I choose not to follow the guidance”. Both he and Emma Morse, Executive portfolio holder for city development and planning, continue to sit on the committee, which she also chairs.Dozens of postal voting forms completed with the names and addresses of Exeter voters have been left on a garden wall by local EXETER LABOUR election canvassers. The data breach occurred as the national party put the sensitive personal data of millions of local authority voters at risk via a security flaw in its telephone canvassing database.The window to register to vote for this year’s Exeter LOCAL ELECTIONS closes at midnight on Monday 17 April. Thirteen city councillors among 55 candidates will be chosen to serve four year terms at the local elections on Thursday 4 May. All those who wish to vote in person will, for the first time, be required to show photo ID. The deadline for postal vote applications is 5pm on 18 April.DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL began works to reintroduce two-way motor vehicle traffic and reduce pedestrian capacity between Paul Street and Northernhay Street in Queen Street on 17 April.Junior doctors at the ROYAL DEVON NHS TRUST are striking over pay from 11-15 April alongside British Medical Association colleagues across the country. Emergency, critical, neonatal and other care services will continue during the strike and patients should attend scheduled appointments unless they hear otherwise.A woman was sexually assaulted in LUDWELL VALLEY PARK between 2-4pm on Sunday 9 April.

It claims the library plans to relocate but Devon County Council and service provider Libraries Unlimited both say they intend to stay in the building.The EXETER WORKS employment advice hub that replaced the Princesshay tourist information office has closed in favour of online-only service provision. The county council Devon Youth Hub service, which was previously co-located with the service, has moved to Exeter Library.EXETER CITY COUNCIL will not now be able to increase council tax charges on hundreds of empty and second or holiday homes in the city until April 2025 following delays with the government’s Levelling Up &amp;amp; Regeneration Bill, which provides for the introduction of the new charges.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has granted planning permission for controversial developments of 350 dwellings at St Bridget horticulture nursery on Old Rydon Lane and 182 dwellings at Aldens Farm West, part of the predominantly greenfield 90 hectare South West Exeter extension of 2,500 new homes that stretches from Alphington to the M5. Both developments were widely opposed because of prospective traffic impacts.A new application to redevelop PATERNOSTER HOUSE at the corner of Fore Street and North Street has been submitted a fortnight before previously-granted permission to convert the former department store into flats expired on 22 March. The building is currently owned by property developer Grenadier, part of the Oxygen House group of companies which is also responsible for Exeter City Futures."

Its greenhouse gas emissions inventory excludes aviation emissions from the city’s carbon footprint.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has lost an appeal against its decision that an additional bedroom in a student house in Devonshire Place was unlawful.  Seven students have occupied the house, which costs more than £6,000 per month to rent, since 2020.The government has granted outline approval for a DEVON DEVOLUTION DEAL which could give new housing and transport powers to local councils across the county without changing its existing patchwork of first and second tier and unitary authorities or requiring an elected mayor. Devon’s local authorities will now prepare a business case for its proposals, which would require the consent of all the county’s councils as well as parliamentary approval before taking effect.The refurbishment of PATERNOSTER HOUSE at the corner of Fore Street and North Street has begun, just one month before planning permission to convert the former department store into flats expires.

ON THE AGENDAThe consulation on the draft DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan for Exeter, which is already nearly six years late, closes at the end of March.Details of a new INFRASTRUCTURE LEVY to replace the section 106 agreements and community infrastructure levy charges that are currently imposed on most new development have been published by the government and are out for consultation. It would give local councils new powers to integrate affordable housing and infrastructure such as roads, schools and GP surgeries in development plans and facilitate the local capture of land value increases. The changes, which are being introduced in the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill but will take ten years to implement, would also require councils to engage with communities to create new infrastructure delivery strategies.A public exhibition of revised redevelopment plans for the WATER LANE area is being held at Haven Banks Outdoor Education Centre from 10am-7pm on Friday 24 March and from 10am-4pm on Saturday 25 March.

"content" : "New figures from the 2021 census show that economic activity levels in Exeter declined significantly during the past decade, falling by 4.3% since 2011.Of 331 local authority areas included in Office for National Statistics data, which measures employment levels among over-16 residents including students, only eleven recorded greater falls.Barking and Dagenham recording the highest increase at 3.6%. Several other London boroughs were in the top ten as were Knowsley in Merseyside, Blaenau Gwent in South Wales and Salford in Manchester.Exeter employment levels as a proportion of the city’s population are also now among the lowest in the country at 53.6%.The England and Wales average is 57.2%, but in many areas the economic activity levels are much higher: nearly 70% of the population of Wandsworth works.The principal reason for economic inactivity is being retired (55%), following by being a student (28.4%), looking after a home or family (23.6%) or being long-term sick or disabled (19.1%).Exeter’s population has grown by 11.1% since 2011, at half the rate of Tower Hamlets but nearly 5% faster than the England and Wales average of 6.3%.Employment opportunities in the city have not kept up: the population increased at nearly six times the rate of job creation between 2011 and 2021.The 2023 Centre for Cities Outlook report offers several reasons for Exeter’s poor job creation performance. Of the 62 cities it assesses only four have lower private to public sector employment ratios.The report nevertheless identifies a high proportion of “new economy” activity in Exeter, citing the presence of around 230 such firms in the city. However the data this finding is based on neither uses official classifications of economic activity nor is publicly accessible.National statistics instead show Exeter dominated by over 11,000 health and social work jobs, nearly 9,000 in wholesale and retail trades and another 8,000 in education.More people (4,600) are employed in construction in Exeter than in professional, scientific and technical activities, and only 2,000 work in information and communication.This suggests that the Exeter “new economy” firms that the Centre for Cities report cites actually employ very few people.The Office of National Statistics has also begun publishing new data grouping similar local authority areas together in statistical “clusters” to enable more effective assessment of the impact of policy interventions across key social and economic areas.Exeter’s economic performance places it in the “below median on all economic metrics” cluster, with lower than median scores for employment rate, productivity, pay and disposable household income.Other local authority areas in this cluster are mostly in the East Midlands and North West of England.The city is also slightly below median on connectivity and skills and far below median on well-being metrics. However it performs well on health, with better than median scores across the board."

"content" : "Devon bus users might be surprised to learn that Devon County Council published a plan to improve local services back in 2021. The government required it to do so, as a local transport authority, in response to its new national bus strategy so it could decide which plans to fund and by how much.The county council plan relied on the government granting it more than £100 million but it received just £14.1 million to cover a three-year period.It revised its service improvement plan accordingly and published version two in November. It says annual updates will follow.As part of the plan, Devon County Council set up the “Devon Bus Enhanced Partnership”, a statutory arrangement that is supposed to provide a basis for Devon’s bus service operators to work with the county council to improve services by specifying both improvement aims and the actions required to achieve them.The partnership agreement provides for a board to oversee its implementation. It was originally envisaged that the board would operate as a county council committee and therefore comply with statutory rules on press and public access to meetings and documents.However at its inaugural meeting on 22 November the board instead decided that its meetings would not be open to the public and would sit outside the statutory framework, with agendas and minutes published after the event.The minutes of the following meeting, held on 19 January, were not published until 1 March.Devon Bus Enhanced Partnership board structureThe partnership agreement also established a bus users and stakeholders group referred to as the Bus Forum. It describes this as comprising “a wider range of bus user representatives and stakeholders with a vested interest in the local bus network” including the rail industry, local businesses, passenger representative groups and local councils.It adds that the forum would “provide a second tier of peer review and performance consultation” and would “be able to challenge the success of deliverables” achieved through the service improvement plan, providing feedback and evaluation to the oversight board.Meetings of the forum are also not open to the press or public. We asked Devon County Council to explain why the press and public are not allowed to attend either board or forum meetings.It said: “There is no legal requirement for enhanced partnership board meetings to be held in public. Due to the strategic and often commercially sensitive discussion at meetings, the board decided they would not be held in public, however meeting notes would be published.”While it is true that there is no statutory requirement that these board meetings must be held in public, the partnership agreement says that they will.It quotes the statutory basis for local authority meetings, saying: “Meetings of the EPB [Enhanced Partnership Board] will be held as if they are meetings of a decision-making body for the purposes of the Local Authorities (Executive Arrangements) (Meetings and Access to Information) (England) Regulations 2012” and goes on to rehearse the public access provisions of those regulations.Nor is there any justification for holding these meetings in private. Peninsula Transport, the South West’s sub-national transport body, which is also hosted by Devon County Council, is not a statutory body but nevertheless operates in line with statutory requirements on openness.When we pressed the county council on this, it said the partnership board “is not a public forum or a council meeting - it is a meeting of key stakeholders who are working collectively to improve services”.This is not a reason for preventing the press and public attending its meetings, while it hardly seems likely that commercial bus operators would disclose highly sensitive information in meetings which their competitors also attend.The Peninsula Transport board encompasses a much broader cross-section of interests than the Devon Bus Enhanced Partnership board, yet sees no reasons to hold its meetings in private.When “commercially sensitive discussion” is on the agenda it simply makes use of the statutory provisions under which press and public may be excluded from its meetings.Devon Bus Enhanced Partnership areaAt least the partnership board minutes are published, which is more than can be said for the forum.Devon County Council said: “The Bus Forum is an informal group who meet [sic] three times a year to discuss local issues relating to bus services across Devon.“There is no legal requirement for Devon County Council to form a Bus Forum; we have not published the terms of reference or membership list, and due to the informal nature of the forum no minutes were taken or will be published.”It is true that there is no statutory requirement to set up the forum. It is also true that the forum is a key constituent of the partnership, which is itself a statutory arrangement under the Bus Services Act 2017 and so is hardly “informal”, as the county council claims.When we asked how anyone would know what happened at its meetings, Devon County Council said: “At no point have we said that ‘no notes’ are taken. Notes and associated actions are taken by attendees. This is not the same as minutes”.It will be interesting to see how the forum’s chair, who sits on the board, will report to the board without an agreed summary – or minutes – of what happened at each forum meeting. Or perhaps we won’t see, as the press and public are excluded from both.  Bus forum membership  Devon County Council told us that forum membership is by invitation only and is limited to:      Bus operator representatives, including community transport operators    One representative from each of Devon’s eight Highways and Traffic Orders Committees “to ensure adequate representation of both county and district councillors”    Two representatives from Devon parish and town councils appointed by the Devon Association of Local Councils    Representatives from bus user groups and other relevant organisations with a recognised constitution, to be approved by the county council’s Transport Coordination Service    Stakeholders from education, health and other modes of transport such as rail operators    DVSA, TravelWatch and other recognised industry bodies    Transport Coordination Service officers and the county council Cabinet Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport  We asked Devon County Council whether it was saying there was a link between the absence of a statutory requirement to form the forum and the decision not to publish any terms of reference or membership details.It said: “No - it is not reasonable to assume that because we have not published the terms of reference or membership list in this case that this approach applies to all other stakeholder bodies that involves [sic] Devon County Council.”This suggests that, while the county council may not have a policy on conducting stakeholder-related activities behind closed doors, it chooses to hold such meetings this way as it sees fit, and adopts the same ad hoc approach to publishing the terms of reference and membership information for such bodies too.Devon County Council did, however, provide a list of organisations invited to nominate forum members, although it did not explain the criteria for selecting the organisations, only saying that they were “stakeholders”, and none of its responses explain why either the board or the forum have been placed in the closed door category.It nevertheless says on its website that it is “committed to the principles of openness and transparency, and aims to make as much information as possible available to the public”."

"content" : "EXETER CITY COUNCIL has postponed a major review of its governance – which was already six months late – for the sixth time, and now won’t address the issues it raises until the end of July.EXETER PRIDE has cancelled this year’s LGBTQ+ celebration, which was scheduled for 13 May, due to a lack of volunteer co-ordinators and stewards to enable the event to go ahead safely.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has sold former the Pyramids swimming pool site to The Guinness Partnership, which also owns the adjacent Eaton Drive/Eaton House complex, for redevelopment.A MET OFFICE survey which asked a representative sample of the public about climate crisis action has found that 65% of respondents think we should be doing more to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.The conversion of BEAUFORT HOUSE, a 3,000m2 five storey office block on New North Road, to a 107-bed student accommodation facility has been approved by the city council.The INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE has published its Sixth Assessment synthesis report, bringing together its three previous working group reports to deliver a “final warning” as the world approaches irrevocable damage caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions which can only be averted with deep emissions cuts.Meanwhile council-run VISIT EXETER is promoting tourist visits to Exeter by plane from Scotland to Exeter Airport. Its greenhouse gas emissions inventory excludes aviation emissions from the city’s carbon footprint.The consulation on the draft DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan for Exeter, which is already nearly six years late, closes at the end of March.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has lost an appeal against its decision that an additional bedroom in a student house in Devonshire Place was unlawful.  Seven students have occupied the house, which costs more than £6,000 per month to rent, since 2020.The government has granted outline approval for a DEVON DEVOLUTION DEAL which could give new housing and transport powers to local councils across the county without changing its existing patchwork of first and second tier and unitary authorities or requiring an elected mayor. Devon’s local authorities will now prepare a business case for its proposals, which would require the consent of all the county’s councils as well as parliamentary approval before taking effect.Details of a new INFRASTRUCTURE LEVY to replace the section 106 agreements and community infrastructure levy charges that are currently imposed on most new development have been published by the government and are out for consultation. It would give local councils new powers to integrate affordable housing and infrastructure such as roads, schools and GP surgeries in development plans and facilitate the local capture of land value increases. The changes, which are being introduced in the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill but will take ten years to implement, would also require councils to engage with communities to create new infrastructure delivery strategies.A public exhibition of revised redevelopment plans for the WATER LANE area is being held at Haven Banks Outdoor Education Centre from 10am-7pm on Friday 24 March and from 10am-4pm on Saturday 25 March. Around 1,000 high density housing units, including student accommodation and built to rent flats, are expected on the brownfield site. The information on display will also be available on the developer’s website.The refurbishment of PATERNOSTER HOUSE at the corner of Fore Street and North Street is apparently about to begin, just one month before planning permission to convert the former department store into flats expires. Property developer Grenadier, part of the Oxygen House group of companies which is also responsible for Exeter City Futures, does not expect the project to be complete until the end of 2024.Bindu Arjoon has been appointed as EXETER CITY COUNCIL CEO following the sudden termination of her predecessor Karime Hassan’s employment just before Christmas. Currently interim CEO, she was previously deputy CEO and was appointed after an internal selection process.Plans to redevelop the derelict COWLEY BRIDGE ROAD Johnsons cleaners site to provide a total of 350 beds of student accommodation in four blocks up to six storeys tall have been submitted for approval by the city council. The laundry facility was badly damaged by fire three years ago and was demolished last year.EAST DEVON DISTRICT COUNCIL has granted outline planning permission for a development of 1,035 low density residential dwellings alongside the old A30. “Treasbeare garden village” will extend Cranbrook southwards across 91 hectares of largely agricultural land towards Exeter Airport, and is expected to take ten years to complete.A public consultation on a DEVON, CORNWALL &amp;amp; ISLES OF SCILLY CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLAN which will attempt to minimise the impact of climate change on the South West peninsula will be held from 8 May before a final version is adopted during the autumn, four and a half years after Devon County Council convened the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group to “act now to tackle [the] climate emergency”.Liberal Democrat councillor Kevin Mitchell has been nominated to become Exeter’s next LORD MAYOR with the Green Party’s Tess Read as his deputy. Their appointment is expected at the council’s annual meeting on 16 May.Exeter City Council has decided to sell Grade II listed WEIRFIELD HOUSE in Larkbeare Road above the Port Royal public house on the open market. It has been used for temporary accommodation since the 1980s and requires extensive renovation."

The prison has the highest rates of self-harm in the country, with 26 suicides in recent years, high levels of violence, very poor conditions and multiple leadership failures. The previous urgent notification concerning conditions in the prison was sent to the justice secretary in 2018.Works at controversial Gladstone Road co-living block THE GORGE have resumed, with the project not now due for completion until the end of the year.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has confirmed that its food waste collections now cover 10.9% of the city’s residential addresses.

"content" : "When council leader Phil Bialyk introduced his new Exeter grants programme in June 2019, a month after taking office, he said it would be “an exciting and bold step forward for the council in our endeavours to support community groups and organisations as they continue to work together on local projects that help make Exeter such a great place to live”.The programme was intended to have a long-term impact on inequality, health and individual and community resilience across the city. Ward grants of up to £500 would be available for one-off hyperlocal projects, small grants of up to £3,000 for city-wide projects or events and large grants of up to £30,000 for community building, refurbishment or equipment costs.Community centres could also apply for up to £5,000 each year towards their running costs, and a “strategic fund”, to be financed using any unspent grant money, could be used for one-off capital costs for “bespoke or larger projects” providing community facilities.The council said the scheme supported more than 200 projects during its first eighteen months. It emphasised its “on-going commitment to working with its communities” and “maintaining a robust grant giving programme for Exeter”.However it cut the community grants budget by nearly a quarter in its second full year of operation, then lopped off another £118,000 last year before reducing it to a rump of just £15,000 in the 2023-24 budget that the council agreed last week. There is nothing in next year’s budget for ward grants, small grants or community centre running costs at all.At the council’s budget meeting council leader Phil Bialyk said: “I am proud of the fact that we have been able to maintain support to our communities in Exeter.” He also said that community groups and organisations would be “further boosted with the launch of the Exeter community lottery later this year” despite the prospect of this raising very little money and requiring council resources to set up and run.He says the cost of living is to blame for council budget cuts of more than £3 million, which would have been more than £5.5 million if the council hadn’t used nearly £2.5 million of its reserves – which will now have to be replenished – to cushion the blow.He did not mention the impact on council finances of £80 million it borrowed to build St Sidwell’s Point and buy back the Guildhall shopping centre leasehold, or that it still intends to loan Exeter City Living £11 million this year for its stalled Clifton Hill redevelopment and now has to find an additional £18 million to enable the company to deliver at Vaughan Road.Nor did he mention that council leisure services are now expected to be loss-making despite previous insistence that they would be cost-neutral, requiring a £2 million annual subsidy, that Guildhall shopping centre income will now be spent on debt interest instead of regeneration, or that Exeter City Living had lost more money by this time last year than all the council 2023-24 budget cuts put together.When opposition leader Diana Moore asked why the council hadn’t carried out an auditor’s recommendation to hold a public consultation on the budget, as it agreed last November, the council leader’s response was to insist that “this council is the voice of Exeter”.This was also apparently the basis of its last-minute decision to spend £100,000 on paddling pool refurbishment next year. He said the council “needed to act to secure the future of the hugely popular splash park in St Thomas and paddling pools in Heavitree because we know how important these free facilities are to residents”.He didn’t mention that the council announced its plans to overhaul both in 2021 after partially refurbishing them earlier that year, or that new pumps have already been installed at Heavitree, or that St Thomas was suddenly closed during last summer’s heatwave because children were slipping on the new surface, falling and injuring themselves, then reopened with warning signs and new rules requiring parents to provide them with water shoes to use the pool.He also didn’t mention that St Thomas is a marginal ward in which the council’s deputy leader nearly lost her seat at last year’s local elections to Liberal Democrat Adrian Fullam, or that his party would like to win back one of the two Heavitree seats it lost to the Green Party last year after Carol Bennett won a single year term in a by-election.The council was so keen to promote its splash pool spending that it published a story describing it as a “major investment” a fortnight before the expenditure was actually approved. And it broke its own spending rules by doing so immediately after the council leader made clear that there was no scope for extracurricular spending either this year or for the next three, during which another £3.15 million of council budget cuts must be made.He said: “To maintain financial discipline and prepare for the reductions required, council can no longer merely approve additional expenditure without identifying what will be cut to fund it. This is essential as officers and members prepare to identify ways to address the further gaps in funding over the life of the medium term financial plan.”The paddling pool proposals did not specify from where the money they will cost would be cut, presumably leaving council officers to come up with back of the sofa suggestions.His communities portfolio holder, Martin Pearce, evidently didn’t get the austerity message. After admitting that the community grants scheme was “massively diminished”, he sought to defend its decimation on the grounds that it is funded by Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) receipts which he said cannot be allocated until they are received, claiming that the grants budget “will be adjusted and money will go into it as the year progresses”.Apart from the fact that the community grants scheme is not financed this way because CIL charges – that the council imposes on most new development – are not usually all collected in the same year they are issued, the council instead using a rolling fund to enable prospective budget-setting, the portfolio holder then went on to admit that he was, in any case, referring to 2024-25.He also said he was “really excited” about the £15,000 that had been allocated to the remains of the scheme. It seems unlikely that the hundreds of grassroots groups and community organisations that previously depended on it to cover essential costs will feel the same way.Rather than money going into community grants budgets as CIL charges are collected, the opposite has happened in every full year of the scheme so far. The council has first reallocated community grants budgets to other priorities then cut the following year’s budgets while repeatedly claiming that the funding “will be available to re-allocate in future years”.Meanwhile CIL charges have been increasing since the community grants scheme was introduced, rising from just under £3.5 million in 2019-20 to just under £4 million in 2021-22. The amount of available CIL receipts retained at the end of each year has also risen: a council report published at the end of last year put the total at nearly £6.5 million.When the community grants scheme was launched it was specifically intended to “provide a sustainable funding pipeline for grants” via the “neighbourhood” share of CIL receipts, which is at least 15% of total CIL charges (25% in areas where there is a neighbourhood plan such as St James).New Homes Bonus, a central government grant paid to local councils to incentivise house-building, was also used to help finance a small portion of the scheme at first, but this was phased out by the end of the scheme’s first year. By March 2021 there was a balance in the neighbourhood CIL fund in excess of £1 million and the expectation was that “further funds will materialise”.It’s not clear why the council expects 2023-24 to buck this trend given the city’s continuing housing delivery rates, but even if CIL charges fall by as much as it says it expects, they are still likely to exceed £2.5 million. In which case the minimum 15% allocation to neighbourhood spending would still yield at least £375,000 for community grants, more if development takes place in St James.

Subscribe freeIt may be that instead of using neighbourhood CIL receipts to finance hundreds of projects across the city, the council would rather choose a handful of what might be called “preferred” recipients for larger grants instead.Total expenditure via the community grants strategic fund was originally intended to be £80,000. But the council ended up sharing £410,000 between eight projects via this route after reallocating other community grant budgets in their favour over several years.Recipients included Exwick Community Centre, in the council leader’s ward, and Positive Light Projects, where his party recently presented its parliamentary candidate to the city.The council leader says it is “spending our money wisely”, citing the £100,000 St Thomas and Heavitree splash parks decision as an example “at a time of crisis”. But it is cutting the Citizens Advice Exeter budget by the same amount, and the Exeter Connect voluntary and community sector support service provided by Exeter Community Initiatives will lose all its council funding at the end of this month.The 2023-24 budget comes into force on 1 April, yet there is no sign of the impending changes on the Exeter grants programme webpages. Instead the council says: “We will published [sic] next financial year’s grants programme by May 2023”. Presumably just as soon as the polls have closed."

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s Executive committee had twenty items on its agenda when it last met a fortnight ago but, according to the council, it only actually took one decision.Decisions on another thirteen items of Executive business are instead to be taken this evening by a meeting of all the councillors elected to represent the city’s residents, the “full council”.However, according to the legislation that underpins the way the council performs its functions, several of these decisions should have been taken by the Executive instead.At other meetings the Executive should be taking most decisions but takes none at all.And the council is inconsistent about decision-making. Last month the Executive decided to increase council housing rents by the maximum allowed by law, but last year’s decision to do the same thing was taken by the full council instead.It’s hardly surprising that councillors are confused about the rules. When presenting his proposals for a council lottery at the end of last year, Labour councillor Martin Pearce claimed that the Executive, of which he is a member, doesn’t take decisions.He said debate about his proposals should take place at full council, which would decide whether to adopt them, despite the legislation saying this decision should have been taken by the Executive.He also proposed the council’s latest homelessness strategy to the Executive a fortnight ago, although tonight’s full council meeting will approve it, again despite the legislation.And while he changed the council’s constitution to allow opposition leaders to ask questions at Executive committee meetings, council leader Phil Bialyk no longer answers them there, instead providing written replies long after debate has concluded.Green party councillor Diana Moore asked several questions at last month’s Executive meeting seeking more clarity on tonight’s budget proposals, but the responses took five weeks to appear and failed to answer most of her questions when they did.How have things come to this?The council governance reforms introduced by the 2000 Local Government Act explicitly intended to separate policy-making, decision-making and scrutiny with the aim of delivering “greater efficiency, transparency and accountability”.The new Executive arrangements Exeter City Council adopted following the Act meant that, from then on, occasional full council meetings would approve overarching policy frameworks and budgets proposed by an executive committee, which would also implement them.This Executive, of nine councillors including a leader, would be chosen each year by council members and be collectively responsible for discharging its duties.Accompanying regulations detailed what local authority executives could do, what they could not do, and what they could only do in conjunction with the full council.In 2007 the Labour government decided that these arrangements hampered decision-making because council leaders were not able to act alone in choosing executive members and might find it difficult to push through unpopular decisions.After the Conservative-led coalition took over in 2010 it followed through, requiring all local authorities to change their Executive arrangements by no later than May the following year.Exeter Guildhall - centre of the city’s civic government for 600 yearsExeter City Council duly decided in December 2010 to adopt a new setup known as “strong leader” arrangements in which councillors elect a leader for a four-year term who then appoints Executive members on an annual basis.The revised Executive arrangements were agreed the following April, took effect in May 2011 and have remained in force ever since.A 2019 council guide called “how decisions are made” says “the Executive is responsible for the most significant and day to day decisions which are not delegated to officers”.And the section of the council’s constitution which sets out the full council’s functions confirms that it should only take decisions which are properly the responsibility of the Executive if the Executive overreaches its powers by deciding something that would be “contrary to the policy framework or contrary to or not wholly in accordance with the budget” it has agreed.In other words, while the full council is there to safeguard against the Executive (or council leader) running amok, the Executive should be the council’s principal decision-maker (with many of its functions delegated to council officers or sub-committees) unless things go wrong.So once the budget and policy framework is in place, meetings of the full council are there largely to ensure that the Executive (or council leader) stays within their bounds.The key word, as in the legislation, is “contrary”. Full council meetings are not there to make minor budget alterations or variations to existing policies, and are certainly not there to take decisions which do not affect the budget or policy framework at all.Exeter City Council in session at Exeter Guildhall. Photo: © Sandra Barrett, All Rights Reserved.However instead of Exeter City Council’s Executive performing its functions as intended, most of the decisions it should take are instead taken at full council meetings.The Executive even submits reports that do not require any decision at all for full council approval. One such report is going to this evening’s meeting despite the programme it relates to already having been approved this time last year.The contrast between the way Devon County Council and Exeter City Council decide things, despite both having adopted Executive arrangements under the same legislation, is striking.The county council’s February forward plan identifies sixteen decisions it expects to take over the next three months of which only two will require full council approval. The other fourteen will be taken by the county council’s cabinet, the equivalent of the city council’s executive.These include the adoption of a wide range of plans and strategies as well as the approval of various capital budgets and infrastructure scheme proposals. County council financial reporting and monitoring is all also dealt with by its cabinet.The city council does things the other way round. Its February forward plan lists 29 decisions to be taken over the next three months of which 22 are to be taken at full council meetings.Among these is the curiously-titled “Report of the Plant Based Task and Finish Group”. Should we expect its conclusions to be contrary to the council’s existing budget or policy framework?Exeter City Council 2022-23 executive portfolio holders and non-executive member champions (top left to right): Naima Allock, Martin Pearce, Josie Parkhouse, Barbara Denning, Duncan Wood, Zion Lights, Amal Ghusain, Emma Morse, Phil Bialyk, Laura Wright, Ruth Williams.The council Executive does occasionally take key decisions, those which are likely to result in significant expenditure (or savings) against council-set budgets or significant impact in more than one electoral ward. It sets its budgetary significance threshold at £1 million, although many other councils set theirs at £100,000.But it appears to think that other decisions that are in line with the council’s policy framework and budget (leaving aside matters such as planning, licensing and audit that are dealt with by specific committees) cannot be Executive decisions so must be taken at full council meetings.Three years ago a Court of Appeal ruling concerning a council cabinet’s decision to adopt a ten-year sports strategy gave what was described as “valuable guidance to local authorities on the division of functions between full council and cabinet”.The judgement confirmed that all functions of local authorities (that have adopted Executive arrangements) should be exercised by their executives unless overreaching their powers, and that the scope for what constitutes overreach should be “fairly narrow”.It said it should not simply apply to “any strategy” that “is likely to have implications for future expenditure in the event that it is implemented”, adding: “A decision which is merely likely (or even very likely) to lead to a future decision involving such expenditure [of money not provided for in the budget or capital expenditure plan] will remain the responsibility of the executive.”Council leader Phil Bialyk and CEO Karime Hassan contemplate cuts to Executive decision-making scrutiny in October 2019Notwithstanding the legislation, Exeter City Council’s approach to decision-making might at first appear more democratic, tasking full council meetings with taking all but a small subset of decisions.But apart from the risks of taking potentially unlawful decisions, its approach also has the effect of frustrating the principles at the heart of the 2000 Local Government Act reforms, more recently reasserted in the 2011 Localism Act.One was that policy-making, performed at full council meetings, should be separated from (most) decision-making, performed by the Executive.Another was that a second safeguard against Executive (or council leader) overreach should be provided by scrutiny committees on which Executive members are not allowed to sit.To enable backbench councillors that sit on these committees to hold Executives to account they are afforded legal powers to “call in” executive decisions, delaying their implementation so they can be subjected to greater scrutiny, reconsidered and potentially overturned.They also have enhanced powers to access confidential information, can investigate any issue which affects “the area or the area’s inhabitants” and can call councillors, council officers and representatives of external bodies to attend and give evidence, like parliamentary select committees.As statutory government guidance says, “the role that overview and scrutiny can play in holding an authority’s decision-makers to account makes it fundamentally important to the successful functioning of local democracy”.But not at Exeter City Council, because scrutiny powers only have teeth when Executive functions are being discharged. When most decisions are made at full council meetings scrutiny can no longer provide the “check and balance on the executive” that is intended.And there is another anti-democratic consequence of choosing to take what should be Executive decisions at full council meetings.Doing so emboldens the council to claim that rules about public access to executive meetings and documents that became law in 2012, replacing outmoded regulations which had accompanied the 2000 Local Government Act, simply don’t apply.These require local authorities (that have adopted Executive arrangements) to publish at least 28 clear days’ notice of their intention to hold any part of an executive meeting in private, and provide for the public to make representations about why the meeting should instead be open.The government said it introduced the new rules because the previous regulations “resulted in more meetings being held in private than could be properly justified”.It added that the new regulations “materially strengthen transparency and openness, by providing a clear presumption that all meetings of the executives, their committees or sub committees, must be held in public except in limited prescribed circumstances”.Three items were heard in private at this month’s Executive meeting, one of which concerned cuts to senior council management. Only 21 days’ notice was given of the intention to hear it in private, so we made a representation that the notice required by law had not been provided.The council’s response was that the legislation does not apply because the item in question was not an Executive decision.Bizarrely, it then said it had fulfilled its obligations under the legislation it said does not apply by including our representation and its response on the meeting agenda.Another item concerning cuts at RAMM was also supposed to be heard in private at the meeting, about which it said the same thing, but by the time the meeting came there was no sign of it on the agenda at all.If the council’s claim that these rules only apply when Executive decisions are being made was true, it would be free to conduct most Executive business as it pleases.However the 2012 regulations apply not only because its Executive should be taking decisions on most of the business that comes before it, but because these rules apply to Executive meetings in any case, as the legislation makes clear.  Access to council executive meetings and documents  From Open and accountable local government - Plain English Guide, Department of Communities and Local Government, August 2014:  A council’s executive (i.e. the council’s cabinet) is its main decision making body consisting of an elected mayor or leader and a number of councillors.  What are the national rules for access to meetings and documents of a council’s executive?  The national rules are principally provided by the Local Authorities (Executive Arrangements) (Meetings and Access to Information) (England) Regulations 2012 which introduced significantly greater transparency and openness into the meetings of a council’s executive, its committees and sub-committees.  How will I know about a private meeting of my council’s executive?  Prior to holding a private meeting, your council must have published on its website and at its offices at least 28 clear days’ notice of its intention to consider a matter in private and the reasons for the private meeting.  Can a private meeting of my council’s executive be held if 28 days’ notice is not given to the public?  A private meeting can only be held without 28 days’ notice after the agreement of the Chairman of the overview and scrutiny committee has been obtained that the meeting is urgent and cannot reasonably be delayed.  If agreement is not given then the meeting must either be held in public, or the council must comply with the 28 day notice requirements.So we have legislation which enables council leaders to dominate their Executives, because their four-year terms and annual appointment powers combine to disincentivise dissent, and Executives which are supposed to take (or delegate) most council decisions.Both are to be held to account by the full council, but only if the Executive overreaches its powers, and by scrutiny committees the rest of the time.However at Exeter City Council we have an Executive which takes very few decisions, bypassing the checks and balances scrutiny is supposed to provide, and full council meetings in which councillors from the council leader’s party votes in favour of anything he tells them to.He even takes it upon himself to stand up in meetings to remind them which way to vote.It is clearly in his interest to send so many Executive decisions for full council approval, although it is an open question whether this would continue were his party’s majority to crumble.But doing so is not in the interests of Exeter’s residents and businesses, who have to live with the consequences of council decision-making.

We were told in December 2021 that Baan Al-Khafaji, the council’s monitoring officer who is responsible for ensuring it complies with the law, and who oversaw the introduction of the current Executive arrangements in 2010, would respond. We never heard from her."

You’ve got children and young people out of school for years in some cases, with no placement at all, no SEND provision.”She blamed “mismanagement” rather than a lack of funding and said comparable counties were doing far better, adding: “There’s no way Devon County Council can begin to address the problems with its services unless it speaks to the very people using those services, which it doesn’t do”.She said the local authority’s 0-25 Team, which carries out the Education, Health and Care Plan assessments on which children’s SEND provision is based needs a “complete overhaul”, with caseworkers currently assigned more than 500 children each and staff not being trained properly.She also described Devon Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services as “broken”.Special educational needs and disabilities protest at County HallIt is now more than four years since Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission first found fault in Devon County Council SEND children’s services following an inspection in December 2018.Among other failings, they said Devon County Council had been too slow to implement the SEND reforms introduced by the government in 2014, four years earlier.The county council’s children’s social care services were then judged inadequate in January 2020 and the Department of Education issued a statutory direction ordering the council to make improvements.Further Ofsted monitoring and a review by the Children’s Commissioner for England followed.Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission then issued another joint report in June last year which again highlighted significant concerns about Devon SEND children’s services.The county council acknowledged its failings but in October the Department of Education found that while there had been some improvement the council was “still failing to perform to an adequate standard”.Then in December the county council was told that its children’s services were considered the “third or fourth worst in the country” and would be taken into special measures and taken over by an independent trust if improvements were not made.The latest Ofsted monitoring report, issued last week, found that key areas still require significant change and serious issues remain.Special educational needs and disabilities protesters at County HallDevon County Council appointed Julian Wooster as interim head of its children’s services in December after Melissa Caslake, his predecessor, left only eighteen months into the job.He had previously performed the same role at Somerset County Council, where the Ofsted children’s services rating improved from “inadequate” to “good”.He said: “We accept that there have been significant problems across the whole system in Devon and that the experience of many parents has not been good. Too often, our support plans have not been timely or good enough.“However we are totally committed and focussed on working together with our schools and with health colleagues to make things better.”He added that a shortage of professional caseworkers meant staff were over-worked and sometimes demoralised, leading to poor case management and communication with parents.Conservative county councillor Andrew Leadbetter, who has been responsible for children’s services since May 2021, said that the council intends to make the improvements that children with SEND and their families need.He said: “Extra resources have been identified in the budget to strengthen our SEND casework team and to help us compete with other local authorities to recruit and retain experienced staff. But we know that this won’t be easy and there are no quick fixes.“We all want to make things better in Devon and we will do everything we possibly can with our partners to meet this challenge.”However Labour county councillor Rob Hannaford, who chairs the council children’s scrutiny committee which is working with Ofsted and the Department of Education to address the failings, said the service “remains a huge concern for me and many others”.He added: “This well-supported protest group and demonstration is an accurate reflection of the pain and frustration that many SEND families feel and experience on a daily basis.”Willow’s parents Emma and ChrisMany of the parents taking part in the protest are desperate for Devon County Council SEND children’s services to change for the better. We asked some to speak about their experiences. The names of their children have been changed to protect their identities.Willow is nine years old. She is deaf and autistic and has been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She has been out of school for almost three years. Her parents Emma and Chris tried to enrol her in a special education school but the county council suggested she attend her local primary school instead, which is unable to meet her needs.As a result Willow has had a home tutor since November 2021. This was supposed to be a temporary measure while a suitable school placement was found, but her parents believe that the county council sees it as a permanent solution to her educational needs.It has taken no further action to place her in full time education, has not replied to emails and phone calls and has removed Willow from the list of students requiring a school placement.Willow’s parents believe that her Education, Health and Care Plan, which was the result of an assessment completed in Kent several years ago and no longer reflects her needs, has not helped secure the educational support she needs.They said: “Devon County Council has just taken this document and filed it away. No one has engaged with us about updating it. We don’t get any communication from the county council unless we threaten legal action.”Willow’s parents say being left out of the education system has made her feel as if she is not wanted.They added: “She doesn’t have a peer group, she rarely leaves the house or gets dressed, she is depressed and she is only nine years old. The impact has been devastating: she is lonely and we are lonely because we, as a family, are isolated.”Theodore’s mother Emma and friendTheodore is eight years old. He is autistic and has Pathological Demand Avoidance and selective mutism. He has never managed a whole week at school and has only attended for eight days since September because his school cannot meet his needs, which it says require reassessment. The county council’s 0-25 Team refuses to perform one.His family is taking the issue to a tribunal, which can take up to a year. They have paid for a private speech and language assessment and are covering the costs of private tutoring support while he is unable to attend school.Theodore’s mother Emma said: “He has an Education, Health and Care Plan but it is not fit for purpose and never has been: there are references to nursery and his autism diagnosis is not included. It was created three years ago and there have been annual reviews since then but Devon County Council has not updated it.“The educational psychologist said he needed small class sizes and one-to-one support so he was funded to be in a private school, but this year that was taken away and as a result he can’t manage.“Devon County Council is now saying that his Education, Health and Care Plan does not specify that he needs one-to-one support, just that he needs a high level of adult support and his current school has interpreted that as fifteen minutes a day before school.“He is currently getting no more support than we, the family, can provide, which has been especially difficult as I have just had a baby. My husband has had to leave his job in order to support us all at home. Things are just falling apart because of the lack of external support.“Theodore is academically bright but it feels as though he has been totally written off by the local authority.“I’ve been fighting Devon County Council for six years because we had exactly the same situation with my daughter. I’ve just complained to the local council ombudsman. I honestly could have written the same letter I did six years ago for my daughter but changed the name. No lessons have been learned, nothing has changed.”Archie’s father DanArchie is nine years old and was diagnosed with autism last August after his family paid for a private assessment. He is in school, but cannot cope there as the school is unable to meet his needs. His family is currently applying for an Education, Health and Care Plan.The county council was willing to pay for Archie’s assessment but the process of getting a diagnosis had already been going on for two years when they were told last year the assessment would not take place for another eighteen months.His father Dan said: “During that period of waiting he reached a point of social and sensory anxiety exhaustion”.He added: “Archie is in mainstream school but he sits on his own in the pottery room. He does have a one-to-one mentor, but there is not much effort being made to try to integrate him. He is socially excluded.”Devon County Council says Archie should be assessed by an educational psychologist as it is not persuaded by the evidence provided by his private assessment. This could take another year.Rory’s mother JuliaRory is twelve years old and has multiple diagnoses including autism. His current school has been unable to meet his needs and, while the county council agrees that he needs to move to another school, there is no space until September and no other provision is available.His mother Julia said: “The system has been failing us. Schools are left to process annual reviews but not all schools have the right training and experience to understand the Education, Health and Care Plan system.“The school blames the 0-25 team and the 0-25 team blames the school, then suddenly another year has passed. Ghost children are falling behind in the system and that becomes most apparent when they move to secondary school.“I have been very fortune in communications with Devon County Council, the caseworker usually gets back to me within a couple of days. I feel sorry for my caseworker because it is the system that is causing the issue.“‘I just want to learn’ is the message my child wants to share. He feels he is a prisoner in his school. He is bored, he wants to be challenged.“I have visited about a hundred primary and secondary schools in my time looking for the right provision for my child. Only one school can meet his needs but it only has three places for children like Rory.”"

"content" : "Proposals to increase council tax charges on underused Exeter housing stock have revealed that 433 homes in the city currently stand empty and another 505 are second or holiday homes, together more than the 933 new homes built here in the past two years.Exeter homes which have been empty for between two and five years, of which there are 50, are currently charged double the normal council tax rate for their band, while those that have been empty for between five and ten years, of which there are twelve, are charged triple.The three houses in the city that have been empty for ten years or more are charged four times the normal rate.However no council tax is payable for the first two months for homes that stand empty, and a 50% discount applies for up to twelve months to homes that are empty during structural repairs.Exeter City Council is proposing to target the 368 empty homes that are currently eligible for these discounts, as well as another 505 second or holiday homes in the city, with new powers being introduced in the government’s Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill.These will allow councils to begin charging double the normal council tax rate for “unoccupied and substantially unfurnished” empty homes after one year, instead of two, and to introduce the same premium for second or holiday homes which are “substantially furnished” but no-one’s sole or main residence.The council hopes the new charges will generate up to £1.5 million in additional annual council tax revenue, of which it would keep around £123,000, while encouraging the return of empty homes to use and the use of second homes as main residences.However implementing the new charges will require additional council resources and their impact on wealthy owners of multiple properties is unclear.Twenty of the Exeter second homes that are likely to be affected are worth more than £820,000 and one more than £1.6 million, while the council tax charges for most second or holiday homes in the city range between £115 and £153 per month.Twelve months’ notice of the new charges is required, so if they are adopted by the council this month and the levelling-up bill receives royal assent by the end of March they will come into force in April next year.Teignbridge District Council passed a similar policy last month from which it hopes to raise around £225,000 and East Devon and Mid Devon district councils are expected to follow suit in three weeks’ time, each hoping to raise around £400,000 additional revenue.Cornwall Council, a unitary authority which keeps 81% of the council tax it charges, expects to raise an additional £25 million each year from the county’s 13,292 registered second homes.Pedestrians pass a rough sleeper at Exeter GuildhallThe new legislation is partly intended to close a loophole which allowed owners of empty homes to furnish them as if they are second or holiday homes to avoid paying increased council tax charges.Homes that are used as short-term holiday lets (including Airbnb rentals) are often not liable for council tax as they must instead be registered for business rates if they are available for more than 140 days each year.However doing so means they are likely to be eligible for small business rates relief and other financial benefits which frequently mean neither council tax nor business rates are paid on properties used this way.

The rapid rise in UK second and holiday home ownership has been accompanied by falling owner-occupancy rates.British households owned 873,000 second homes in 2018-19 – many owning more than one – of which 495,000 were in the UK, a figure that nearly doubled over the preceding decade.These assets represent around £1 trillion in property wealth. The number of UK adults in families with wealth from properties in addition to their own home has risen by more than half this century to around one in ten of the population.However by 2019 64% of the UK’s 23.2 million households were owner-occupiers, a fall from 71% in 2003.2021 census data shows Exeter owner-occupancy rates of just 58.3% with much higher levels of private rented household tenure than across the rest of the country."

The scheme’s eighth design iteration provided 955 rooms at “optimum density”, 89 fewer than before, and slightly reduced building heights and footprints from the previous version. An appeal against the decision is expected after the May local elections.Exeter City Council approved EXETER COLLEGE plans to erect floodlights and a three metre fence around a new artificial pitch at Flowerpot Fields at the same meeting despite widespread objections to its original plans.

The application follows the approval of a licensing variation to allow its use as a venue for boxing, wrestling, theatre, film and music events on 30 January.PINHOE COMMUNITY HUB has resubmitted its application for a new building at Station Road playing fields following the lapse of the previous permission, granted three years ago.The prison inspectorate published a damning report on 16 February into what it called “shocking standards” at EXETER PRISON after issuing a second consecutive urgent notification for the prison – the first time it has done so. The prison has the highest rates of self-harm in the country, with 26 suicides in recent years, high levels of violence, very poor conditions and multiple leadership failures. The previous urgent notification concerning conditions in the prison was sent to the justice secretary in 2018.Works at controversial Gladstone Road co-living block THE GORGE have resumed, with the project not now due for completion until the end of the year.SOUTH WEST WATER is consulting on its draft Water Resources Management Plan, which sets out how it intends to ensure a secure regional water supply and manage its environmental impact, until 19 May.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has confirmed that its food waste collections now cover 10.9% of the city’s residential addresses. Coverage is expected to reach 16.9% from early March with further expansion aiming at 35% coverage by the end of May, seven years after the collections were promised.Another 100 new homes will be built in the TOPSHAM GAP beside Clyst Road after the developer successfully appealed against the council’s planning permission refusal. The same developer also won an appeal against council refusal of 155 homes and a 64-bed care home on an adjacent site in 2019.The budget for the EXETER CITY LIVING Vaughan Road redevelopment has soared from £9.2 million to £27.2 million, with the council now expected to lend an additional £13 million to its development company to complete what will now be a mix of 35 affordable and 56 market rent flats, 25 fewer affordable homes than planned.The UNIVERSITY OF EXETER has twice refused to identify the members of its community engagement panel or residents liaison group under Freedom of Information legislation and is being referred to the Information Commissioner for failing to do so.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has approved plans to replace Buckerell Lodge with a retirement home, deferred a decision on a development of 350 dwellings at St Bridget horticulture nursery on Old Rydon Lane and refused a 26-bed student accommodation block on Howell Road.EXETER LABOUR proposals to spend £100,000 on a splash pool in St Thomas, a marginal ward in which the council’s deputy leader nearly lost her seat at last year’s local elections, has led city council news coverage of a budget which cuts more than £3 million of public spending.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has approved the use of Exeter Chiefs’ Sandy Park stadium as a venue for boxing, wrestling, theatre, film and music events.DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL is consulting on its draft proposals for adult social care provision until 19 March.Royal College of Nursing staff at the ROYAL DEVON NHS TRUST resumed strike action on 6 February alongside South Western Ambulance Service workers as healthcare professionals across the country stage the biggest strike in NHS history.Detailed plans for the Honiton Road MOOR EXCHANGE RETAIL PARK have been submitted for approval. Outline planning permission for the development was granted two years ago.The police inspectorate says DEVON AND CORNWALL POLICE must make urgent improvements after it was found to be inadequate in three of nine areas including responding to emergency and non-emergency calls and managing registered sexual and violent offenders. Its assessment found two other areas required improvement while two more were graded “good”. A new chief constable was appointed in December after the force was placed under enhanced inspectorate monitoring last year.DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL is consulting on its draft Exeter Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan, which is already nearly six years late, until the end of March. Public exhibitions take place from 11am-7pm on 14-15 February and 15-16 March at County Hall.UNIVERSITY OF EXETER staff resumed strike action over pay, pensions and working conditions on 1 February alongside Exeter school teaching staff with dozens more strike days planned during February and March.EAST DEVON DISTRICT COUNCIL has granted planning permission for 44 new dwellings and 6,000m2 of new office space beside Exeter Science Park."

The remaining students are only registered for a single semester.The university’s Exeter roll has fallen 9,335 since last year when it said 39,000 students were based at its campuses in the city.The cancellation of A-level exams in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic led to a surge in students gaining undergraduate places at universities with more competitive entrance requirements as a result of teacher assessment-driven grade inflation.The proportion of A* A-level grades awarded in 2020 nearly doubled to 14.4% from 7.8% the previous year, then increased again in 2021 to 19.1% of all A-level grades awarded.There were also significant increases in A grade awards, leading to oversubscription of university places and a significant number of deferrals encouraged by universities to spread the impact.

"content" : "Exeter City Council intends to change the charges it levies on most new development towards the cost of infrastructure that is needed to mitigate its impact.Community infrastructure levy charges are used to pay for community grants, habitat impact mitigation and larger projects like Marsh Barton railway station. Of the £10.84 million committed to significant infrastructure since the council introduced its levy in 2013 nearly three-quarters has been spent on St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre while another £840,000 was used to reconfigure a road junction at Sandy Park.The council intends to introduce differential charging rates for Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) and co-living, and for flats that are built for rent and sale, despite each pair having essentially identical development forms and there being nothing to prevent students renting co-living rooms, or flats that are built for sale being rented out.It employed external consultants to produce viability evidence and a background report to support its new charging proposals, imposing a differential rates typology in line with council development policy objectives and excluding assessment of other residential or retail levy charges despite these development forms contributing a significant proportion of levy revenue.It also ignored its own statutory infrastructure funding statement and the new local plan’s evidence base and emerging policies, relied on a private consultation with vested interests for its viability assumptions and ignored government guidance on setting levy rates.Its new levy charges will not bring in any more money than the current charges. They will contribute only 27% of an infrastructure funding gap of at least £93 million, leaving Exeter far short of the new infrastructure it needs.The council opened a consultation on its proposals as the Christmas holiday period began immediately after an attempt by opposition councillors to prevent them going ahead in their current form. It is a model of obfuscation and has only been publicised once.The new levy charging schedule, with any revisions that may be made following the consultation, will be submitted for public examination later this year then come into force if approved.This is the first time Exeter City Council has reviewed its community infrastructure levy charges since they were introduced after the adoption of its 2012 Core Strategy.This document finalised the current local plan, which also incorporates policies saved from the 1995-2011 Exeter Local Plan First Review, county mineral and waste plans, supplementary planning documents and a neighbourhood plan.Many of these policies, like the evidence base that underpins them, some of which is nearly twenty years old, are out of date.The new Exeter Local Plan which, according to the council’s development scheme, is expected to reach publication stage next month before being submitted for examination in June, has already passed through two consultation stages after being launched two years ago.An extensive review of the local plan evidence base has taken place, with new up-to-date evidence published last year.Exeter Observer new Exeter Local Plan outline draft consultation briefingDespite this, the council’s new levy charging proposals do not take into account any of the new local plan’s evidence base or emerging policies, and depend instead on the current, largely outdated Exeter planning policy framework.Council officers insist that this is an appropriate way to proceed, while the council’s consultants have limited their assessment to policies contained in the 2012 Core Strategy alone on the basis it is the “most up to date”.However government guidance on Community Infrastructure Levy charging, which explains its legislative context, says that “the relevant plan” in relation to the levy can be “any strategic policy”.It says: “In addition to taking account of market conditions and infrastructure needs, charging authorities should also consider linking a review of their charging schedule to any substantive review of the evidence base for the relevant plan.”Exeter City Council 2021-22 Annual Infrastructure Funding Statement November 2022The council also ignored government guidance by not including its statutory annual infrastructure funding statement in the levy review.The government says: “Local authorities must publish an infrastructure funding statement, and information should be drawn from this […] to identify the infrastructure funding gap and a levy funding target”.It also says: “At examination, the charging authority should set out the projects or types of infrastructure that are to be funded in whole or in part by the levy. From December 2020, this should be set out in an infrastructure funding statement.”Despite its 2021-22 statement being published in November, and appearing on the agenda of the same council meeting that discussed the levy review, it was not mentioned during discussion of the levy at the meeting and has neither been used as evidence in the review nor published alongside it as required.The council’s current infrastructure funding statement sets out the projects to which it expects community infrastructure levy to contribute in the form of a draft infrastructure list.These are the Liveable Exeter developments at Water Lane, the quay and canal basin, Marsh Barton, Red Cow Village, East, West, South and North Gate, Wonford and Exeter Arena.None of these, except Alphington Road vehicle capacity and schools provision related to Water Lane, are included in the infrastructure delivery plan that the council used for its levy review.The council says it intends to update this delivery plan to include the Liveable Exeter development sites on which the new local plan is centred, but not until after its levy charging proposals have been submitted for examination.Exeter City Council Revised Infrastructure Delivery Plan November 2022While community infrastructure levy charges must be implemented in the context of local development policies, the government is nevertheless clear that “differential rates should not be used as a means to deliver policy objectives”.Yet while the council ignored Liveable Exeter development infrastructure funding requirements in its levy review, the policy objectives it is pursuing via these developments drive its differential levy charging rate proposals.It wants high density development, primarily on brownfield land, primarily for rent, to be delivered primarily by its wholly-owned property development company, Exeter City Living, and a new development corporation being planned by Exeter City Futures on the council’s behalf as part of the controversial Exeter Development Fund.Its proposed new levy charges not only incentivise delivery of its development policy objectives, they would confer financial benefits on its development company partners too.The government also provides clear guidance on how local authorities should set community infrastructure levy rates. It says they should use “an area-based approach, involving a broad test of viability across their area, as the evidence base to underpin their charge”.It also says they “must use ‘appropriate available evidence’ (as defined in the section 211(7A) of the Planning Act 2008) to inform the preparation of their draft charging schedule” and that they “need to demonstrate that their proposed levy rate or rates are informed by ‘appropriate available evidence’ and [are] consistent with that evidence across their area as a whole”.However the viability assessment the council commissioned does not supply area-based evidence to support most of its conclusions. The council’s determination to structure its levy charges around its development policy objectives means that “tested forms of development in Exeter” which supply evidence for the three new charge types it wants to introduce are very thin on the ground.Exeter City Council community infrastructure levy charging area with city centre zoneA private consultation organised by the council in February last year confirmed its cart before horse approach at the outset.Council development director Ian Collinson described this as “engagement with the local development industry and the wider planning team to inform assumptions for a viability assessment”. However only eight of “around 50 organisations” who were contacted responded.These included three large firms with interests in thousands of UK properties but without any apparent connection to Exeter or the region despite having footprints in “nearly all major cities” between them, and two local planning consultants, one a micro-entity and another based at a residential address.There were three others: Exeter City Council, Exeter City Living and Exeter City Futures. Despite government guidance that local authorities “must consult and should collaborate with [county councils] in setting the levy” it appears that Devon County Council did not take part.Inconveniently for the council, its respondents confirmed the lack of evidence for its proposed new charge types. One said there is a “lack of applications” to provide evidence for a flats for sale charge, another that flats for rent and co-living are both untested and a third that it is difficult to assess co-living “as there are currently no operable schemes in Exeter”.The council’s consultants agreed with all three comments, and acknowledged their reliance on data from outside Exeter to assess build to rent schemes, confirming that “neither build to rent nor co-living is currently available in Exeter”.A council officer even admitted during a meeting that there is no local viability evidence to determine a differential rate for co-living.The Gorge: permission was granted for co-living in November 2020 but the project was delayed then stalled a month ago when contractors pulled out.None of this deterred the council from pursuing its policy-driven levy charge proposals, even though government guidance makes clear that setting differential levy rates raises the evidence bar even higher.It says local authorities “will need to ensure that the differential rates are supported by robust evidence on viability” and that “fine-grained sampling is also likely to be necessary where they wish to differentiate between categories or scales of intended use” to “provide a robust evidence base about the potential effects of the rates proposed”.Instead of assessing whether sufficiently robust viability evidence from existing local development exists to back up the council’s policy-driven development typology, its consultants relied on a strikingly circular rationale.They cited “changes and new products in the local property market” since 2013, which they also said were only “likely to come forward in the future in Exeter”, following “a review of planning applications and discussion with council officers” around “potential future development”.To justify PBSA’s inclusion in the review (presumably in contrast with residential and retail’s exclusion) they claimed it had changed significantly because more studio flats and communal areas were being provided in student blocks than before, based on a review of eight privately-provided Exeter schemes among the 62 that have been built here.They also asserted that the two co-living schemes which have been granted planning permission in Exeter provided a “basis for the typologies” even though work has not started on Harlequins shopping centre in the two years and two months since it was approved and work stopped at The Gorge a month ago after contractors pulled out.They said co-living has “specific characteristics and acknowledged difference to others types of development” without explaining these characteristics or who “acknowledged” them.Harlequins: permission was granted for co-living in December 2020 but the scheme has not progressed.The consultants appeared to feel on firmer ground with flats for rent, on the basis there is “at least one build to rent example in Exeter and the council understands that there is a growing interest in this type of development use”.They also cited unspecified “commentary” and said this development type is “different to traditional sale and standard private rent” with a “different intended use”, although they used the same floor sizes, site areas and density assumptions they adopted for flats built for sale as they said there are “limited differences” between the two.While they acknowledged the “limited examples” of flats built for sale in Exeter “as it has not been a common form of development in the city in recent years”, they nevertheless said that it had been “suggested anecdotally” that the current levy rates “could be one of the factors effecting delivery”.They added that their viability assessment of such schemes partly “reflected early design work by the council on potential larger brownfield sites that may come forward in the future”.Paternoster House: permission for flats was granted in March 2020 but the scheme has not progressed.So much for the government’s guidance that “in all cases, the charging authority should be able to explain its approach clearly”.Having supposedly identified “areas of change in the local market” to justify the council’s differential levy charge typology, the consultants then lumped together all four types to estimate development costs.They derived a brownfield benchmark land value of £1.2 million per hectare by taking existing use estimates ranging from £330,000 to £18 million per hectare then saying former commercial premises sites “suggested a narrower range” from £750,000 to £2.3 million per hectare.Acknowledging that “there are situations where brownfield land existing use values in Exeter can be significantly lower (or higher) than DLUHC estimates” they picked out a DLUHC estimate value of £990,000 per hectare and added a 20% uplift on the grounds that urban area benchmarks “tend to be in a range of 10% to 30%” above existing use values.No reference was supplied for the source of this claim, which does not appear to be Exeter-related and is from 2010.The consultants then cited some work they had done in Salford to calculate Exeter co-living build costs, and relied on existing residential development costs to provide values for both flats built for sale and rent despite the council’s insistence that these are different development forms.Unsurprisingly, these calculations yielded development costs that are more or less the same for PBSA and co-living and exactly the same for flats built for sale and rent.Royal Clarence Hotel: permission for flats was granted in October last year but the scheme has not progressed.The consultants also struggled to provide local evidence for their assumptions about unit mixes, sizes and values for each of the council’s new levy charge types.They said unit mixes and sizes had been “devised for each typology using Nationally Described Space Standards plus housing delivery including Land Registry/EPC data and planning applications” even though there space standards do not apply to PBSA or co-living and there are hardly any applications or delivery data for Exeter co-living or flats built for rent or sale.They then combined their development cost calculations with their unit mix, size and values assumptions to derive net levy “headroom” per square metre after all costs and developer profits are deducted in several hypothetical examples of each charge type.They derived PBSA unit mixes, sizes and values from their review of local privately-provided blocks to price bedrooms in cluster flats at £8,344 per annum and studios at £10,963.Their figures showed that all three hypothetical schemes were viable with significant headroom to support a community infrastructure levy charge.The consultants “assumed” co-living unit mixes and sizes and derived values by adding a 10% uplift on PBSA rents on the grounds that “co-living values are not yet available within Exeter”.The uplift rate came from unspecified “locations elsewhere” although the consultants also noted that “the uplift can be in the region of 30%”. No evidence was supplied to justify their uplift reduction, which significantly tilted the assessment.Co-living studios were thus priced at £11,883 per annum, which is at the bottom end of the price range advertised at The Gorge last year before the development ran into trouble.Some rooms were priced at £13,272 per annum, which would equate with a 23% uplift using the consultant’s approach.Their figures again showed that all three hypothetical schemes were viable with substantial headroom to support a levy charge.Unit mixes and sizes for flats built for rent were unsurprisingly “considered likely” to be similar to unit mixes and sizes for flats built for sale, while values were based on market rents.The consultants didn’t specify where from, but they cannot be Exeter rental figures.They derived an average rent of £15,000 per annum on this basis, but as this figure includes ostensibly affordable units offered at a 20% discount the market rate flats would cost more.Again, their figures showed that all three hypothetical schemes were viable with substantial headroom to support a levy charge, although the ten storey scheme modelled at PBSA densities appears implausible as it would alone deliver more housing units than were built across the whole city in 2020-21.The consultants based their unit mixes and sizes for flats built for sale on “the average size of delivered flats over the past five years” and derived values from “an analysis of new build Land Registry data” from November 2015 to November 2021.They acknowledged that the Exeter data was very thin. Of the 142 values they found over this six year period, 43 came from a single address in Burnthouse Lane and another 22 from a single address in Southernhay. Another nine addresses supplied more than three values each.They also admitted that at time of their March 2022 assessment only eight new-build flats were being advertised for sale in Exeter in four luxury schemes in highly desirable locations which were all unrepresentative. One agent was trying to sell a flat in Colleton Crescent for £1,250,000.The consultants did not consider whether these schemes reflected an overheating Exeter property market in which values from seven years before could not be relied upon for viability calculations.They instead came up with an average price of £257,333 for a new-build flat and concluded that most of their hypothetical flats for sale schemes were not viable, except that provided only limited headroom which would not be enough to support a levy charge.King Billy: permission was granted for PBSA in April 2018 and renewed in June 2021 but the scheme has not progressed.The consultants derived several conclusions from their calculations. The unsurprising finding that co-living development is more profitable than building flats, given that space standards apply to the latter but not the former, enabling its very high densities, was enough to conclude that co-living constitutes a “different model of housing provision”, justifying the council’s typology.Similarly, the unsurprising finding that building flats for rent is more profitable than selling them provided the consultants with reason to conclude these two forms of development were also “clearly distinct in viability terms”, again justifying the council’s typology.They then said that levy charges for both co-living and flats for rent must be “considered carefully within the context of an immature market in terms of this form of development in Exeter” without acknowledging that the lack of local evidence for either should preclude differential rates for both.Vaughan Road: Exeter City Living was granted permission for flats in February 2020 but after demolition paid for by a government grant contractors pulled out. The project was originally due for completion in November 2020.Nor did the consultants compare FlatRent 1 with FlatSale 4, or FlatRent 2 with FlatSale 5, to examine the wide viability variations their figures yielded between each pair of schemes despite each having the same number of storeys and units and identical densities.Their findings nevertheless strongly suggest that the key difference between them is profit derived from rent extraction, suggesting in turn that other forms of residential development for sale should be included in the levy review to test the assumptions on which it was based.Why? Because the consultants’ conclusion that higher-density PBSA is more profitable than lower density co-living strongly suggests that higher-density residential development for sale would also be more profitable than its typical lower-density equivalent, yet there is plentiful real-world evidence that lower-density residential development remains sufficiently profitable to be viable.Of course in the real world, whichever of the council’s policy-driven types happens to apply, many developers are currently struggling with viability for a wide range of reasons.Major and minor developments of all four council types are currently stalled in Exeter, while others are going through umpteen design iterations, applications are not appearing on schedule and even Exeter City Living, which is in the unique position of being underwritten with public money to develop council-owned land is failing to make progress on a long list of sites.Applications to convert existing buildings are instead appearing as developers seek to mitigate new-build risks while volume builders continue to bring forward low density residential development for sale in Newcourt, Pinhoe, Monkerton and elsewhere as before.Belle Isle depot: the council site sale to Exeter City Living was approved in September 2021 but pre-application consultation did not take place until last November. A planning application may be pending.None of this Exeter figures in the council’s levy review. Nor do the challenges facing the development sector, the changes that have taken place in retail, the wider economic context, the prospect of a drop in University of Exeter student numbers or Exeter’s housing affordability crisis.The consultants, undeterred, proposed differential levy charge rates based on their figures. They said a buffer between the calculated levy headroom and the charge rate should be applied, following government guidance, but offered little insight on how to apply it other than saying: “The buffers used in other CIL studies have varied, but generally fall around 30-50%”.They also said, also without providing any evidence, that “some councils (and examiners) have come to a view that a CIL rate which is set at no more than 5% of GDV [Gross Development Value] is generally acceptable and unlikely to put development at risk whether a site is viable or not”.Taken together these statements imply that a rate of 5% of GDV that does not exceed 70% of the calculated levy headroom would be optimal.However they went on to propose a rate of £150/m2 for PBSA, 26% of the headroom and half the smallest buffer applied according to the “other CIL studies”. Charging 70% of the headroom would mean a rate of £411/m2 instead. This equates to 11.5% of GDV, but the consultants elsewhere admitted that PBSA market values in Exeter are much higher than the figures they used.They proposed a rate of £50/m2 for co-living, just 24% of the headroom and only 1.4% of GDV. Charging 70% of the headroom would mean £169/m2 at 4.6% of GDV. Their justification, despite its essential similarity to PBSA, was that co-living is a “relatively untried form of development in the city”.Exe Water Sports Association: pre-application consultation is taking place nearly three years after government funding to demolish the site for development was granted to Exeter City Living.The consultants proposed the same levy rate for flats built for rent, £50/m2, for the same reasons. This is only 15% of the headroom at 1.8% of GDV if the implausible ten storey scheme is ignored. Charging 41% of the available headroom would mean raising £138/m2 at 5% of GDV.The rate proposed for flats built for sale is nil, supposedly reflecting the “marginal viability for this form of development in Exeter” even though the modelling shows that medium-sized such schemes are not only viable, but very profitable. Flatsale 3 yields £2,243,902 in developer profit. As new developments only have to be two units tall to qualify for this zero rate, we should presumably expect a rash of applications to build maisonettes.All these proposed levy charges gift large buffers in favour of the kinds of development the council wants to see and deliver via Exeter City Living and Exeter City Futures’ new development corporation for its own financial benefit.The consultants’ only justification for the generosity is that the proposed rates “could be higher with a reduced buffer, however they are already generally an increase on what the council is currently collecting”. This, of course, is not the case: flats built for rent and sale will both have significantly lower charges applied under the new levy than now.Mary Arches Street car park: redevelopment has been on Exeter City Living’s delivery programme for nearly three years. A scheme outline may appear this year.The uses to which people put housing are essentially similar irrespective of design, configuration, density, location or their employment status. Most dwellings provide space to eat, rest and sleep with kitchen, bathroom, toilet and storage facilities of one sort or another, whether shared with others or not, whether students live there or not.The council’s levy charge typology nevertheless insists that there are essential differences between PBSA and co-living on the one hand and flats that are built for rent and for sale on the other.It obscures significant similarities between its charge types while ignoring its findings that viability differences largely boil down to development densities (on the brownfield sites on which most of Exeter’s future development will come forward).PBSA and co-living have essentially similar forms, and are treated the same way by national planning policy. The council’s consultants even confirm that PBSA and co-living are becoming increasingly identical as the former moves away from providing cluster flats to studios.Flats built for rent and sale already have identical forms, both falling under the C2 use class. Their interchangeability is exemplified in Exeter City Living’s Vaughan Road development, where flats that were to be built for sale are now intended for rent instead.At the same time flats built for rent, co-living and PBSA are all built for rent, and judged viable by the council’s consultants, while flats built for sale are judged unviable although many will be purchased to be rented out, given Exeter’s very significant affordability problems, at which point they will become just as viable as those that were built to rent in the first place.The council’s levy charge typology is not just insufficiently evidenced, it is unfit for purpose. Differential levy charge rates that reflect development densities and scale, rather than notional occupancy status, would be far more effective at capturing viability headroom to help pay for community infrastructure than the council’s policy-driven approach.They would raise money from developments in proportion with their infrastructure impacts too.A new levy charge structured this way could be accompanied by new planning policy to impose (and enforce) conditions which ensure that housing that is built for residential occupation and ownership in Exeter stays that way, preventing its instant conversion to rental housing on completion at no cost.At the same time, if the council were serious about co-living being occupied by residents instead of students, it could impose (and enforce) planning conditions that prohibit student occupancy, just as it imposes conditions that require student occupancy of PBSA.Then it would actually deliver on its currently ostensible commitment not to build PBSA on its own land when it grants permission for co-living on sites likes Harlequins shopping centre.CityPoint: council redevelopment plans are still on the drawing board more than five years after they were conceived in response to the failure of the previous scheme for the site.When Exeter City Council introduced community infrastructure levy charges in 2013 they were expected to contribute £39 million towards a £92 million funding shortfall over the thirteen years between then and 2026: 42% of the total.It is now proposing revised levy charges in the context of a ballooning infrastructure funding shortfall that is expected to be much larger than the thirteen year total even though it only covers the four years to 2026.And the new levy charges are only expected to raise £25 million towards these costs, just 27% of the shortfall. Without including any of the Liveable Exeter development infrastructure that was ignored in the levy review.If the each of proposed levy charges was increased as outlined above, three times as much money to fund needed infrastructure would be raised. Not enough to close the enormous funding gap completely but certainly enough to make a significant difference. And that is without also increasing or otherwise amending other levy charges that were excluded from the assessment.Council leader Phil Bialyk refused to say, when questioned, who decided not to implement the full council’s 2019 decision to commission a complete review of the current charging schedule. He claimed that a partial levy review had been approved, but this is not what council records say.

The many questions that remain around the partial review make a clear case for a comprehensive review based on substantive evidence of tested Exeter development forms that has not been manipulated to reflect the council’s development policy objectives or benefit companies in which the council has an interest.Unpacking the assumptions imposed on the existing work to properly assess the available local evidence for differential charging rates, and including all forms of development as well as considering strategic site zoning, would also give the council time to align the new levy with the new local plan, a proper draft of which is expected later this year.This will replace the ramshackle first draft that the council rushed out prematurely last year, which council officers knew would need rewriting from scratch when it was published, in another local plan consultation that is to take place this year that could address a new levy at the same time.The new plan’s evidence base is substantial, more or less complete, and will hardly change before the plan reaches examination stage: it would provide a much better basis on which to address Exeter’s future infrastructure needs than a plan that is more than ten years old.As government guidance says: “Where practical, there are benefits to undertaking infrastructure planning for the purpose of plan making and setting the levy at the same time. A charging authority may use a draft plan if they are proposing a joint examination of their relevant plan and their levy charging schedule.”The council could still choose to align its new community infrastructure levy with its new local plan. It’s not too late to do so, and the new levy charges are not expected to bring in any more money than the current charges in any case."

"content" : "Devon County Council is expected to increase spending by just over 10% next financial year, with nearly half of the net inflation-level increase allocated to its underperforming children’s services.The Conservative-run council intends to spend £696 million on service delivery from April, an increase of £66 million over this year, with final budget approval due next month.Children’s services would receive an additional £32 million and adult social care an additional £27 million.Spending on climate change, environment and transport would increase by £2.8 million and public health and communities by just £1 million.However £50 million of spending reductions in other service areas are also planned.Devon County Council headquarters at County HallDevon County Council’s children’s services were judged as inadequate by Ofsted in January 2020 and the Department of Education issued a statutory direction ordering the council to make improvements.Further Ofsted monitoring and a review by the Children’s Commissioner for England followed.In July last year a joint report by Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission highlighted significant concerns about Devon County Council’s services for children with special education needs and disabilities (SEND) following an inspection.Devon County Council acknowledged its failings but in October the Department of Education found that while there had been some improvement the council was “still failing to perform to an adequate standard”.Then in December the county council was told that its children’s services were considered the “third or fourth worst in the country” and would be taken into special measures and taken over by an independent trust if improvements were not made.

It aims to support and encourage pollination by planting wild flowers and leaving grass to grow long.A dedicated map marks the positions of the many varieties of trees growing along its three mile route and shows whether each produces fruits, nuts or berries and at what time of year.Local volunteers help take care of the orchard, which now numbers around 200 trees.Orchard wassailing has been practised in cider producing counties, including Devon, for many centuries. The first recorded mention is from 1585 in Kent.The winter ceremony is believed to promote a good apple crop the following spring.

"content" : "EXETER CITY FUTURES published the agenda for its last board meeting on 30 January, two months after the meeting was held. It says it is “committed to being completely transparent and open about the things that are discussed at board meetings”. No minutes were included.New figures show that 2.2 million people used EXETER CENTRAL RAILWAY STATION in the year to March 2022, making it the 155th busiest of 2,569 UK railway stations and (slightly) busier than Exeter St David’s.DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL is not making sufficient progress with its children’s services since they were judged inadequate in January 2020 according to the latest Ofsted monitoring report which found that key areas still require significant change and serious issues remain.The opening of MARSH BARTON RAILWAY STATION has been delayed yet again, to “this spring”, putting project completion more than six years behind schedule.EXETER CHIEFS rugby club has reintroduced its offensive “tomahawk chop” chant during games at Sandy Park, where it is being played over the PA system, despite seeking to rehabilitate its reputation after a long-running controversy over its misappropriation of indigenous and Native American imagery.Meanwhile the club’s application to EXETER CITY COUNCIL to vary the stadium’s license to enable it to become a music venue as well as host to boxing, wrestling, theatre and films is to be decided at a meeting on Monday 30 January.The UNIVERSITY OF EXETER has submitted detailed plans for its 1,700 bed West Park redevelopment of 50,000m2 of student accommodation. They include ten storey blocks which are two storeys taller than agreed when outline permission was granted in May 2021.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has again breached local government transparency legislation by failing to give required notice of its intention to hold an Executive meeting in private.Contractors have pulled out of controversial Gladstone Road co-living block THE GORGE, leaving works stalled.Devon LEVELLING-UP round two funding has been announced, with Exmouth Gateway and a maritime research centre in Appledore to receive £16 million each and £13.5 million for a new railway station on the eastern edge of Okehampton to be called Okehampton Parkway.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has collected thousands of council tax payments that were due on 25 January nine days early. It has refunded the payments and confirmed it will reimburse those who have incurred bank charges as a result of its error on application.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has cancelled a planning committee meeting that was expected to approve controversial developments including 350 dwellings at St Bridget horticulture nursery on Old Rydon Lane and a 26-bed student accommodation block on Howell Road after failing to inform objectors that the meeting was taking place.DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL approved revised proposals to make active travel infrastructure in Queen Street permanent at a meeting on 16 January. They include a reduction in footway width and increase in carriageway width, compared with previous proposals, to enable the reintroduction of two-way motor traffic. The revised scheme does not provide any cycling infrastructure but does include a new loading bay which will be set into the pavement. The same meeting approved a 700-metre £1.55 million cycling infrastructure scheme on Rifford Road. It will not impede motor vehicle movement but will entail the removal of sixteen parking spaces.LIBRARIES UNLIMITED has become the latest local organisation to launch a lottery in order to raise funds for public service delivery.EXETER CITY LIVING is consulting on proposals to redevelop the Exe Water Sports Association site at the head of Exeter Ship Canal, which includes the Ride On headquarters and the boat yard. Responses are invited until 27 January.Proposals to convert a 3,000m2 five storey office block on New North Road known as BEAUFORT HOUSE to a 107-bed student accommodation facility have been submitted to the city council for approval.The MET OFFICE has confirmed that 2022 was the world’s sixth warmest year since 1850, and the ninth in succession in which global average temperatures have equalled or exceeded 1.0°C above pre-industrial levels. It also forecast that 2023 will be the tenth consecutive such year.Revised proposals to develop a student/co-living complex on the site of HEAVITREE ROAD POLICE STATION AND MAGISTRATES’ COURT have been submitted to the city council for approval at a meeting on 20 February. The scheme’s eighth design iteration provides 964 rooms and reduces overall building heights by “up to one metre”.EXETER CITY COUNCIL figures show low levels of attendance at councillor training sessions – fewer than half attended a local plan briefing and only a quarter turned up for a communications session – but near 100% participation in junkets at parks and waterways.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has imposed a 7% rent and service charge increase on council housing tenants – the maximum permitted.EXETER CITY COUNCIL will have to make net savings of £3.835 million next year and reduce its reserves to a minimum despite an increase in central government funding according to 2023-24 budget proposals. Repairs and maintenance of council-owned property will be cut back significantly, resulting in further degradation and closure risks, but a £10.6 million loan to Exeter City Living will go ahead.The council’s executive committee has agreed to postpone delivery of the 2023-24 EXETER CITY LIVING business plan until a fortnight after the financial year to which it applies begins – five months late – to allow time to appoint contractors for the first phase of the council-owned company’s long-delayed Vaughan Road development.The OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS has published new local authority-level education statistics which show level four qualification attainment among Exeter residents at less than half the rate in the highest scoring area.The OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS has also published new local authority-level housing statistics which show lower levels of social housing and owner occupation in Exeter than across England and Wales, and much lower levels of renewable energy-powered domestic heating systems. It also found that Exeter has the third highest proportion of people who used a second address in the UK after Oxford and Cambridge, reflecting the city’s very high student population levels.The MET OFFICE has confirmed that 2022 was the UK’s hottest year on record and that climate change made its 10°C-plus average temperature around 160 times more likely. An accompanying study concluded that what would have been a 1-in-500 year temperature in a natural climate is now likely every three to four years.DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL has submitted proposals for a new electricity substation to serve the 2,500-home South West Exeter extension.£1 million works to make a temporary MAGDALEN ROAD ONE-WAY SYSTEM permanent despite decisive public support for a low traffic street have begun. They are expected to take around four months to complete.DEVON COUNTY COUNCIL is to receive a £580,000 share of a £32.9 million government grant intended to create a “national network of active travel experts” to support the development of cycling and walking infrastructure."

"content" : "When Exeter City Council celebrates its ranking in a laudatory press releases it is usually just amplifying content marketing messages concocted by companies which want free publicity.Most recently we saw this in a Hampshire ceramic tile wholesaler’s judgement that Exeter is the UK’s third most aesthetic city and in the council marketing department’s translation of Heavitree Pleasure Ground’s appearance on a list of 74 parks into the headline “Heavitree park wins local favourite award in nationwide poll”.The council has been susceptible to this form of flattery for a long time (see Irwin Mitchell “UK Powerhouse” reports and the Leicester builder’s merchant). However when a headline claim about Exeter is based on peer-reviewed academic research with a robust methodology, as it was last month, simply dismissing the hype as marketing guff is not enough.In this case the headline was “Scientists have named Exeter city centre as the greenest in Britain based on tree cover and the presence of parks”, as correctly presented by BBC news, although this was subsequently misrepresented as “Exeter is the greenest city in Britain” on social media by a BBC journalist then repeated in that form by Exeter Labour Party and two of its councillors.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            The substance of the story was also (more or less) correctly presented Sky News and The Times alongside around 150 other news channels, most of which got the headline about right, although The Guardian got it wrong with “Study reveals Britain’s greenest cities”.Local media fell into the same trap. Devon Live went with “Exeter named greenest urban city in Britain” (repeated by another journalist) and Grow Exeter had “Exeter named the greenest city in Britain” (although it was only the headlines that were substantively incorrect in both stories).Exeter City Council’s marketing team went for a metaphor, “Exeter top of the tree for green open spaces”, which also misrepresented the source material, and added misleading context for good measure in the body too.It may be true that “Exeter enjoys a range of green open spaces including six valley parks managed by Devon Wildlife Trust, numerous parks, sports pitches, 1,400 allotments and a number of leafy cemeteries”, but this has next to nothing to do with the research on which the story was based.Exeter wasn’t ranked top for tree cover, either.Distribution of the 68 urban centres included in the research study.Includes material licensed under Creative Commons.So what were the research findings, by academics from the University of Sheffield and elsewhere, on which the story was based?Their objective was to map and characterise the green attributes of urban centres based on three measures: vegetation cover, tree cover and the amount of publicly accessible green space.They identified 68 urban centres in municipalities with populations of at least 100,000 using Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) spatial data that captures the location of retail areas. Several London centres were included on this basis and Northern Ireland was excluded because of insufficient data.Exeter’s city centre retail area was ranked top for vegetation cover, second for tree cover and third for publicly accessible green space. Combining these rankings placed it first overall.Several of its central green spaces were included in the study, although the retail area boundaries meant only parts of some were counted. A total of a little over 34,000m2 of green space was identified inside the city centre retail area.Land beside the cathedral accounted for 55% of the total and Southernhay nearly 22%. Both were included in their entirety.Publicly-accessible city centre retail area green space in St Bartholomew’s Cemetery.Part of Rougemont Gardens and parts of Northernhay Gardens were also included, accounting for 20% together, and a corner of Friernhay made up just under 3%.A tiny 46m2 triangle in St Bartholomew’s Cemetery and 2m2 of St David’s churchyard were also inside the boundary, if difficult to access on the ground.Members of the public were quick to observe not only that the study concerned city centres, not whole cities, but also that a lot of these spaces are not really part of Exeter’s city centre retail area.They also pointed out that the research results largely reflect the inclusion of land around an 11th century cathedral and castle and a 13th century meadow in the retail area.That most of cathedral green has been covered with market stalls for the past month and a fun fair is nearly filling Northernhay Gardens did not escape people either.Contains ESRC CDRC data inc.

But did the Sheffield academics intend their findings to be repurposed to help sell the city to wealthy downshifters?They said their research work was concerned with the role access to green spaces plays in human health and social equity, with a particular focus on urban retail centres as people from a wide range of backgrounds spend a lot of time in them.They emphasised the importance of socioecological justice, “the equal and fair distribution of environmental resources and benefits”, a concept that is about as far away from the local Labour leadership’s thinking as Sheffield is from Exeter.Their explanation for Exeter’s results on their research metrics was that “Exeter, a small city in England’s remote south-west, largely avoided the rapid industrial growth of better-connected cities” while “places like Glasgow and Sheffield were massive industrial powerhouses with considerable urban sprawl, though they do still have luscious parks outside of their city centres”.As many others have also observed, they said the principal drivers of Exeter’s results were “differences in historical development”. So not, then, the actions of the local Labour party.Contains CDRC data, an ESRC data investment, under project ID CDRC 498-01, ES/L011840/1; ES/L011891/1; public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0; satellite imagery © 2022 CNES/Airbus, Getmapping plc, Infoterra Ltd &amp;amp; Bluesky, Maxar Technologies.Publicly-accessible Exeter green spaces (and sports facilities) in green.Exeter city centre retail area as per 2017 CDRC data in orange.Exeter city centre retail area as per 2022 CDRC data in blue.Intersection of green spaces and retail area as per 2022 data in yellow.The research paper was published on 23 November but had been submitted in October the previous year, a consequence of slow academic journal peer review and publication processes.The CDRC city centre retail area boundaries on which it was based were from 2017, based on a 2015 retail units location dataset which was based, in turn, on retail centre locations from a 2005 government report.In March this year, the CDRC retail centre boundaries were replaced with significantly updated data, which was revised again this month. These provide a very different and clearly more accurate account of what constitutes Exeter’s city centre retail area – and also exclude most of the green space that the 2017 data ruled in.The Sheffield academics didn’t have access to this data when they performed their research, and we don’t know how Exeter city centre would compare with the other 67 urban areas were the research performed again with the new and more accurate boundaries.Exeter Observer always tries to dig deep, but we’re locally-focussed public interest journalists and not a university research team (although we couldn’t resist taking a look at the boundary changes in central London, which are significant too).However we can say that the size of the publicly-accessible Exeter city centre green space according to the 2022 CDRC data is just over 8,000m2 – less than a quarter of the area included in the 2017 CDRC area boundaries.Another view of Cathedral Green, looking westward through the trees.Whatever the revised national results would be, we’re sure that misleading marketing does Exeter more harm than good when it sends housing costs soaring past what residents relying on the city’s economy can afford by setting them against the much higher spending power of downshifters from the south east and student parents who live elsewhere.Rather than seeking to claim credit for a city centre layout that was established centuries ago, we think it behoves Exeter Labour to take responsibility for the effects its decisions have had over the past ten years, both around the way it promotes the city and the impact of the university’s expansion on the city’s private rented housing stock, nearly three quarters of which is now occupied by students.The council may not intend to address Exeter’s economic and social problems by displacing people who already live here with much wealthier incomers but its policies and practices, which prioritise the extraction of wealth by remote financial interests over its local creation and retention, are having that effect.This cautionary story is also a reminder of the importance of examining the basis of public claims, especially when they are being made by politicians about their performance. The Sheffield academics interrogate the data on which their conclusions depend. Exeter’s leaders have no excuse not to do the same."

"content" : "Exeter City Council is to launch a local lottery as a means of “empowering and enabling communities to help themselves”.Despite the 2005 Gambling Act and the sector regulator it established defining lotteries as form of gambling, Labour councillor Martin Pearce has repeatedly insisted that the lottery, which he proposed, will instead promote “incentivised giving”.The council draw will be classified as a “large society lottery” which will require an operating license as it will have a jackpot prize of £25,000. The odds of winning this prize will be 1,000,000 to 1 as it would require correctly matching all six numbers in a weekly draw.Five first or last matches would win £2,000 at odds of 55,556 to 1, four £250 at 5,556 to 1 and three £25 at 556 to 1. Two matches would win three lottery tickets, worth £3, at odds of 56 to 1. The council presents these together as “the odds of winning any prize are 50 to 1”.It intends Gatherwell, a commercial operator which manages more than 100 UK local authority lotteries, to deliver most aspects of its lottery, including covering the cost of prizes however unlikely it is that anyone would win the jackpot.Gatherwell local authority lottery prizes and oddsThe council claims that the lottery “proceeds will stay in the city”. These don’t include the 20% of ticket sales revenue the operator keeps (of which 15% is payable to the government as VAT) or the 20% it collects towards the cost of prize payouts.It’s not clear whether the second tranche could partly translate into additional profit for the company: unlike Premium Bonds, prize distribution is not a function of fund size.Lottery players will choose whether some or all of the remaining 60% of ticket sales revenue goes to a council-nominated organisation via its existing grants programme. If they select a beneficiary themselves, from a shortlist of options also chosen by the council, the council still keeps 17%.All it has so far said about the choice of beneficiaries is that officers and the executive portfolio holder, currently Martin Pearce, would pick them.The West Devon and South Hams SeaMoor Lotto is cited as a local exemplar. Its terms and conditions impose a range of eligibility restrictions and give the council powers to reject applications and remove beneficiaries without justification.The council also says that lottery operators are not supposed to be a “vehicle for profit for commercial organisations”. Gatherwell has been owned by Australian corporation Jumbo Interactive since 2019, and was expected to generate AS$4.6 million in revenue for the parent company during its first eighteen months of ownership alone.Jumbo Interactive lottery revenues for the year to June 2022 were AS$91,098,000. Gatherwell transaction values increased 31% to £12,175,000 as it expanded its coverage of UK local authorities in search of market dominance.Jumbo Interactive 2022 annual report financial highlightsMartin Pearce said the lottery would be of particular benefit to “organisations which haven’t got the capacity to fundraise themselves” which he characterised as those which “don’t have a team going out trying to secure legacies from people” or which “might be a small charity or even a community group that doesn’t even have any paid staff and is reliant completely on volunteers”.He also said that it would “give them a mechanism for donating” when one is not otherwise available, echoing the council’s statement that it would be a “potentially more effective facility with which to fundraise” which would give “opportunities to smaller groups”.No evidence at all was presented to support these claims at any of the three council meetings that have discussed the proposals.It has not been explained, for example, why lottery players would pick organisations of which they have not previously heard as beneficiaries in preference to established high-profile local charities.Nor has an assessment of the likely impact of a council-run lottery on other local organisations which already run lotteries to raise money taken place. The Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Hospicare, Devon Air Ambulance and, as council leader Phil Bialyk has highlighted, the Donkey Sanctuary all do so.The importance of gift aid, which allows charities (and community amateur sports clubs) to claim an extra 25% of the value of UK taxpayer donations, has not been considered either. Eligible organisations receive £125 for every £100 donated this way, which is more than double the £60 they would receive for the same sum bet on the lottery.And the value of direct relationships between community and voluntary sector organisations and their supporters has been ignored by the council too, unless a desire to intervene between them and interfere with who gets what is part of its intention.Gatherwell local authority lottery coverageWithout knowing whether a council lottery will incentivise additional giving or simply redistribute and reduce the value of existing donations, perhaps asking how much money is at stake is a way to estimate the extent of any damage it might do.The council report on its proposals does not say. When asked to give details by Green Party councillor Amy Sparling and pressed by Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell, Martin Pearce said the council hoped to raise “somewhere between £40,000 to £80,000” each year on sales of “2,000-ish tickets a week”.Selling 2,000 lottery tickets each week would yield £62,400 a year for local organisations and £41,600 for Gatherwell, of which half would pay for prizes provided people win them.The same money donated via gift aid to an independent trust dedicated to supporting under-resourced Exeter community and voluntary organisations, an alternative approach suggested by Green Party councillor Diana Moore, it would yield £130,000 a year and none of the money would end up in Australia.However SeaMoor Lotto, which is marketed to a larger population than Exeter, only expects to raise £24,000 this year having reached 761 ticket sales a week after four and a half years of operation.With launch costs of around £5,000 and ongoing costs which “would not exceed £5,000 per annum” an Exeter City Council lottery must be at risk of making very little.Martin Pearce nevertheless expects it to significantly increase the size and reach of the council community grants scheme. He said: “One of the exciting things about this lottery is it means we’re going to have an expanded community grants scheme. The fund will be larger than it is currently so we’ll be able to touch more organisations in the city.”The council gave 167 grants to 124 local organisations last year, spending a total of just over £964,000 across its existing programmes.It underspent by £27,500. It’s not clear why it didn’t use this money to “widen the pool of organisations” that benefit from its programmes in the way Martin Pearce intends, although its demanding eligibility criteria may have something to do with it.All applicants must, among other things, show how they address one or more key council priorities, demonstrate how they meet “the demands of development across the city” and prove that they have community support by providing evidence of targeted consultation and engagement.They must also provide an impact report that demonstrates achievement, promote the council’s involvement and give the council the right to share all the provided information in its publicity materials. Applicants cannot appeal council grant decisions.The council has not said how many Exeter community and voluntary organisations it has identified which can meet these criteria but do not already receive its support and lack the means to accept donations from supporters while nevertheless being eligible to receive lottery funding.This entails possessing a bank account, being formally constituted with a management committee with a minimum of three members that meets on a regular basis and being able to put together a detailed lottery promotion plan.The yield from a council lottery might only be small beer in the context of its existing grants programme – even more so when £3,683,000 of National Lottery grants to Exeter organisations are factored in – but its potential to cause harm is still real.A recent Public Health England review which “analysed the best available international research evidence on risk factors and gambling-related harms” found that 0.5% of the population reached the threshold to be considered problem gamblers, while another 3.8% are at risk.It also found that 7% are negatively affected by someone else’s gambling. Women are more likely to be affected this way than men and the most severe impacts of problem gambling are felt most by immediate family members.In economic terms, the review found that the burden of harmful gambling cost around 9% of the profits it generates. It also identified three themes that highlighted opposing views between commercial and non-commercial stakeholders – people who work for the gambling industry and people involved in healthcare and charity work as well as those with relevant lived experience.The first group believed harmful gambling was caused by co-morbidities or a tendency toward addiction, that its is only experienced by a minority of gamblers and no-one else, and that its prevention and reduction should be focussed on individual interventions and treatment.The second group thought that gambling harms are caused by gambling products and environments, that they can be experienced by any gamblers and also indirectly by families and society, and that tackling them requires a whole systems, public health approach.The council’s risk assessment of the proposals did not address any of these issues, focussing instead on potential financial, reputational, political and commercial risks to itself.It thinks that limiting bets to a maximum of £20, taking payment by card or direct debit and not selling single tickets or tickets for a draw on the same day, precluding instant reward, is sufficient to mitigate the risks of problem gambling.However there does not appear to be a way to restrict ticket sales to over-sixteens or prevent several members of the same household spending £20 a week each, and the operator has a profit incentive.When Conservative councillor Anne Jobson asked for more detail on safety measures, Labour councillor Duncan Wood responded by saying he was “completely comfortable” with the council’s approach. Martin Pearce said lots of safeguards were in place, adding: “82.5% of people who play these lotteries are from ABC1 social categories”.The suggestion that a high proportion of players from higher social groups entails lower risk of gambling harms appears repeatedly in Gatherwell’s promotional materials. The company’s claims are based on unpublished internal research performed by itself and a single, non-peer reviewed report by a commercial market research company. Martin Pearce described this as “lots of really good research”.Public Health England, in contrast, says that “demographic factors, particularly being male, appear more significant in predicting at-risk gambling behaviour than economic factors such as income, employment and relative deprivation”.It also says that the minority among the most disadvantaged who do gamble have “the highest levels of harmful gambling and they are also the most susceptible to harm”.One might think that, lacking insight into the consequences of launching its own lottery, the council could have consulted Exeter’s voluntary and community sector organisations, many of which deliver essential support to the very people who are at risk of gambling-related harms while also being potential recipients of lottery-financed grants.Martin Pearce has been asked about this several times. He said the council would “explore” a public consultation, although he added that he didn’t think it would be necessary “because there’s been a number of informal discussions” involving “faith groups, community centres, sports organisations, lots of community partners” from which “the overwhelming response has been positive”.When asked whether this approach was consistent with the council’s consultation charter he said “it would probably become appropriate that we’ll follow the formal consultation practices and processes” after the council had approved the lottery plans, although a key principle of the charter is that consultation must take place before decisions are made.Opposition councillors say that lots of Exeter voluntary sector organisations have not been consulted and criticised the limitations of only involving “groups that we happen to know”.The decision to go ahead regardless was taken last week despite Green Party councillor Tess Read’s proposal to instead first assess the likely impact of a lottery on the council, the city’s voluntary sector and those who would buy tickets and their households, then use the assessment as a basis on which to properly consult the public and the voluntary sector about the plans.Labour councillor Yvonne Atkinson described the lottery as a “fantastic opportunity for the people of Exeter and our local voluntary groups” and council leader Phil Bialyk said: “Sometimes, I know it’s difficult, sometimes you’ve just got to trust us a little bit, just a little bit”."

"content" : "Exeter City Futures has falsely claimed that it previously disclosed documents related to Exeter Development Fund after the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) imposed a deadline for its response to Exeter Observer information requests.Jo Yelland, an Exeter City Council director who has worked for the company three days a week since January, responded to the ICO’s deadline by claiming that information requested by Exeter Observer under freedom of information legislation was provided during face-to-face meetings with Exeter City Futures staff.No such meetings were held. Instead, two telephone conversations took place with company staff during which neither disclosed any of the requested information.The requests, which were made in January under the Environmental Information Regulations, were for details of meetings and unpublished documents related to Exeter Development Fund, a private debt-driven Liveable Exeter property development financing scheme that Exeter City Futures has been working on since 2017.The fund came under fire from councillors in July who say it is based on insufficiently-evidenced assumptions and won’t meet Exeter’s housing needs.  Unpublished Exeter Development Fund documents      community engagement model and community challenge plan    stakeholder meetings, sessions and workshops schedule    project stakeholder engagement summary    financial modelling assumptions and feasibility study    JLL development assumptions report    Liveable Exeter site development viability appraisals    LDA Design site development schedules    asset transfer frameworks    detailed risk register    benefits methodology    benefits register  We made the information requests after the publication of a truncated version of the outline business case for the fund for discussion at a council meeting in January.This document, which was marked as a draft despite having been signed off the previous August then clumsily edited to disguise its age, was only shared with councillors after meetings with senior council staff in which Exeter Observer applied pressure to disclose the details of the scheme.We were concerned that councillors and the public had been kept in the dark because of the risks the fund presents to publicly-owned land and property assets, the sale of which it proposes to raise private finance to build thousands of rented flats.Despite then-council leader Pete Edwards committing to the fund nearly five years ago, it has not been mentioned in any of Labour’s local election manifestos since, and current council leader Phil Bialyk said “it was too early in the process to bring forward any detail” when asked about it by Green Party councillor Diana Moore at a meeting on 18 October last year.October 2021 Exeter Development Fund workshop agenda, not supplied by Exeter City FuturesHowever a Liveable Exeter Place Board meeting that the council had repurposed as a “deep dive on the proposed fund” to “establish a common understanding on the work that is being done”, to which board members and their finance directors and estates managers were invited, had already taken place.The council’s invitation to attend the three-hour workshop “devoted to this single issue” included a copy of the same truncated version of the outline business case for the fund, minus clumsy edits and marked as version 1.0, that was presented to councillors for the first time, as a draft, the following January.The minutes of this meeting are among the information we requested.A longer version of the outline business case for the fund was subsequently published by Global City Futures, Exeter City Futures’ parent company, in May – but this does not contain the information we requested either.In July we made a formal complaint to the ICO about Exeter City Futures’ failure to meet its statutory obligations. In October the ICO notified the company that it was a public authority under the Environmental Information Regulations, and so subject to their provisions, and gave it ten working days to respond to our information requests.The company’s response was to falsely claim it had provided the information nine months before, putting it on course for a collision with the Information Commissioner’s Office in the new year.October 2021 Exeter Development Fund workshop presentation, not supplied by Exeter City FuturesExeter City Futures’ obligations under the Environmental Information Regulations include routinely and proactively publishing a wide range of information.This includes any “policies, plans and procedures relating to the environment” as well as “facts and analyses of facts that are relevant and important to major environmental policy proposals” such as Exeter Development Fund and its discredited Net Zero Exeter plan.The company also says its board is “committed to being completely transparent and open about the things that are discussed”.But when it published the minutes of its August meeting – at the end of September – they referred to but did not include an accompanying report which “identified areas of weakness in relation to governance” that needed “immediate attention”.When we asked for the unpublished report it appeared on the company website a week later as if it had been there all along.Exeter City Futures declared public funding to the end of 2022. Sources: Exeter City Council, Exeter City Futures.Among other issues, the report found that there was “no formal procurement or other arrangement in place between Exeter City Futures and Global City Futures for work Global City Futures, as a commercial consultancy, may undertake on behalf of Exeter City Futures partners”.These partners include Exeter City Council, the University of Exeter, Exeter College and the Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust – it is now more than a year since there has been a Devon County Council board member – and this work includes Exeter Development Fund, for which the council transferred £38,000 to the company during the 2012-22 financial year alone.In addition, despite Exeter City Futures’ board agreeing that Global City Futures staff could “work on joint contracts with Exeter City Futures to avoid the need for Exeter City Futures to pay VAT on work undertaken by Global City Futures on Exeter Development Fund”, the report found that “there were no delegated powers in place to allow any officer to actually sign joint contracts”.It said that there was “no real demarcation about who is the actual employer” and added that as the motivation for the arrangement “appeared to be VAT avoidance” it “could lead to reputational risks for Exeter City Futures board members”.If the company’s board has met to assess progress on addressing these risks we wouldn’t know: no records of any meetings have since been published.

Subscribe freeMeanwhile Exeter City Futures’ inability to deliver Exeter’s 2030 net zero policy is finally becoming apparent to council members and officers, three years after passing it, even though the greenhouse gas inventory it commissioned from the University of Exeter misrepresents the scale of the city’s emissions.In September council climate change portfolio holder Duncan Wood admitted that Exeter City Futures had “limited resources to explore opportunities and drive the collaboration between stakeholders and residents to make the range of significant changes needed” and that the company’s approach to decarbonisation had “not been built on a credible budget and delivery plan”.Last month council CEO Karime Hassan, who also began working at Exeter City Futures in January alongside Jo Yelland, acknowledged that Exeter City Futures has neither the “funding or legal powers to effect change”.However he also said that Exeter City Futures is now “taking the time to look at what needs to be done now to hit 2030 targets for Exeter” by holding yet another series of workshops, echoing his July proposal to “invite” the company “to reflect on the challenges of resourcing the step change in activity to meet the net zero 2030 goal and to suggest options for meeting these challenges”.This is not the sort of circular economy the city needs to tackle the climate crisis – Exeter City Futures has been responsible for city decarbonisation since July 2019.As his and Jo Yelland’s £125,000 secondment to the company comes to an end he has an opportunity during his last days in the job to address its persistent evasion of scrutiny. He could commit the company to routine, proactive publication of the environmental information it holds and release the information we requested back in January for all to see.As with the unelected and unaccountable Liveable Exeter Place Board, which meets in private without publishing its proceedings and for which he is also responsible, the council should not facilitate the development of major policy proposals with the potential to affect everyone who lives and works in Exeter without telling them what it is up to."

"content" : "Nurses in Exeter are taking part in the first of two days of industrial action in NHS trusts across England, Wales and Northern Island following the government’s refusal to enter pay negotiations.Strikes planned in Scotland have been paused for consultation on a revised pay offer from the Scottish government, which deals directly with health service pay instead of employing an arms-length review body.The Royal College of Nursing, which has been campaigning for fair pay for nurses since August 2020, said that today’s strikes will involve around 100,000 nursing staff.These are the first such strikes in NHS history. A second strike is planned for Tuesday and further strike action with wider impact is expected in January unless the government agrees to negotiate.Striking nurses at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital entrance in Barrack RoadThe strikes follow health secretary Steve Barclay’s announcement earlier this year that NHS staff in England would get a 4% pay increase – a real-terms pay cut against retail price inflation of 11%.The Royal College of Nursing, which is seeking pay rises of 5% above inflation, balloted its 300,000 members in response. Nursing staff at the majority of NHS employers voted in favour of industrial action over pay and concerns about patient safety being compromised by staff shortages.Royal College of Nursing general secretary and chief executive Pat Cullen met Steve Barclay on Monday in the hope of beginning formal pay negotiations but the health secretary refused to discuss pay.The nurses’ union says it has repeatedly offered to negotiate either directly or via the independent ACAS dispute resolution service but the government has declined all its offers.Pat Cullen said: “Nurses are not relishing this, we are acting with a very heavy heart.“My plea to patients is to know that this strike is for you too – it’s about waiting lists, treatments that are cancelled year-round and the very future of the NHS.”25,000 nursing staff have left the profession in the past year. There are now 47,000 unfilled registered nursing posts in NHS England alone – a third of 133,000 vacancies across the service.UCAS figures show that the number of students accepted onto UK nursing courses has fallen by 10% and London School of Economics research has confirmed that experienced nurses are 20% worse off in real terms than they were in 2010 because of successive below-inflation pay awards.Striking nurses at the corner of Barrack Road and Dryden RoadKatie Welsh, a learning disability nurse who has worked in the NHS for 37 years, said: “What concerns me is actually getting people to come into our profession. It’s a great profession, but unfortunately things have changed. I was paid to do my training. You weren’t coming out with huge amounts of debt.”“You’ve got community nurses in Devon who are choosing between putting fuel in their cars to get to work and visit patients and putting food on the table. That can’t be right.”She expressed concern about both recently-qualified and long-serving nurses leaving the profession.She said that her daughter, who is also a nurse, was questioning whether she could carry on, while there are nurses who might have been willing to stay on to work beyond their retirement age but are now saying they’d had enough.Sarah Newborough, a mental health nurse who has worked for the NHS for eight years, said: “People become disillusioned. I got to my third year of training and thought I’m not sure I’m able to enter a system in which working conditions are deteriorating, patient contact time decreasing, with pressure on nurses to do more with less.“Certainly since 2015 when I started working in Devon the situation has become more fraught. Most nurses are struggling to get by. People who have been in the workforce for much longer than me have seen their workload increase and take home pay become worth less.“It’s terrible that many of the student nurses that are coming through are conscientious, compassionate and committed to working alongside others to support their health and wellbeing, but are entering a system that is exploiting them.“Being a nurse isn’t something you do, it’s something you are. We need to protect what it means to be a nurse.”Striking nurses at the Devon Partnership NHS Trust headquarters in Dryden RoadStrikes are taking place today and on Tuesday at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Wonford and North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple.These hospitals are now part of the Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, after the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust and Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust merged in April this year to deliver core health services for 615,000 people across north, east and mid-Devon and specialist services across the south west peninsula.Strikes are also taking place at the Devon Partnership NHS Trust, which is headquartered in Dryden Road and delivers mental health services across dozens of locations in the south west, and at NHS Devon Integrated Care Board, which is based at County Hall.Nurses at Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust, which operates six hospitals in the Torbay area, are also out on strike.Some nursing staff at these trusts are continuing to work to ensure that life-preserving services are provided. Royal College of Nursing members working in chemotherapy, dialysis, intensive and high dependency care units, neonatal and paediatric emergency services have all been exempted from taking part in strike action.Other non-critical services may be reduced to staffing levels similar to night shifts.The Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said it is seeking to minimise disruption on strike days and ensure patient safety and staff welfare. It is asking patients with appointments at its hospitals to attend unless they hear otherwise. Emergency services remain accessible 24 hours a day.Striking nurses at the Royal Devon and Exeter HospitalMore than 10,000 ambulance workers across nine trusts in England and Wales, including those at the South Western Ambulance Service, are also planning to strike on 21 and 28 December, while strikes by thousands of rail and postal workers are set to continue as the government refuses to shift its position on pay.It has asked armed forces personnel and police officers to drive ambulances and provide logistical support to cover for striking NHS workers, prompting pushback from the Police Federation and senior army figures.The TUC published analysis on Monday showing that 2022 has been the UK’s worst year for real wage growth since 1977 – and the second worst year since 1945 – as pay has failed to keep pace with inflation.It says nurses’ real pay has fallen by an average of £1,800 over the past year and that they are now earning £5,000 a year less in real terms than they were in a decade ago."

"content" : "Water services regulator Ofwat has extensively criticised South West Water in its annual report on the performance of water and wastewater companies in England and Wales.The regulator said South West Water remained among the worst performing companies in the sector as it continues its enforcement case against the company for potential failures at sewage treatment works that may have led to sewage discharges into the environment.The company fell further behind its targets during 2021-22, the period covered by the report, after its performance worsened compared with the previous year. It failed to deliver its commitments across five measures including pollution incidents, treatment works compliance and water quality.The regulator highlighted South West Water’s “sustained poor performance over a number of years” across all pollution incident categories, saying the company was also “significantly below target on the number of serious pollution incidents”.It added that it urgently needs to improve its performance in this area.The company also reported the lowest treatment works compliance levels and the highest wastewater allowance underspend in the sector as it fell behind on service improvements that it was funded to deliver. It also spent less than half its infrastructure enhancement allowance.David Black, Ofwat CEO, said the lack of investment was “extremely disappointing, especially in light of the poor performance for customers and the environment”.South West Water was also the only company not to achieve a decrease in per capita water consumption.The Environment Agency’s 2021 water company performance assessment, which the regulator incorporated in its report, placed South West Water at the bottom of its league table beside Southern Water and said the two companies’ performance was “terrible across the board”.It criticized South West Water for continuing to perform “significantly below target” on most measures, and highlighted that the company had been responsible for persistently high numbers of pollution incidents during all eleven years since the agency’s annual water company environmental performance assessments had begun.The number of serious South West Water pollution incidents in 2021 nearly tripled compared with the previous year.In the decade to 2020, South West Water paid £1.1 billion in dividends, while averaging £163 million per annum in pre-tax profits.Its parent company, Pennon Group, ended 2020-21 with a £3 billion cash surplus then paid out nearly £2 billion to shareholders.Following South West Water’s poor performance last year the regulator decided that the company would have to return just £13.3 million to its customers – less than £7.39 per person."

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s auditor has identified significant weaknesses in Exeter City Living governance arrangements that could lead to “significant loss or exposure to significant financial risk” for the council in relation to loans it approved to the company.By the end of March last year the council had approved loans to the company totalling £24.6 million despite the company accumulating losses of £2.2 million in its first two years of trading.The auditor’s report, which concerns the 2020-21 financial year, identifies governance weaknesses including the absence of a 2021-22 business plan for the council-owned and funded company, the council’s failure to require company performance reports, and conflicts of interest created by council directors with statutory legal and financial responsibilities holding company board roles.The report is also critical of the council’s practice of taking all decisions related to the company in private and withholding company business plans and reports from the public.Exeter City Council 2020-21 external audit report key recommendationThe auditor issued a “key recommendation”, as required by the National Audit Office, setting out actions that the council should take where significant weaknesses in its financial arrangements have been identified, as well as nine related improvement recommendations.A formal review of the council’s progress on making the required changes will take place next year, following an external review of the company’s governance arrangements that the council has now commissioned.Two senior council directors have already resigned from the company’s board as well as the board of Exeter City Group, Exeter City Living’s parent company.At a council meeting last week the auditor said that such recommendations were not issued lightly, adding that there was significant scope for the council to improve transparency in relation to the company, around its financial affairs in particular, so it could be held to account more effectively.Exeter City Council 2020-21 external audit report key recommendation (continued)When Exeter City Living was created in July 2018 the late Pete Edwards, then council leader, confirmed that the council would make Exeter City Living business plans and reports publicly available with only limited, legally-compliant exceptions to cover commercially sensitive financial information.However by the following year the council was routinely excluding the public from meetings which discuss Exeter City Living and withholding related information and documents.Exeter Observer responded by systematically challenging the council’s Exeter City Living transparency failures using local government transparency and public information access rights.We sought the release of company business plans and reports via freedom of information legislation, submitted formal objections to the council’s practice of making decisions about the company in private and exercised public accounts inspection rights to scrutinise the company’s financial affairs.The council has persistently sought to evade scrutiny despite its statutory obligations, routinely taking months to reply to information requests then supplying extensively redacted documents without proper justification for non-disclosure.It has repeatedly disputed the legislative basis for transparency in relation to private meetings and simply failed to respond to questions about the lawfulness of company operations.The auditor’s recent report makes clear that its approach needs to change.Exeter City Living 2020-21 business plan redactionsWhen Exeter Observer examined all the council’s significant decisions regarding Exeter City Living earlier this year we found that most appeared to breach local government regulations intended to protect the public interest in the use of public land and money.We also found decisions that were made without any scrutiny at all, including the decision not to produce a company 2021-22 business plan that was criticised in the auditor’s report.This was taken in private by the council’s chief executive, Karime Hassan, in consultation with Dave Hodgson, the council’s financial director and section 151 officer – then also an Exeter City Living (and Exeter City Group) company director – and council leader Phil Bialyk.It led directly to the situation criticised in the auditor’s report: not only were company financing and delivery assumptions not updated to reflect changing market conditions, including the impact of the pandemic, the council did not receive any progress reports in relation to the outdated business plan so was “not able to hold the company directors formally to account”.Exeter City Living 2022-23 business plan redactionsKarime Hassan also took the decisions that Exeter City Group would not pursue subsidiary consultancy or retrofit companies in private in April last year.The council said the powers delegated to the company’s Shareholder Representative (a role he held from September 2020) were sufficient to have taken these decisions, but there does not appear to be any reference to such powers in the company management agreement delegation scheme.When council officers asked us to raise our concerns about the council’s potential exposure to financial risk in writing, in detail, more than twelve months ago, we were told that the council’s monitoring officer, Baan Al-Khafaji, would investigate. We never received a reply.However earlier this year she attended an executive meeting to advise it on its response to our objections to the council taking decisions about Exeter City Living in private.She was also then a director of Exeter City Living (and Exeter City Group) and so legally required to act in the interests of the company despite her statutory role at the council, exactly the conflict of interest criticised in the auditor’s report.Exeter City Living Vaughan Road development siteThe council has so far allocated nearly £1 million to Exeter City Living for start up and planning costs, approved loans of nearly £25 million for development delivery, gifted it more than £2 million in land purchase discounts and commissioned or purchased just over £20 million of housing.The company has also been granted more than £7 million of central government financial support, yet it has completed just 22 housing units in the four and a half years since it was created.It has delivered so little that it is reduced to claiming credit for St. Sidwell’s Point leisure centre on its website alongside the marketing for its Clifton Hill and Vaughan Road developments, both of which have stalled.Clifton Hill sports centre closed nearly five years ago but redevelopment hasn’t got past demolition, paid for by the government, with no prospect of further work until 2023-24 or beyond. Vaughan Road is in a similar state, with the site becoming a focus for anti-social behaviour.The council nevertheless intends to appoint the company to redevelop Mary Arches multi-storey car park, making early use of another government demolition grant despite its delivery record.Exeter City Council Mary Arches Street multi-storey car parkThe auditor’s recent report only addresses the company’s activities to the end of March 2021. Important questions remain unanswered about what has happened since.In June 2021 the council successfully applied for government funding to support development of a total of 461 dwellings on five Exeter City Living sites. Detailed viability assessments were included in its application which specified that three-quarters would be for market rent or sale despite the public procurement rules exemption eligibility requirement that no more than 20% of the company’s activity can be in the private sector.This exemption is the basis on which the council decided, the following month, to commission the company to relocate its works facility at Belle Isle depot, with a budget of £3.5 million, without competitive tendering.It is also the basis on which it decided, in September last year, to sell the depot to the company for redevelopment for £2.2 million. The council has also received £675,000 from the government to redevelop this site: its funding bid said 70% of the proposed housing units would be constructed for sale on the open market.The company’s recent consultation on its plans for the site, which the council did not publicise, said nothing about this use of public land and money to provide so much private housing.

Subscribe freeExeter City Living’s financing and activities are of essential public interest both because residents and businesses are entitled to know what the council is doing with these resources and because the company could expose the council to significant risk, as the auditor has now confirmed.In a recent review of major financial problems at councils in Croydon, Northampton and Nottingham, Exeter City Council’s auditor highlighted the risk of optimism bias in local authority management of public money and criticised council pursuit of political objectives without effective scrutiny.It said these can lead to failures to understand the risks of embarking on complex, major projects without appropriate due diligence, and emphasised the value of decision-making scrutiny.The auditor is due to report on the council’s performance during the 2021-22 financial year in January. Not only does this period cover unanswered questions about Exeter City Living, it brings significant issues around council governance arrangements and decision-making in relation to Exeter City Futures and Exeter Development Fund into focus too."

"content" : "Analysis of Higher Education Statistics Agency figures has shown that the University of Exeter is lagging behind its sector peers on salaries for female academics and the use of insecure contracts to employ academic staff.Last year the university employed more than twice as many men than women in the highest full-time academic pay band and nearly one and a half times more in the second highest band.Taken together, the university pays 46% of its full-time female academic staff in these higher rate bands compared with 53% across the 140 members of Universities UK.It is in 57th place for the proportion paid in the highest rate band and 113th place for the second highest rate band despite being among the largest employers in the sector.Fourteen of the fifteen Universities UK members with the highest proportions of full-time female academic staff in the highest pay band are located in London, including Birkbeck College, Goldsmith’s College and King’s College.Full-time female academic staff salary distribution at the University of Exeter has only changed incrementally over the past five years, during which time its full-time academic staff payroll has grown by nearly a third.Most of the change that has taken place has occurred since sector staff began industrial action in response to cuts to the universities pension scheme in 2018.A parallel dispute began the following year over pay equality and employment conditions, when Exeter university staff took part in a national eight day strike.Another Exeter strike followed in early 2020 and the dispute continued with the largest walkout in the sector’s history this week and last.The University of Exeter also compares poorly with its Universities UK peers on its use of insecure academic staff employment contracts.It employs 55% of its academic staff on insecure contracts compared with 47% across Universities UK’s 140 members.It is in 109th place for the proportion of its academic staff it employs on permanent or open-ended contracts and among the highest users of fixed-term contracts in the sector.It has only made changes to its practices in this area over the past two years, since Exeter staff began to take strike action alongside their sector colleagues.Between 2017 and 2019 the proportion of academic staff it employed on insecure contracts remained unchanged at nearly two thirds.In 2019-20 this fell by 2% and last year another 7%, but at 55% of the academic workforce this proportion remains among the highest in the sector.The ten Universities UK members with the lowest proportion of staff employed on insecure contracts, among which several also have large academic payrolls, employ fewer than 11% of their academic staff this way.The Exeter branch of the University &amp;amp; College Union (UCU), which represents higher education workers across the country, says that between August and December last year the University of Exeter issued around 600 casual employment contracts against just 200 that were permanent or open-ended.It also says that academics who have worked at the university for more than four years on fixed-term contracts may now be granted contracts which are presented as open-ended but which may still depend on time-limited external funding, meaning they remain temporary and therefore insecure."

"content" : "The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is to investigate the University of Exeter’s refusal to disclose student accommodation numbers under freedom of information legislation.Its investigation follows the university’s failure to comply with a deadline it was given to review its handling of an Exeter Observer information request to provide the numbers of Exeter campus-based students housed in Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) during the 2021-22 academic year.The university had already admitted, in response to a related freedom of information request, that there were nearly 39,000 students based at its Exeter campuses that year – 11,500 more than the 27,300 FTE students it claims on its website.(FTE student numbers combine full-time and part-time students into a single total used for planning educational provision, not accommodation, although the university does not explain this anywhere on its “facts and figures” page.)The university can choose what to publish on its website, but its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 are legally binding. It is a criminal offence to alter or conceal information held by public authorities (including the university) with the intention of preventing disclosure following a request for the information under the Act.Exeter PBSA bedspace availability and occupancy rates make it likely that fewer than 10,000 of the university’s Exeter-based students stayed in this form of accommodation during the 2021-22 academic year, meaning around another 29,000 students would have been living in the city’s residential housing stock in one form or another.Academic research on the impact of increasing student numbers in Exeter and government housing stock and tenure distribution figures suggest that these students occupied around three quarters of the city’s stock of private rented properties – 8,250 dwellings which could otherwise have been used for residential housing by local people.The government does not hold precise figures for tenure distribution at local authority level and there are likely to be small PBSA occupancy rate variations. Meanwhile the city council continues to use council tax records to estimate student residential housing stock occupation despite the Office for National Statistics (ONS) concluding last year that they cannot be relied on for this purpose.So we asked the university to provide its own figures for the distribution of Exeter campus-based students across both university- and privately-provided PBSA in 2021-22 so we could, in turn, confirm exactly how many were living in the city’s private residential housing stock.Exeter PBSA map. Source: University of Exeter.The university’s response was to claim it does not know and cannot find out because it “does not hold structured or consistent data to answer the question without manual process to review all student records”.It nevertheless also said: “Records are kept as standard address: house number, street name, postcode” but claimed this information could not be used to identify which of its students lived in either its own or privately-provided PBSA despite it also knowing the location and ownership of all 66 such blocks in the city, information it publishes on its website.When we pointed out that its standardised student address format would enable it to make simple database queries to match the postcodes of each PBSA address against the postcodes of each student address record, yielding the information we had requested, it claimed that it was not obliged to provide the information as it would have to perform this cross-referencing by hand.University regulations and policies which relate to the electronic online Student Record System that it uses to manage address information for all its Exeter students say otherwise.Its data protection notice says that it holds and processes permanent and term-time addresses of all its students and its general regulations say all Exeter-based students are required to maintain up to date home and term-time address records via its electronic online Student Record System as a condition of enrolment, a requirement repeated on its academic study administration portal.It even provides a student records data request service that enables staff to access these records.

Subscribe freeWhen we asked the university to review of its handling of our information request, as per the rights conferred by the Freedom of Information Act, it initially resisted, repeating its previous claim about manual processing.Then, when we pointed out that its response did not address any of the issues we raised regarding its failure to comply with the provisions of the Act, and asked it to confirm that it had provided its full and final response before we complained to the ICO, it suddenly changed its tune and said it would perform a proper review.Such reviews should normally be completed within twenty working days. After 22 working days we followed up and were told that a review was underway and would be completed in no more than 40 working days, the maximum allowed by law.When 43 working days passed without the university completing the review (62 since we submitted the initial request) we wrote to the ICO, which gave the university a ten day response deadline.The university remained silent, the deadline passed and the ICO has now confirmed it will launch an investigation into the university’s refusal to provide the information."

"content" : "EXETER CITY COUNCIL is expected to impose a 7% rent and service charge increase on council housing tenants – the maximum allowed – at a meeting on 10 January.EXETER CITY COUNCIL will have to make net savings of £3.835 million next financial year and reduce its reserves to a minimum despite an increase in central government funding according to 2023-24 budget proposals to be discussed at the same meeting. Repairs and maintenance of council-owned property will be cut back significantly, resulting in further degradation and closure risks, but a £10.6 million loan to Exeter City Living will go ahead.A progress report on the development of the 2023-24 EXETER CITY LIVING business plan confirms a governance and management review will be taking place following an auditor’s report which found that it had put the council at “significant financial risk” after losing £2.2 million in its first two years of trading. The report also confirms that the business plan won’t be ready until a fortnight after the financial year to which it applies begins – five months late – and that a contractor still hasn’t been appointed for the company’s Vaughan Road development.EXETER CITY COUNCIL has been allocated a £1.3 million share over two years of a £654 million government homelessness prevention grant.The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is consulting on proposals to update the NATIONAL PLANNING POLICY FRAMEWORK via the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill. Relaxation of central government-imposed housing targets and changes to the requirement to demonstrate a five year housing land supply are both included, with major implications for the new Exeter Local Plan.KARIME HASSAN’s tenure as city council CEO is to be terminated following a decision taken in private by councillors, with Bindu Arjoon to be appointed as interim CEO in his place.EXETER CITY COUNCIL is consulting on a partial review of the charges it levies on developers to pay for community grants, habitat impact mitigation and projects like Marsh Barton railway station. Its decision to launch a public consultation during the holiday period follows an attempt by opposition councillors to prevent the proposals going ahead in their current form. Anyone wishing to speak at the subsequent public examination hearing must notify the council in writing before the end of consultation period on 25 January.EXETER COLLEGE has submitted revised Flowerpot Playing Fields redevelopment plans following widespread objections to proposals to erect a three metre fence around publicly-accessible playing fields and replace them with artificial turf.A peer-reviewed academic study has found that plane flights taken by the wealthiest people in the UK use more energy than all aspects of the lives of the poorest put together. The findings follow news that EXETER AIRPORT flight volumes all-but returned to pre-pandemic levels this summer.Proposals to convert empty ground floor retail units to additional student accommodation units in the CENTRAL LIVING STUDENT ACCOMMODATION BLOCK that replaced the Honiton Inn at the foot of Paris Street have been submitted to Exeter City Council for approval. Permission was granted for the conversion of five ground floor commercial units to nineteen student rooms at The Depot in Cheeke Street last year.An application to convert EXELAND HOUSE in Tudor Street to a 38-unit co-living block has been submitted for approval by Exeter City Council.The OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS has published new local authority-level travel to work data derived from the 2021 census.The UNIVERSITY OF EXETER is promoting its sixth place ranking in the 2023-23 People and Planet university league table, citing its “efforts to lead meaningful action against the climate emergency and ecological crisis” after signing a £16 million five-year sponsorship deal with Shell which it did not publicly announce despite being in business with the company since 2005."

"content" : "Following a public inquiry into poor levels of service provision by Stagecoach South West, the West of England Traffic Commissioner has imposed a penalty valued by the company at just £120,000.It is to be delivered in the form of four days’ free travel within the Exeter Plus ticket zone on the weekends of 10-11 and 17-18 December.The commissioner also accepted an offer from the company to employ a new member of staff to maintain information displays and provide assistance at Exeter bus station, which Stagecoach said would cost £70,000 per year for two years.He recorded this offer as a “statement of intent” from which the company could apply to be released “in due course if the circumstances support it.”Exeter ticket zone mapDevon County Council’s response to the commissioner’s decision was bland and predictable.Conservative county councillor Andrea Davis, who co-ordinated the public complaints about the bus company and holds the transport brief at County Hall, said:“We welcome the traffic commissioner’s decision and are grateful that they have listened to our concerns and those of Devon residents.“We look forward to seeing an improved service offered by Stagecoach.”Stagecoach South West said: “We deeply regret the level of service experienced by some of our passengers in recent months and we fully accept the decision of the Traffic Commissioner.“Moving forward, our priority is to build on the extensive steps we have been taking to drive up the reliability of our services for our local communities.“We are committed to working with our local authority partners to ensure these improvements continue and are sustained.”Campaign sticker on Exeter bus shelter during 2021 Stagecoach strike over pay and working conditionsOther reactions have been less benign. Barry West, RMT south west regional organiser, criticised the company’s employment contracts for new staff as “a backwards and retrograde step [that] will do nothing for staff retention”.He also said that reductions in sick pay and annual holiday entitlements in the new contracts were paying for the £2,000 “welcome bonus” Stagecoach offers to new drivers who already hold Passenger Carrying Vehicle (PCV) licences.Nor have bus passengers been persuaded that Stagecoach has been adequately punished for the service failings it has inflicted on them in recent years.One member of the Exeter Area Bus Action Group said: “How is this going to make them improve the service? I would rather pay and have a bus that turns up when it is meant to thanks!”Another said: “What about the people that buy weekly and monthly tickets? We aren’t gaining anything.”Stagecoach buses in Exeter High StreetLabour county councillor Marina Asvachin also said she was disappointed with the commissioner’s decision at an authority scrutiny meeting last week, describing the free weekend travel penalty as “atrocious”.The decision may also penalise other operators who serve similar routes to Stagecoach on the two December weekends.Since the end of October the Stagecoach service 5 route between Crediton and Exeter has also been served by Go-Devon services 315, 345 and 377.Similarly, Okehampton to Exeter weekend service 6A is operated by Stagecoach on Saturdays and by Go-Cornwall on Sundays, while Dartline Saturday service 173 follows a similar route between Tedburn St Mary and Exeter.Why pay to travel with Go-Devon, Go-Cornwall or Dartline when you can travel free with Stagecoach?Stagecoach app showing Exeter bus service delays and cancellationsIt is not clear why the traffic commissioner softened his stance after clearly signalling at the public inquiry hearing that the company’s offer of free travel was welcome but not enough.Despite making clear that the starting point for a financial penalty in this case was between £170,800 and £234,850 he said that the company’s offer of free travel and an additional Exeter bus station staff member would “exceed the level of financial penalty I find to be appropriate”.The commissioner nevertheless found grounds for severe criticism of the company. He said: “This is largely not a case of buses running more than one minute early or five minutes late. It is a case of buses not running at all.”He also said: “It has taken until this summer for a really significant [pay] increase to be implemented. I accept that external funding has made budgeting difficult but progress has been unacceptably slow.”He added that the company’s January 2022 claim that full staffing levels in Torbay and Plymouth would cover shortfalls in Barnstaple and Exeter “clearly proved not to be the case” leading to the withdrawal of more services, several at short notice.He said: “The complaints provided by Devon County Council tell of workers being disciplined by their employers for being late for work, rent money being spent on taxis to work and important appointments being missed.“There are complaints from parents and teachers about children not being able to get to school or waiting up to two hours for a bus to arrive.“Some passengers with medical conditions complain of not being able to travel at all as they cannot trust a bus to arrive and cannot stand for long periods. A lack of information, even on the app, is cited by many.”It is reasonable to assume that some negotiation took place. Did Stagecoach suggest that too costly a penalty would prompt it to cut commercial services – those run at the company’s discretion and not financed by the county council – to pay for the fine?Stagecoach has changed its timetables three times this year - in April, July and now OctoberAt the hearing Stagecoach said its driver shortage had been reduced to manageable levels and placed significant emphasis on the prospective benefits of its October timetable changes.The commissioner’s report painted an optimistic picture, following several pay increases which he said “settled matters in Exeter”.The experience of bus users during November suggests that matters are far from settled.While the number of cancellations appears to have fallen, punctuality is still poor, short-notice cancellations still occur and real-time information provision is still erratic and misleading.There is anecdotal evidence that drivers are still leaving the company, and the additional Exeter bus station staff member will be of no benefit to the many passengers who use local buses which do not stop at the station.Stagecoach failed to respond to a request for comment on these observations.

Meanwhile Devon County Council is counting on the success of the new DevonBus Enhanced Partnership, which it describes as “an agreement between a local authority and local bus operators to work together to improve local bus services”.Establishing this partnership is a prerequisite for further government funding under the Devon Bus Service Improvement Plan.It will be managed by a board comprised of county council, bus operator and user representatives. Board meetings are to be held in private earlier, although minutes will be published after the fact.A forum to channel the views of bus user groups to the board is also being established. Its membership will be drawn from established local user groups and its chair will be appointed to the board.Its meetings will also be held behind closed doors despite the widespread public interest in these matters."

"content" : "University of Exeter staff are taking strike action alongside more than 70,000 lecturers and other academic and support staff at 150 UK universities.The University and College Union (UCU), which represents higher education workers across the country, says the strike action is the largest in the sector’s history.Union members voted for industrial action in two national ballots after ongoing disputes over pay, working conditions and pensions failed to produce agreement with employers.Large majorities of over 80% in both ballots voted in favour of full strikes and taking action short of a full strike.This includes working strictly to employment contract terms and not undertaking any unpaid work or other activities for employers, a practice which has become commonplace in the sector.This action began on Wednesday and will continue until further notice, while three days of full strikes began yesterday and continue today and next Wednesday.Streatham campus picket line. Photo: Sabina Leonelli.The union’s general secretary Jo Grady said: “70,000 university staff have turned out like never before, defying bullying tactics from management to show they will no longer accept falling pay, pension cuts, brutal workloads and gig-economy working conditions.“If vice-chancellors doubted the determination of university staff to save our sector then today has been a rude awakening for them.”She added: “We have been overwhelmed by the support of thousands of students who have joined us on the picket lines. They recognise that vice-chancellors are wrecking the sector for staff and students alike and are determined to stand with us and fix it.”The National Union of Students said: “Staff teaching conditions are students’ learning conditions. The struggles we face as students are inextricably linked to the reasons that staff are striking.“High rents, astronomical international student fees and cuts to maintenance support have happened for the same reasons that staff are suffering under huge workloads: the failed marketisation of the sector which has put profit above staff and student well-being.”Geography PhD researchers on strike. Photo: Saffron O’Neill.The UCU is seeking a fair pay deal that acknowledges the cost of living crisis after staff were offered 3% increases this year.This is less than a third of the UK inflation rate and follows increases that the union says have seen staff pay fall by a quarter since 2009.It also wants to agree a framework to eliminate insecure employment conditions and excessive workloads as well as gender, ethnic and disability pay disparities.It says a third of academic staff are on some form of temporary contract, with staff working an average of two days additional unpaid work each week.Streatham campus breakfast picket. Photo: UCU South West.Staff pensions are also at the centre of the dispute. The UCU says cuts imposed this year by sector employer Universities UK will mean members of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) will lose an average of 35% of their future retirement income.Those at the beginning of their careers face losses of hundreds of thousands of pounds.A recent USS report showed that were the cuts fully restored the scheme would still be left with a £600 million surplus.The UCU also says that actuaries advising the University of Cambridge estimate that the restored benefits would require lower scheme contributions than the amounts currently paid by members.The UCU is seeking a full reversal of the cuts and revaluation of the scheme.St Luke’s campus picket line. Photo: Exeter UCU.The dispute between higher education workers and their employers over pay, pensions and working conditions has been going on since 2018, with University of Exeter staff taking part in major strikes in 2019 and 2020.The UCU says the UK university sector generated record income of £41.1 billion last year with vice chancellors collectively earning £45 million.Steve Smith, then the University of Exeter’s vice chancellor, received the largest ever pay package in the sector in 2020.His successor Lisa Roberts received £347,000 the following year of which £53,000 was pension contributions paid by the university on her behalf."

"content" : "Devon County Council allocated 87% of its total transport infrastructure expenditure to motor vehicle infrastructure in 2021-22 while only 3% went to walking and 4% to cycling.Figures acquired from the county council under local authority accounts inspection legislation show road spending dominating both its capital and revenue spending across new and existing infrastructure.New walking infrastructure constituted only 1% of total capital transport infrastructure expenditure allocations in 2021-22, and new cycling infrastructure less than 2.5% of the total.Combined, less than £3.5 million of county council capital transport expenditure was allocated to new active travel infrastructure, with slightly less than the same amount again to its maintenance.The largest single project in Exeter among these allocations is the £230,000 pedestrian and cycle bridge due to be built across the A379 to facilitate the controversial South West Exeter extension.Motor vehicle infrastructure, in contrast, received nearly three quarters of county council new transport infrastructure capital expenditure allocations and more than 94% of transport maintenance expenditure.Roads received nearly £87 million of a total of just over £100 million allocated to capital infrastructure spending, with Marsh Barton railway station receiving another £7 million.The county council allocated more money  to resurfacing a section of the A380 than it did to maintaining all the county’s walking and cycling infrastructure combined.County council revenue spending on new transport infrastructure, which is much lower than capital expenditure on new transport infrastructure, was £650,000 for the same year.£263,000 (40%) of this was spent on motor vehicle infrastructure, another £89,000 on e-bikes and charging points and £78,000 on the Queen Street footway widening that the county council now plans to remove.Although this is primarily a pedestrian scheme, the county council allocated it to cycling infrastructure spending in its accounts. It did the same with the long-overdue Exeter Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan on which £34,000 was spent in 2021-22.Devon County Council doesn’t normally distinguish between expenditure on walking, cycling, rail and motor vehicle infrastructure in its transport finance records, restricting cost/benefit analysis of active travel interventions to ad hoc piecemeal calculations.While it was able to break down its capital expenditure allocations for transport infrastructure into different travel modes when questioned under accounts inspection legislation, it was unable to do the same for its £24 million 2021-22 revenue spending on transport infrastructure maintenance.Active Travel England guidance says that, unless more detailed information is held, local transport authorities should “assume 9% of highways maintenance is for cycling and walking which is the average percentage assumed by the department”.Doing so would mean that just over £2 million of this money went to active travel infrastructure maintenance while nearly £22 million went on motor vehicle infrastructure.Combining these capital and revenue expenditure figures shows that, overall, the county council allocated just over £4 million of its total 2021-22 transport infrastructure expenditure to walking, just over £5 million to cycling and nearly £109 million to motor vehicles – 87% of the total.There is little sign of the county council changing course on transport infrastructure spending in the coming years. Its transport capital programme for 2022-24 continues to allocate most of its capital expenditure on new transport infrastructure to roads.Its proposals show £122 million going to road schemes, £12 million to public transport and just £7 million to active travel. The schemes are slightly overprogrammed to allow for delivery timetable slippage: the county council intends to spend around £140 million in total during this period.It says that its transport capital programme supports “transport’s contribution towards addressing the climate emergency, with a range of sustainable transport schemes included” and that active travel or public transport schemes “represent 50% of the LTP ITB allocation for 2022-23”.However the Integrated Transport Block settlement the county council will receive towards delivery of its Local Transport Plan is worth just £3.628 million this year.The rest of the money, of which nowhere near half will be spent on active travel or public transport schemes, comes from a wide range of other sources.The county council also says that its transport capital programme “seeks to prioritise active and sustainable travel investment across the county, whilst also supporting economic growth through the delivery of major schemes”.It gives its oxymoronic programme the maximum possible scores on actions such as encouraging “sustainable lifestyles” as part of its response to the climate emergency and giving “people greater opportunities for walking and cycling to increase their physical activity” as a health and wellbeing improvement strategy.It is not clear how the programme’s road schemes, which it describes as “multi-modal/highway improvements” and which comprise 86% of its planned capital expenditure, deliver the active or sustainable travel benefits the county council claims.Of the £204.3 million transport capital funding it identifies as “successfully secured and currently in use”, which includes £60 million for the A361 North Devon link road, £38 million for the A382 Drumbridges to Newton Abbot road and £25 million to be spent on roads at Cullompton, Tiverton and Dawlish, just £2.4 million is for new active travel schemes."

"content" : "A Reclaim the Night protest will take place on Thursday 1 December, when hundreds of people will again march through Exeter city centre to raise awareness of sexual violence and harassment experienced by women and girls in public space.The event, co-ordinated by Devon Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Services, local feminist groups and students from the University of Exeter, takes place during 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, an annual campaign co-ordinated by the Center for Women’s Global Leadership.Participants are invited to make placards and banners together from 4.30pm at St Sidwell’s Community Centre, where the protest will gather from 6pm to set off for Bedford Square at 6.30pm.Reclaim the Night protest in Exeter High Street. Photo: Merryn Wilson.An Exeter survey found in February this year that more than 85% of its 1,566 respondents felt unsafe or very unsafe when walking alone in the city centre at night. 98% identified as women and 71% were aged between 18 and 44.A quarter said they had been affected by a sexual offence and a third said they had experienced harassment in the last three years.When asked what they disliked about Exeter at night 70% said drunken behaviour, 60% said aggressive behaviour and almost half said they disliked the presence of gangs or groups.When questioned about the survey findings at a meeting in April the city council criticised the survey design and refuted its headline findings, claiming they were inaccurate as “Exeter was, generally, a very safe city”.Four days later a city councillor was sexually harassed and threatened with violence by a group of men outside a pub in a residential area of the city.Reclaim the Night protest in Bedford Street. Photo: Reclaim the Night Devon.In the twelve months to the end of September Devon and Cornwall Police recorded 919 violent and sexual offences in Exeter city centre alone, alongside 872 incidents of anti-social behaviour.These offences dominate the figures: well under half as many shoplifting offences were recorded in the city centre during this period, the next most frequently-occurring crime.During the same period the police recorded 4,328 violent and sexual offences across the city as a whole, more than 35% of all Exeter recorded crime.Office of National Statistics data separately identifies sexual offences at police force area level, excluding other forms of violence against the person.These figures show that 5,495 sexual offences were recorded across Devon and Cornwall as a whole in the twelve months to June 2022, an increase of 21% over the previous year.This increase is greater than the 19.5% rise across England and Wales, where nearly 197,000 sexual offences were recorded during the same period.The proportion of sexual offences recorded in Devon and Cornwall as a share of all recorded crime is nearly 50% higher than it is across England and Wales.Reclaim the Night protest in Princesshay. Photo: Reclaim the Night Devon.Although 84% of sexual offences are perpetrated against women and girls, only one in six female victims report their experiences to the police, often for fear of being disbelieved.A report published in March last year by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for UN Women found that more than 70% of UK women have been sexually harassed in a public space.This rose to 86% among women aged 18-24, only 3% of whom reported not having experienced any of the types of harassment identified in the report at all.Full-time students are more likely to experience sexual assault than people in any other occupational group.Protest placard-making at St Sidwell’s Community Centre. Photo: Reclaim the Night Devon.Reclaim the Night protests began in the UK in 1977, when torchlit events were held in Leeds, York, Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle, Brighton and London in response to the serial murders of women by Peter Sutcliffe.Police advice at the time was that women should keep themselves safe by not going out at night.Reclaim the Night subsequently grew across the rest of the country before gaining new momentum last year when the high-profile murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa prompted protests across the UK.32 year-old Lorraine Cox was brutally murdered in Exeter in 2020 after her killer followed her through the city’s streets. She had been out socialising with friends.Reclaim the Night protest at Guildhall shopping centre. Photo: Merryn Wilson.Mandy Barnes of Reclaim the Night Devon said: “Violence and harassment is still an ongoing concern for women in Exeter and Devon as well as across the globe.“It is a human right for us to be able to feel safe out on the streets where we live.”Caroline Voaden, CEO of Devon Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Services, added: “We know that many people have never been on a march before and may feel slightly unsure about joining in but we would encourage anyone who cares about women and children to come along.“The atmosphere will be light, you will be amongst people who feel the same as you and the walk is about visibility rather than confrontation.“Marshalls ensure this event is safe for everyone, including children”.

"content" : "The University of Exeter is holding a public consultation on its plans to demolish 30 buildings and construct 50,000m2 of new student accommodation on a fifteen acre Streatham campus site.The redevelopment of Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village on the north west corner of the campus between Cowley Bridge Road and Streatham Drive involves the demolition of twelve accommodation blocks, three other large buildings and a range of other structures.Eight new blocks will be constructed, with the development providing just under 50,000 square metres of internal floor space, around 90% of which will be student accommodation.The development, which the university recently rebranded as West Park, will be more than half as large again as the East Park development on the other side of the campus and more than ten times the size of the St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre.It was expected to produce a net increase of between 1,200 and 1,250 student bedspaces but the university recently said it intends the development to provide more than 1,700 new bedspaces.Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment demolition plan. Image: Willmore Iles.Exeter City Council granted outline planning permission for the development in July last year despite the plans meeting neither university nor council environmental standards policies.The Clydesdale and Nash Grove accommodation buildings, all of which are to be demolished, are only thirty years old. Apart from one three and one five page report which provided outline energy consumption estimates for some of the planned new buildings and summary descriptions of their design, no further assessment of the development’s carbon footprint was included with the application.The university nevertheless described the project as “an opportunity to develop an exemplar of environmentally sustainable buildings; moving well beyond statutory compliance to provide a new standard of low-carbon student accommodation”.

"content" : "Department for Transport statistics derived from the authoritative national travel and active lives surveys have revealed falling regular Exeter walking and cycling rates.While leisure walking rates have increased, decreases in walking for non-leisure purposes and falling cycling rates for all but the most occasional journeys mean an overall decline in regular active travel among Exeter residents has taken place.Regular cycling rates have fallen most of all. Between 2017 and last year the proportions of Exeter adults who cycled at least three times per week for leisure and non-leisure purposes each fell by more than two thirds.The proportion who cycled at least three times per week for any purpose fell 63%.Over the same period the proportion who cycled at least five times per week for non-leisure purposes, a travel pattern associated with cycling to and from the workplace, fell by 65%.The proportion cycling at least five times per week for leisure purposes fell by more than 90% to just 0.3%.Leisure walking rates in the city broadly increased during the five years to the end of 2021. But non-leisure walking rates fell at all surveyed frequencies over the same period.The proportion who walked at least five times per week for non-leisure purposes more than halved to 14%.When the survey figures are combined into overall walking and cycling rates for any purpose, the increase in leisure walking rates does not mask the overall decline in regular active travel rates among Exeter residents.The Department for Transport derives these figures from its National Travel Survey, which is the primary source of such data and is designed to inform policy development, and the Sport England Active Lives Survey, which gathers adult physical activity data.The surveys, which use weighted sampling techniques to make them more representative, both distinguish leisure travel, for the purpose of health, recreation, training or competition, from non-leisure travel undertaken to get from place to place.Journeys must take more than ten minutes to count as walking but all cycle journeys are included in the statistics, however brief.Related Department for Transport statistics show increases in the proportion of people in England who agree that it is too dangerous to cycle on the road.They show that while the proportion of cyclists who think cycling on the road is too dangerous has risen, it remains significantly lower than the proportion of non-cyclists who agree, suggesting that the key to increasing cycling rates is addressing safety concerns.This finding has been reinforced, particularly among women, in numerous studies performed over many years.Pedestrians on Queen StreetDespite the decline in walking and cycling rates among Exeter’s residents, Devon County Council intends to remove the active travel infrastructure it introduced in Queen Street in 2021 even though it says the scheme has increased road safety and cycling rates.It plans to reintroduce two-way motor vehicle traffic between Paul Street and Northernhay Street, reduce pedestrian capacity and remove the cycle lane altogether.Its justification is the cost it would incur if it followed through on the decision it took in January to make the current temporary arrangements permanent, but removing the existing infrastructure would cost more than leaving it in place.The contradictions don’t end there.When it consulted the public on the current Exeter Transport Strategy in 2020 the county council said that 70% “supported the rededication of highway space for pedestrians and cyclists in the city centre”.The recently-published Devon Carbon Plan, for which it is also responsible, says “there are significant benefits to reallocating road space to active travel”, a proposition which it says was “supported by 74% of the Devon Climate Assembly”.And the Devon Carbon Plan, despite hedging several transport policies with qualifiers such as “where possible” and “where appropriate”, unambiguously states that the county council will “reallocate road capacity to sustainable modes”.Pedestrians waiting to cross Paul StreetExeter City Council’s position on this principle is more equivocal. Both Exeter City Futures’ discredited Net Zero Exeter plan and the council’s outline draft local plan present their active travel proposals through the lens of the “reduced dominance of cars”.The county council’s Queen Street decision exposes the weakness of this frame as a policy aim.Because the reopened westbound carriageway will be restricted to buses and taxis – whether delivery lorries will also be allowed to go that way isn’t yet clear – the county can say that removing the cycle lanes, reducing the footway width and reintroducing two-way motor vehicle traffic is consistent with the city’s climate goals.Exeter Cycling Campaign’s response to the planned changes skewers the chicanery: “We cannot keep trumpeting our ‘50% active travel’ target whilst at the same time enabling an increase in car dominance.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            The active travel target, which is set at national level by the government’s transport decarbonisation plan, is for half of all journeys in towns and cities to be walked or cycled by 2050.According to the university’s analysis of Exeter’s transport emissions trajectory, this equates to “22% of journeys split evenly between cycling and walking, a target of 11% for each”.Achieving this by 2030, the city’s ostensible decarbonisation deadline, would require both walking and cycling levels to increase to more than nine times their current levels in the next seven years.UPDATE: This story previously included a photograph of a cyclist using the temporary Queen Street active travel infrastructure. A reader has since observed that this section of roadway is intended for walking, as per the county council decision to introduce it, not cycling.Accordingly, the original image was replaced with a photograph of pedestrians using the temporary Queen Street active travel infrastructure.Another reader subsequently pointed out that signs fixed to the boundary planters say “cyclists give way to pedestrians”, misleadingly indicating that pedestrians may be expected to share the infrastructure with cyclists despite its footway-widening purpose."

"content" : "Revised proposals for changes to parliamentary constituency boundaries have been published for a final consultation before they come into force in late 2023.Significant changes are being introduced across the UK with the intention of making Parliament more representative by reducing wide variations in voter numbers between seats.The changes will reduce the Exeter constituency’s size, moving its current eastern boundary westwards, meaning that many voters who are currently represented by a Labour MP will be moved to a new constituency with a footprint framed by the historically safe East Devon Conservative seat.At the moment all Exeter City Council’s local electoral wards form the parliamentary constituency except parts of Priory, St Loye’s and Topsham. These are divided by the current parliamentary boundary, although few people live in the section of Priory that is over the border, much of which consists of Ludwell Valley Park.Changes which were initially proposed would have involved moving the remainder of these three wards out of Exeter to repair the current ward split and reduce the Exeter constituency electorate of 80,676 to 71,713, firmly into the desired range.Voters in Wonford and St Loye’s and the areas round Burnthouse Lane, Thornpark Rise and Countess Wear would have been added to the 11,512 Exeter electors who already live in what is currently the East Devon constituency.The Ordnance Survey’s election maps site shows the current arrangements in detail.However these changes would have seen the Exeter parliamentary constituency lose the lion’s share of Priory ward, which the Labour Party dominates in local elections.In July last year Exeter City Council decided to put an alternative proposal to the boundary commission which relied on a simplification of voter numbers to propose keeping all of Priory in Exeter and jettisoning Pinhoe instead.Pinhoe’s history as a two-way Labour-Conservative marginal was not mentioned.The boundary commission took on the suggestion, held a second consultation with public hearings earlier this year, and has now published the revised constituency changes for a final consultation that runs until 5 December.The changes in East Devon will entail nearly 9,000 Exeter voters joining a new constituency called Exmouth and East Exeter.They will also involve the current East Devon constituency ceding a large chunk of territory on its eastern flank to a new Honiton and Sidmouth constituency.This will be comprised partly of the southern half of the current Tiverton and Honiton constituency that the Liberal Democrats won in a by-election in June following the resignation of Conservative Neil Parish.The new Honiton and Sidmouth constituency will also include Sidmouth, a key Conservative stronghold, and Ottery St Mary, the geographic centre of support for Independent Claire Wright’s prominent campaign to unseat previous East Devon incumbent Hugo Swire at the 2015 and 2017 general elections.Her 2019 general election campaign in the seat attracted national media attention when an MRP YouGov poll found she was the most likely Independent to be elected in Britain.How well current East Devon Conservative MP Simon Jupp might fare in the new Exmouth and East Exeter constituency remains to be seen, although it seems he will not face Claire Wright at the ballot box again following her decision to stand down from her county council seat last year.The Boundary Commission for England is due to publish its final report on the current review and submit its recommendations to parliament by July next year.More than 45,000 comments were submitted during the first and second stages of consultation on its proposals, nearly half of which have been changed as a result.The proposals which are currently out for the review’s final consultation would increase the number of constituencies in England from 533 to 543.Parallel reviews taking place in Scotland and Wales are set to decrease the number of constituencies from 59 to 57 and 40 to 32 respectively, with no changes in Northern Island leaving the UK with a total of 650 parliamentary constituencies, the same number it has now."

"content" : "According to information obtained from the university under freedom of information legislation there were 39,450 students based at its Exeter campuses during the 2012-22 academic year.The 38,800 students remaining after distance learners are excluded equated to just under 30% of the city’s 130,800 inhabitants.The university’s Exeter roll was 11,500 larger than the 27,300 FTE students its website says were based in Exeter during that year.(FTE student numbers combine full-time and part-time students into a single total used for planning educational provision, although the university does not explain this anywhere on its “facts and figures” page.)The university also confirmed that there were 33,150 full-time students based at its Exeter campuses in 2021-22 and another 5,300 mainly postgraduate part-time students. The remaining 350 students were registered for single terms or one semester only.The university did not explain the very large discrepancy between its published FTE figures and those it released under freedom of information legislation, which confirm that nearly 6,000 more full-time students were based on its Exeter campuses than the combined full- and part-time student numbers that its FTE figures purport to represent.While the university can choose what to publish on its website, its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 are legally binding. It is a criminal offence to alter or conceal information held by public authorities (including the university) with the intention of preventing disclosure following a request for the information under the Act.The university also provides its published FTE numbers to the city council to inform its planning policies related to student accommodation in the city despite these numbers being of little use for this purpose. Total student numbers are instead needed, but the university does not provide these.To estimate the extent to which Exeter’s residential housing stock is occupied by students the council instead relies on student council tax exemption records as part of a matrix of faulty premises, inaccurate information and miscalculated projections on which it has based its student accommodation policies for the past fifteen years.However the Office for National Statistics (ONS) concluded last year that council tax records cannot be relied on for this purpose after it found that only 12% of students live in addresses solely occupied by students and around 30% live in addresses that appear to be made up of students and non-students.It also found that only half of all student addresses have any indication on council tax that students live there.The council says it recorded 2,551 student council tax exemptions in the city’s residential housing stock in September this year (although it told the government the number of such exemptions was higher) and so concluded that 2,551 residential dwellings were occupied by students.The ONS research suggests that at least twice as many residential dwellings are being used this way (more than the 4,800 council homes in the city).The council’s student accommodation policies rely on the construction of Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) to mitigate the impact of university expansion on the city’s housing stock, with the aim that 75% of additional (not all) Exeter university students are housed this way.No evidence was provided as a basis for this policy when it was introduced fifteen years ago, none was provided when it was reformulated for the 2012 Exeter Core Strategy, currently the city’s principal planning policy document, and none has been provided since.The core strategy is based on a projection that there would be a little over 16,000 full-time students living away from home in Exeter by 2025-26. The 2010 Streatham campus masterplan is based on there being just 15,800 FTE students on the campus by the same year.Well over twice that many were based there by this time last year. The new Exeter Local Plan is about to scrap the student accommodation policies contained in the core strategy but its draft version, which is currently out for consultation, has nothing to say about these issues instead.Nearly 5,000 new PBSA bedspaces have been built in Exeter in the past four years. The university and private sector together provided just under 11,500 at the beginning of 2021-22.Had all 5,300 of Exeter’s part-time university students been living at home these PBSA blocks would still only have accommodated 35% of the full-time students the university says were based at Exeter campuses that year.There are now just under 12,500 Exeter PBSA bedspaces after completion of the second phase of the university’s East Park scheme and private developments at Mary Arches Street, Walnut Gardens and The Depot on Cheeke Street.Were the university’s 2022-23 cohort the same size as the previous year, the extra thousand rooms would still mean only 38% of its full-time Exeter students would live in PBSA during term-time.Both these calculations also assume that all the PBSA is full.Consultants commissioned by the council to review Exeter’s PBSA supply this time last year found that just 70% of the 5,100 rooms then available in private PBSA were occupied (the university provided another 6,400) in line with the previous two years.Exeter HMO map. Source: University of Exeter.With fewer than 10,000 Exeter PBSA bedspaces occupied during the 2021-22 academic year, the university’s remaining 28,900  Exeter-based students would all have been living in residential housing stock in one form or another.According to Professor Darren Smith of Loughborough University, who has twice been commissioned by the council to produce reports on the impact of increasing student numbers in Exeter, an average of 3.5 students share a typical student House in Multiple Occupation (HMO).This would mean Exeter students were living in nearly 8,250 HMOs that year which could otherwise have been used for residential housing by local people. That’s nearly three quarters of the city’s stock of around 11,000 private rented properties.However, combining unrepresentative council tax exemption figures, private PBSA uptake estimates and HMO occupancy rate averages are unlikely to produce an accurate account of the university’s impact on the city’s residential housing stock.Not sufficiently accurate, at any rate, to provide a basis on which to introduce the effective student accommodation policies the city needs.Which is why we also asked the university, under freedom of information legislation, to provide the true (not FTE) numbers of part-time and full-time undergraduate and postgraduate Exeter campus-based students housed both in university- and privately-provided PBSA during the 2021-22 academic year.Then we would actually know how many of its Exeter-based students were living in private residential housing stock.Exeter PBSA map. Source: University of Exeter.The university’s response was to claim it does not know and cannot find out because it “does not hold structured or consistent data to answer the question without manual process to review all student records”.It nevertheless also said: “Records are kept as standard address: house number, street name, postcode”.It said this information could not be used to identify which of its students lived in either its own or privately-provided PBSA despite it also knowing the location and ownership of all 66 such blocks in the city, details which it publishes on its website.When we pointed out that its standardised student address format would enable it to make simple database queries to match the postcodes of each PBSA address against the postcodes of each student address record, yielding the information we had requested, it claimed that it was not obliged to provide the information as it would have to perform this cross-referencing by hand.When we asked for a formal review of its handling of our information request, as per the rights conferred by the Freedom of Information Act, it initially resisted, repeating its previous claim about manual processing.Then, when we pointed out that its response did not address any of the issues we raised regarding its failure to comply with the provisions of the Act, and asked it to confirm that it had provided its full and final response before we complained to the Information Commissioner, it suddenly changed its tune and said it would perform a proper review.Such reviews should normally be completed within twenty working days. After 22 working days we followed up and were told that a review was underway and would be completed in no more than 40 working days, the maximum allowed by law.43 working days have now passed since we asked for a review (62 since we submitted the initial request) and we still haven’t received a response from the university.

It appears a caveat is required when it comes to its impact on Exeter’s residential housing stock."

"content" : "Stagecoach South West and Devon County Council took part in a public inquiry last Thursday at the Bristol headquarters of the West of England Traffic Commissioner.The inquiry was held to examine Stagecoach South West’s performance, particularly on its Exeter routes, after a specially-convened county council transport committee meeting expressed strong criticisms of its bus services in the city and surrounding area earlier this year.Substantial evidence of the company’s failings was submitted to the inquiry, including material contributed by councillors and aggrieved members of the public, although the county council stressed that it had not solicited this input and had requested the inquiry as a means of responding to public concern.Traffic commissioner Kevin Rooney concluded that “no action” was not an option at Thursday’s hearing, but delayed a final decision to allow the company to clarify its response.Stagecoach South West proposed compensation along the lines of a month’s free travel at weekends within Exeter and heavily discounted fares for travel into Exeter over the same period, but said it would need to examine costings before confirming the details.When prompted by the traffic commissioner to offer more, the company also said it would look at speeding up the introduction of planned improvements to real-time service information provision.It was given until close tomorrow to provide firm proposals so the commissioner can finalise his decision later this week.Devon County Council’s case was presented at the hearing by Damien Jones, head of its transport co-ordination service. He said that the evidence showed an unacceptable number of service cancellations exacerbated by insufficient service information provision.The real-time information systems were a source of particular frustration and the cause of serious problems for passengers. Sometimes information was missing from the company’s app and its 40 bus stop screens, at other times it was inaccurate.Information flow had not been helped by the centralisation of all Stagecoach operating enquiries into a single customer contact centre in Perth. Staff there had given out inaccurate information and had no understanding of the Exeter and Devon localities.Mr Jones noted that while the county council could impose sanctions on the company if it failed to deliver contracted services for which the county council provided financial support, no such remedy was available in the case of commercially-operated services.He said the county council’s working relationship with Stagecoach South West was good, though it had become strained of late, but added that it had low levels of confidence in the company’s ability to improve.It nevertheless welcomed the company’s assurances that a new timetable which started yesterday would change things for the better.He added that without improvement, the Enhanced Partnership being put in place as part of the Devon Bus Service Improvement Plan would be at risk, and failure to deliver the partnership would prevent the county council from accessing further government bus service support funding.  Bus service deregulation  Bus services were deregulated by the Transport Act 1985. Until then bus companies had been owned and operated by local councils or the public sector National Bus Company.  Local transport authorities such as Devon County Council controlled services and fare levels, which included specifying service frequency, setting and monitoring quality and safety standards and setting minimum standards and capacities for vehicles.  All this changed after deregulation. Apart from London, where services remain controlled by Transport for London, commercially operated bus companies bought the council-run and National Bus Company operators.  These private companies now determine which routes they want to run and the fares they charge. All that the law requires is that operators and drivers have a licence to operate and that vehicles comply with certain safety requirements.  Such regulation as remains falls to traffic commissioners to enforce. They have overall responsibility for operator licensing compliance and must be notified of changes to routes, including decisions to withdraw them.Stagecoach South West managing director Mike Watson said he accepted and regretted the extent of the problems experienced by passengers.He acknowledged that the company had got things wrong, such as assuming that it would be easy to recruit drivers during the pandemic despite the effects of Brexit and more attractive working conditions in the road haulage industry.Accordingly, Mr Watson said he had focused on attracting drivers to join (or re-join) the company by increasing pay and improving conditions, in particular by reducing evening and weekend work.He had replaced the senior management team he had inherited with people committed to creating a more supportive and inclusive employment environment. There were now more women in management positions, staff turnover was down and training capacity had increased.He said that this week’s timetable changes would take place with a manageable shortage of 45 of 900 drivers, and that the next set of timetable alterations in April 2023 would mark the start of a growth trajectory which would restore services to pre-pandemic levels.He also said these changes had been made without creating any formal trade union disputes.  Traffic commissioners  Traffic commissioners were first created in the 1930’s to supervise a new system of bus licensing developed by the government in response to concerns about safety and inconsistent service standards.  They have since undergone several changes of function and organisation, and are even now the subject of a government review. One constant feature has been that they are government appointees designed to work at arm’s length from both government and local authorities.  There are six geographically-based commissioners in England plus one each for Scotland and Wales. Their current role is to supervise deregulated bus services.  The purpose of last week’s hearing was examine whether Stagecoach South West was failing to comply with section 17 of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 and sections 26 and 28 of the Transport Act 1985.  A public inquiry with a traffic commissioner is the most serious form of regulatory hearing for a transport operator. It is a formal court proceeding inquiring into whether or not the bus company, and its directors and transport managers, are complying with their licence conditions and undertakings.  At the end of the inquiry the traffic commissioner decides whether to take regulatory action. This can include revoking or suspending the operator licence, reducing the number of vehicles that the company is allowed to operate, disqualifying the company or its directors from holding a licence in the future and issuing a formal warning.    Traffic commissioners have other options in such circumstances, including those outlined in this government guide.In response to questions from the commissioner and Mr Jones, Mr Watson added that the main reasons for drivers leaving were rostered shifts and, to a lesser extent, pay. He said the company’s working culture was no longer an issue.He also said that with the exception of the allocation of 60 drivers and their buses to the Commonwealth Games last year under a contract agreed at Stagecoach Group level, the company had abandoned its lucrative non-scheduled business to give priority to maintaining scheduled services, although pay increases and other inflation-driven costs would eventually have to be funded by increasing fares.It had considered using subcontractors to run some services, but recognised that the effort required to train them to Stagecoach standards would be better deployed to training the company’s own new staff.He said its decision to centralise customer contact services in Perth had been taken before the pandemic had led to a large increase in the number of people seeking assistance, and a local resource had since been re-established.He also said that the company’s app was generally effective at providing service information – particularly via its live maps – though problems remained with data accuracy which were being addressed.Editor’s note: Stagecoach Devon Limited is the registered name of Stagecoach South West but as the latter is in common use the company has been referred to this way above."

"content" : "When Exeter City Council’s planning committee met last month to decide whether to grant permission to build a pair of student/co-living blocks on the site of the former police station and magistrates’ court on Heavitree Road, the development design had already been through seven iterations.Proposals for the site that were originally put forward in July 2020 had apparently been so comprehensively revised after passing through three independent design review panels and as many rounds of public consultation that council development director Ian Collinson felt able to enthusiastically recommend what he described as a “high quality development”.He said its design had been “significantly amended” in response to the objections that had been raised, that the blocks would deliver “substantial economic, social and environmental benefits” and that their extreme residential densities would align with the council’s Liveable Exeter property development scheme.Illustrative aerial view from south east. Image: TP Bennett.The committee members saw things differently. They voted on a range of reasons to refuse the application from offshore-registered PBSA Heavitree Road S.A.R.L. and the office of the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner.These included the adverse impact of the proposed development’s scale, mass and siting, the insufficient residential amenity space it provided, the harm it would do to the surrounding area and its residents and the loss of 26 trees on the site. They then sent Mr Collinson away to support their objections with relevant planning policies.He duly returned to the following committee meeting a fortnight ago with “full technical reasons for refusal”, carefully crafted by planning officers to present the strongest possible case for the council’s decision in the face of an expected appeal challenge.However Mr Collinson also said that the applicants, having already asked to defer the decision from the committee’s July to September meeting, now wanted to defer it again, this time from October to December, which will be the sixth time council planning committee members have convened to consider their proposals.He recommended the deferral to allow an eighth design revision followed by a fourth review panel assessment and yet another round of public consultation, and “to ensure that any proposals considered at appeal are the most appropriate for the area”. In the meeting he said: “All the applicant has asked for is a bit more time”.Illustrative aerial view from south west. Image: TP Bennett.Neil Howells, speaking at the meeting on the applicants’ behalf, claimed that all the reasons for refusal could be “addressed within the scope of the current proposals”.However many of the committee’s objections had been raised by the first design review panel nearly two years ago, and the same issues were “still considered relevant” when committee members met in September last year to consider what were by then being described as “significantly revised proposals”.Rather than further amending the design in discussion with officers and councillors and seeking feedback on its proposals directly from the public before formally applying for planning permission, the developers then went ahead and submitted this set of plans unchanged.As a result, as multiple design revisions have followed, council officers have been compelled to hold three rounds of public consultation and prepare reports and presentations for three council planning committee meetings. Now another of each must take place too.Meanwhile none of the 115 comments made by members of the public who have managed to participate in the planning process despite the impediments created by the applicants’ approach are in favour.The developers have so far submitted 130 application documents, 51 of which have been superseded at one stage or another, and generated dozens of correspondence threads, many of which have to be revisited each time the proposals are further revised.Despite all this the plans for the site remain essentially unaltered since their submission.

Their latest iteration proposes a seven storey student accommodation block opposite the university’s St Luke’s campus which would provide 677 bedrooms in a mix of cluster flats and self-contained studios, none of which meet national minimum space standards, arranged around two small courtyards.Beside would stand an eight storey “co-living” block providing 358 even smaller self-contained studios built around a single courtyard. Most would squeeze a bathroom, kitchen, sitting area, bedspace and, apparently, workspace into less than 19 square metres.Council officers said they were “content that the scale and massing of the proposals positively respond to the context of the site in terms of respecting the character and appearance of the area”.Labour councillor Matt Vizard disagreed. He described the proposed buildings as “a blot on the landscape” with a “blandly modern, suffocating frontage [that] will dominate and jar badly with the historic and much admired architecture and aesthetics of the St Luke’s campus opposite”.Labour’s Emma Morse said the design was not taking the surrounding area into account while Labour’s Bob Foale called it a “carbuncle” and Labour’s Marina Asvachin said it was “hideous”.Undaunted, Ian Collinson presented the design as “strong and bold architecture, appropriate for an ambitious and confident city like Exeter” which would “repair some of the urban fabric along a key gateway to the city centre”.He added adding that bringing the site frontage forward to “address Heavitree Road” would improve on the current development footprint, which he said makes “no contribution to the street scene”.Liberal Democrat Michael Mitchell also disagreed. He said the design revisions hadn’t improved the visual impact at all and that the proximity of the proposed frontage to the pavement would destroy the good example of adjacent buildings which are set back from the road.Illustrative ground floor plan. Image: TP Bennett.The student accommodation block would provide just 1.8 square metres of internal communal amenity space per bedroom, while all the internal communal amenity space in the co-living building would add up to just 2.5 square metres per studio.Council planning officers nevertheless said they were “of the view that the quality of amenity that will be provided within the proposed co-living block is acceptable”.External amenity space would not make up for the cramped conditions in this block: its courtyard would provide less than 1 square metre of space per studio. The situation would be only slightly better next door, where each bedroom would come with 1.14 square metres of courtyard space.The council’s own public and green spaces team criticised the design for providing “limited private garden space for residents” and “little in the way of open space or play provision on site”, forcing all its inhabitants to use nearby public green spaces.Council planning officers nevertheless accepted the development’s “reliance on existing public open spaces nearby to provide outdoor amenity and recreational space”.All three councillors for Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s, the ward in which the development site is located, were critical of this aspect of the proposals. Independent Jemima Moore said such low levels of outdoor amenity space would be detrimental to the health of occupants while Labour’s Matt Vizard and Richard Branston both highlighted the insufficiency of the courtyards to meet the needs of more than a thousand residents.Were each of the 1035 bedrooms currently proposed at the 1.25 hectare Heavitree Road site only to have a single occupant, the development would have a density of 828 inhabitants per hectare, nearly 30 times Exeter’s average of a little less than 28 inhabitants per hectare. And there appears to be nothing to prevent couples sharing the studios.This would be considerably higher than the extreme densities proposed for the Liveable Exeter redevelopment at Haven Banks and vastly greater than the density recommended for the area in the LDA Design density study which forms part of the new Exeter local plan evidence base.Illustrative typical floor plan. Image: TP Bennett.Affordability received little attention from planning committee members, notwithstanding prospective rent levels at the co-living block nearing completion next door, which would mean many local key workers living below minimum income threshold even in “affordable” studios.The prospective Heavitree Road student block operator, which manages more than fifty similar developments across the country, offers cluster flat rooms in Bristol that start at £776pcm and studios in Bath from £1,187pcm. It says that the Heavitree Road co-living block would provide “an alternative affordable housing solution for young professionals and key workers”.Ian Collinson concurred, saying that the development would provide “much-needed” accommodation for students and young people and that “priority will be given to essential local workers” for the 20% of co-living units that would be offered at a 20% discount on market rents.How such workers would be prioritised is unexplained, as at the adjacent development. Will these rooms be held empty until “essential local workers” apply to live in them? Or will they be filled by whoever applies for them first, with “essential” workers prioritised over others only if they apply at the same time?And how could such workers afford them in the first place? Apparently on the basis they are “likely to be in the price range of young people who can’t obtain a mortgage”, according to council officers, who did not to supply any evidence to support this claim.Existing Heavitree Road elevation facing St Luke’sConservative Anne Jobson said it was disingenuous to say they would be affordable for key workers, Matt Vizard pointed out that co-living remains unproven in Exeter as none has yet been let and Michael Mitchell cast doubt on the demand for such accommodation in the city, citing the long-stalled redevelopment of Harlequins shopping centre.Michael Mitchell also said that the Heavitree Road proposals would, at best, provide short-term accommodation, rather than the homes that the council’s Liveable Exeter property development scheme is supposed to deliver. Anne Jobson added that, as the developers confirmed last year, the proposed studios are “not suitable for families or couples with small children”.The prospective Heavitree Road co-living block operator doesn’t even intend to offer security of tenure or exclusive occupation rights to residents. The licenses to occupy it intends to issue instead of tenancy agreements confer neither, while allowing it to enter at any time without notice and to summarily evict with just two weeks’ warning.Unlike tenancy agreements, such licenses allow residents no recourse to the courts to challenge eviction. When the developer refused to agree to the minimum three month tenancies proposed by council officers in pre-application discussion it said issuing tenancy agreements would “impact on the flexibility needed to ensure the viability of the proposals”.Council leader Phil Bialyk nevertheless said he thinks the co-living concept is a “good principle”. Council development portfolio holder Emma Morse added: “I actually don’t mind co-living”, referring to a holiday in The Netherlands during which she “looked at the tiny homes principles” and found herself thinking that “there is actually a conversation to be had with co-living”.Both sit on the planning committee despite Local Government Association guidance which explicitly advises against the council leader and portfolio holder doing so. Neither said whether they intend to move from their hilltop houses, which have large gardens, are surrounded by fields and trees and are together the size of fifteen of the proposed Heavitree Road studios to explore these principles in practice.Illustrative proposed Heavitree Road elevation facing St Luke’s. Image: TP Bennett.If neither Heavitree Road block would provide homes, given all the other limitations they have, what is their value supposed to be? In chorus with every apologist for the short-term accommodation development that has become rife in Exeter in recent years, council officers claim they would “free up existing housing stock for use as family dwellings”.The power of purpose-built student accommodation to release residential houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) for their intended use has assumed legendary status in Exeter, with co-living recently added to the pantheon. Unfortunately there is no evidence to support the claim that the number of HMOs in the city has fallen as these blocks have been built, as Michael Mitchell said.This is essentially because the university has expanded so rapidly that the number of students living here during term-time, which has tripled over the past fifteen years, has massively outpaced the rate of development delivery.According to information obtained from the university under freedom of information legislation, there were 39,000 students based at its Exeter campuses during the 2012-22 academic year. That’s just under 30% of the city’s 130,800 inhabitants.The council’s own consultants recently confirmed that 58% of Exeter’s university students live in residential housing stock. This suggests that as many as 6,500 homes may be in use as student HMOs.Ian Collinson’s response to Michael Mitchell was simply that the university wants to grow. That the draft of the new Exeter local plan, for which Mr Collinson is responsible, has nothing to say about this issue, and doesn’t even mention co-living, strongly suggests that the council has no intention of intervening to constrain it.

Cornwall Council, for example, prohibits any changes that would trigger new public consultations on existing proposals.While Exeter City Council does not have such a policy, Ian Collinson did say, when asked, that “there are limits to what an applicant can do to change an application while it’s being considered”, adding that the proposals eighth iteration “would broadly be the same application, in terms of the mix of uses, with broadly the [same] number of homes”.He also said, and Emma Morse confirmed, that should the committee refuse the revised application at its December meeting it would do so on the same basis as before. Neither explained how the same reasons for refusal that had applied in September could be reapplied to proposals to which the applicant’s representative insisted there would be “significant changes”.Trees beside the former magistrates’ courtSeveral councillors expressed scepticism. Matt Vizard said: “Any revised application needs to address all the reasons that were cited for refusal, and comprehensively so”, saying his concern was that there may be a “fundamental problem with this application”.Labour’s Rob Hannaford asked how realistic it was to expect that the applicants could address the committee’s concerns given the likely impact on scheme viability. Michael Mitchell said he hoped they would make major changes as “the existing application is totally unsuitable for the site”. The Green Party’s Diana Moore expressed doubt that the changes would be significant.Anne Jobson said that whatever happened, the committee would still be “dealing with buildings that we decided on the last occasion were just not appropriate for this particular site”, adding that it was clear why the committee had opposed the design and that Neil Howells had failed to give her “any assurance that this is going to be a substantially different scheme” that would “meet the needs of residents of Exeter, particularly key workers and those who need homes”.Emma Morse sought to reassure committee members that they could still refuse the application. But she did not point out that every change to the proposals, however minor, that moves them closer to policy compliance increases the risk of a refusal being overturned at appeal.Development site boundary beside Higher Summerlands residential housingWe might also wonder whether Ian Collinson is on a collision course with councillors over the Liveable Exeter property development scheme after expressing such strong support for the Heavitree Road proposals. As at Haven Banks, the applicants are clearly convinced that the design they submitted last July is aligned with the “ambitions of the Liveable Exeter agenda”, not least because council officers have told them as much.Matt Vizard was, however, in no doubt that the Heavitree Road scheme doesn’t meet the Liveable Exeter “vision”. So exercised was he on behalf of what he described as “the long standing residents of modest, mixed housing on Higher Summerlands and St Matthew’s Court” who he said “would be faced with a looming block just a few metres away” that “would dominate their landscape” that he said the proposals should be refused “to restore their faith in the planning process”.Anne Jobson added that the scheme wouldn’t deliver on Exeter’s ostensible garden city aspirations. Revealingly, Ian Collinson responded by saying that the Liveable Exeter garden city “principles” cover lots of issues, suggesting they are sufficiently flexible to mean whatever their authors want.Perhaps this is the basis on which Neil Howells said that “the proposals are consistent with the new Exeter local plan”? This frames the “Liveable Exeter delivery principles” in terms so vague that property developers presumably expect them not to get in their way.Certainly, with the scheme barely begun, developers are coming forward under the Liveable Exeter banner with plans for hundreds of unaffordable sub-standard bedsits with inadequate amenity space that deny their occupants tenancy rights at densities among the highest in the world which won’t address Exeter’s housing crisis and hardly anyone could call a home.

(The party would like to win back the Heavitree seat it lost to Carol Bennett last year and the Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s seat it lost to Jemima Moore in 2019.)The thinking was that while approving an unpopular, high-profile development at the heart of one ward and en route for the other would greatly increase the chances of their political opponents prevailing in both, postponing the outcome to appeal would mitigate this risk.Indeed, five days after the September meeting, Matt Vizard told a Newtown Community Association meeting that while he hoped the applicants would further discuss their proposals with the council he thought it more likely they would go straight to appeal.Others reckon that the subsequent deferral is intended to reduce the risk of another major council loss at appeal following significant decisions against it at Spruce Close and Redhills. (Since the committee’s October meeting the council has also lost significant appeals at the former Exeter Royal Academy for Deaf Education site and Clyst Road.)However, while the cost of fighting such appeals is a consideration, these decisions do not put the council at risk of falling foul of the government’s criteria for assessing local planning authority performance.So the question appears to be, however significant or otherwise the changes made during the current iteration of the Heavitree Road redevelopment proposals, whether it would be worse to refuse then lose at appeal after next year’s local elections or to approve an unpopular decision just before Christmas in the hope everybody will be looking the other way."

"content" : "Redeveloping a strategically-significant site that is only a stone’s throw from Exeter’s historic quay and canal basin was always unlikely to be plain sailing. The sensitivity of the surroundings and the impact of the proposals on the many who live nearby, and more who regularly visit the area, all needed careful navigation to avoid deep water.Developer Coplan Estates and partner Welbeck CP have had plenty of time to chart a course around these hazards since buying the 100,000 square feet Haven Bank retail park in June 2020.Extensive pre-application consultation with planning officers, local councillors and other stakeholders, a design review panel and members of the public nevertheless led them to seek permission in August to construct 434 rental units in four blocks accommodating up to 1,167 people on the 1.7 hectare site, with cafe/restaurant and retail units on the ground floors.So when the council’s planning consultation closed last Friday they were presumably unsurprised that of 283 comments on the scheme submitted by local residents, only four were in favour.Haven Banks redevelopment proposals ground floor plan. Image: Piper Whitlock.While some respondents recognised a need to redevelop the site, many expressed concern about the scale of the proposals: the largest 336-bed block would be 50 feet taller than its existing two-storey residential neighbours.Jesamy Wood said: “Six floors of high density flats isn’t sympathetic to the beautiful and historic quayside area” while another local resident said she was “hugely concerned about the height of the buildings” adding that the “noise levels of the proposed bars that my house will back directly on to is going to be life changing.”Many criticised the lack of social or family housing in the plans, singling out the co-living units in particular. Steven Hodge said the proposed development “addresses none of the reasons local people cannot afford to buy” while Judith Gale described it as “poor quality housing, particularly the bedsits” which she said “should not be regarded as homes and must not be approved.”Others cited the impact of new residents on local healthcare services and roads, and said removing the 220-space retail car park would have significant knock-on effects. Erik de Bie said car parks in the area were already often fully occupied while illegal parking on double yellow lines made it difficult for emergency vehicles to access the area.Harriet Turner said it was inevitable that new residents and site visitors would have cars, adding that “public transport in Exeter is appalling and although a walk into town from the site is not far, people use their cars for work and commuting.” She concluded that the developer’s “assumption that it will be a car free zone is utterly ridiculous”.Computer generated aerial view of proposed development from south. Image: Piper Whitlock.The Environment Agency also emphatically objected to the proposals, citing their failure to satisfy sections of the National Planning Policy Framework — sufficient to scupper the scheme because the Haven Banks site is at high risk of flooding.The government body said the developer’s Flood Risk Assessment did not pass muster, not least because it proposed evacuating occupants through flood defences and across the flooded waters of the River Exe, which it said would be “very unsafe”, presenting a “risk to life once flood levels breach out of the ‘normal’ river channel”.It also criticised the developer for falsely claiming that it supported the proposals, saying that since the beginning of this year it had “informed the applicant of our numerous concerns that needed to be fully resolved before we would not object to any subsequent planning application”.It added: “Our correspondence in May, June and July 2022 (before submission) and August 2022 (after submission) again expressed our concerns with significant elements of the Flood Risk Assessment and principles of the scheme”.It warned the developer that it would maintain its objection unless an assessment was produced which “demonstrates that the development is safe from flooding over its lifetime”, saying that “the only solution in this area of Exeter is to be part of a wider strategic solution” which it had previously laid out.This would involve using a nearby railway embankment as a flood escape route, which it said the Haven Banks development would need to access “via a new pedestrian bridge over the live railway line”.The embankment flood escape route would be intended for use by all the Liveable Exeter development sites in the Water Lane and Marsh Barton areas.Proposed Haven Banks blocks C &amp;amp; D elevations. Image: Piper Whitlock.As Haven Banks is the first significant site to come forward in the area it appears its developer may have to swallow the flood risk mitigation costs in order to proceed, although with plans for much of the rest of the Water Lane area expected to follow before the end of the year it may seek to share the load.However flood risk isn’t the only issue the Haven Banks proposals raise about the “Liveable Exeter principles” on which the developer says its scheme is based.It presents the scheme as a “vibrant garden community” which will form part of the Water Lane “urban village” and includes Liveable Exeter concept sketches in its application to press the point.But the scheme’s density and amenity levels are about as far from Ebenezer Howard’s garden city vision as they could be, notwithstanding the government’s appropriation of the idea for the “new wave of garden towns and villages” it has promoted for the past eight years and in which Exeter became embroiled in 2019.Exeter’s average housing density is currently just over twelve dwellings per hectare, having increased slightly from just under eleven dwellings per hectare over the past decade. This figure, which is about half the average across London, includes green and other open spaces.Typical housing densities in Exeter’s residential areas range from 20 to 90 dwellings per hectare, with high density city centre studio flats above 190 dwellings per hectare, according to an LDA Design study which forms part of the new Exeter local plan evidence base.The Haven Banks scheme proposes a density of 255 dwellings per hectare, twenty one times the current Exeter average and more than double the density recommended for this area in the study.Street level view of development site from adjacent Chandlers Walk showing rear of existing retail park. Image: Haven Banks Residents Group.The LDA Design study says: “For residential development, the number of dwellings per hectare is the most widely used metric for assessing density and is considered the most appropriate means of measuring density for this document”, although it offers no evidence to support this claim.And it treats student accommodation differently, counting the number of bedrooms in cluster flats instead, although it does not appear to count houses in multiple occupation the same way.Adopting this approach to the Haven Banks scheme reveals a density of 345 bedrooms per hectare, but still doesn’t meaningfully capture the density of the proposals, which show two people occupying most, although not all, rooms.The Haven Banks developers propose that as many as 1,167 people will live on the site, with up to six people sharing one unit. Counting inhabitants per hectare, instead of dwellings, is a more appropriate density metric in such circumstances, and is also widely used.Exeter’s 130,800 inhabitants share the city’s 4,704 hectares at an average density of a little less than 28 inhabitants per hectare. The Haven Banks scheme proposes a density of 686 inhabitants per hectare, nearly twenty five times the Exeter average.This is significantly greater than the density in the centre of Manila, the world’s most densely populated city, where 1.85 million people live in a sixteen square mile area only slightly smaller than Exeter.Computer generated street level view of proposed development from adjacent Chandlers Walk. The developer has not prepared images showing the visual impact of its proposals from this direction. Image: Haven Banks Residents Group.Are the “Liveable Exeter principles” intended to produce development designs at such extreme densities? The outline draft of the new local plan says Liveable Exeter principle number two is to build at what it calls “optimal density”, which it does not otherwise define, although it does say that the purpose of doing so is to support a significant increase in affordable housing provision.The new local plan instead relies on the LDA Design study for density specifics. This says: “High density development also means improving affordability and providing better accessibility to housing of all types and tenure, so that for example, people have options to remain within existing neighbourhoods when growing a family, as well as down-sizing in later life.”The Haven Banks developer says that just one fifth of the 246 build-to-rent units will be offered at 20% discounts against market rates while no affordable co-living units will be provided at all, which it says council planning officers agreed in advance.It also says the council agreed that it would not have to supply a viability assessment to support its application, a document which would reveal just how profitable it expects the scheme to be.Street level view of development site from adjacent Stream Court.

Image: Haven Banks Residents Group.Without knowing how much the Haven Banks units are expected to cost to rent it is impossible to know how affordable they might be at a 20% discount, although council planning committee members are free to press the developer on this aspect of its proposals.However as the smallest one bed flats at Haven Banks would be nearly three times the size of the co-living rooms at The Gorge, Exeter’s first such development, and those rooms are set to start at £946pcm, it seems likely that they will be accessible to few who rely on local wages to rent.As at The Gorge, this raises the question whether the Haven Banks blocks are intended for occupation by students with well-heeled parents. At a presentation in May, a representative of the developer admitted that it envisaged many units being filled by recent graduates, their parents footing the bill until they move elsewhere for better wages and job opportunities, to be replaced by the following year’s cohort.Who else would pay around £1,000pcm for a co-living bedsit, or more for a multiple occupancy flat? The developer says that “occupiers will include young professionals, key workers in health and other sectors, local people looking for their first independent home, those new to the area or with a local work connection that need a flexible contract”.It claims that co-living rooms are “typically available at lower rental levels than traditional residential studios and house or flat-shares”, that they “offer good value for money” and that they are in demand by “a significant proportion of prospective residents [who] can no longer afford to rent or buy within the traditional housing market”.It also says that “co-living provides a rung on the student, to co-living, to build to rent, to house ownership staircase through life”, although it does not explain how ascending this way would be possible on typical Exeter incomes.Computer generated street level view of proposed development from adjacent Stream Court. The developer has not prepared images showing the visual impact of its proposals from this direction. Image: Haven Banks Residents Group.As for residential amenity, supposedly the secret sauce that stimulates co-living demand, the developer claims that “the level of space provided is greater within the co-living proposal than it is with traditional house or flat shares and other forms of accommodation”.The council’s current residential design policy says that flats should be provided with a minimum of 20 square metres of directly-accessible communal space per dwelling with additional private outdoor amenity space, either in gardens (at a minimum of 3 metres deep and the width of the dwelling they serve) or balconies (at a minimum of 6 square metres).The developer counters that this policy is “significantly out of date with the current drive for optimisation and intensification” and that, in any case, the policy does not necessarily apply to large developments. It also says that council planning officers “concurred with this viewpoint”.As a result, the proposals would only provide 2.25 square metres of private external amenity space, 2.21 square metres of communal external amenity space and just 92 square centimetres of communal internal amenity space per person.Neither of blocks A or B, which together contain 43 flats intended to house up to 125 people, would provide any communal internal amenity space at all. Block C, which contains 203 flats intended to house up to 666 people, would provide just 77 square centimetres of communal internal amenity space per person.And block D’s 188 co-living units, which are stacked over five floors, would mean as many as 376 people sharing a single ground floor communal internal amenity space which is supposed to be both lounge and workspace rolled into one.The LDA Design density study recommends this sort of arrangement on the Water Lane and Marsh Barton Liveable Exeter sites, which it describes as “live/work typologies and apartments above workspaces”.Presumably it does not intend to license the densities proposed by the Haven Banks developers, although it only recommends minimum, not maximum, densities for inclusion in Exeter planning decisions. The new local plan outline draft has nothing to say about residential amenity at all.Proposed Haven Banks access plan. Image: Piper Whitlock.The new local plan’s overarching draft spatial strategy does, however, say that development should be delivered at “optimal densities to minimise the need to travel and maximise walking, cycling and public transport”.This is underscored by the density study’s statement that “encouraging reduced levels of car ownership as residents live closer to public transport hubs, employment and services” is one of “numerous advantages of building at higher densities in the right locations”.The introduction to the Haven Banks development access proposals offers useful insight into whether development densities really do instrumentally reduce car ownership and induce active travel and public transport use.It says: “Principal access to Haven Banks is provided from the A377 Alphington Road, which in turn forms a connecting route to Junction 31 of the M5 (via the A30) to the south of Exeter. The site is therefore conveniently located in terms of access from the wider strategic highway network”.Of course, elsewhere the developer also says: “In line with the Liveable Exeter concept/vision we propose that the development should seek to further reduce vehicular movements and reliance on cars”. The proposals accordingly include just 32 parking spaces, five of which are for car club use and two allocated to blue badge holders.In addition a lay-by, a loading bay and three small delivery bays are proposed for residential and commercial deliveries, waste and recycling collections and taxi pick-ups and drop-offs.The developer claims that just 26 light goods vehicle deliveries would take place each day and that its proposals would entail “significant benefit to the functioning of the local highway network” because they “would likely result in approximately 1,183 fewer two-way vehicle trips over the course of a typical weekday”.Haven Banks parking plan. Image reproduced from Ordnance Survey map data by permission of Ordnance Survey, Crown Copyright 2022.The developer also claims that there is “ample spare capacity within nearby car parks to accommodate vehicles which historically would have used the application site”, of which there would apparently be just 48 at any given time.To mitigate their impact on the three remaining Haven Banks car parks, which together provide 215 spaces – five fewer than the existing site car park – the developer cites “a further 2,346 public car parking spaces in Exeter city centre, within a twelve minute walk of the site”.The comma is key in this claim. It is not that there are 2,346 public car parking spaces within a twelve minute walk of the site, but that there are 2,346 public car parking spaces in the city centre, the nearest edge of which can be reached on foot from the site in twelve minutes.The developer also claims that “the nature of the residential accommodation provided” is likely to imply “low car ownership levels”, adding that occupants “would be unable to utilise spaces outside of the site” because local street parking is permit-controlled, which it says “would discourage car owners from taking up residence”.It does not, however, propose to prohibit resident parking permit eligibility via the sort of section 106 development agreement used for this purpose by other local authorities.

Subscribe freeEven were the remaining Haven Banks car parks to meet the needs of so many new residents on top of all the other drivers who already use them, they would surely overflow when the adjacent Water Lane and Marsh Barton sites are developed along the same Liveable Exeter lines.Development densities alone do not minimise the need to travel and maximise walking, cycling and public transport use. Higher housing densities do not confer greater utility on public transport services (whether or not bus stops or railway stations are found nearby) any more than they encourage the propensity to cycle or walk.Network routes, cost and service frequency and reliability on the one hand and journey distances, gradients and the provision of safe infrastructure from door to door on the other are of far greater importance.Nor is residential proximity to workplaces a function of density. Exeter’s key employment sites are spread across the city, with eleven of twelve outside the city centre. If only one in twelve occupants of the proposed Haven Banks development work within walking distance, more than a thousand would not.The Haven Banks developer may yet tack back against the Environment Agency’s objections to its flood evacuation plans. Whether it should be given a green light to build at extreme densities that deny amenity to prospective occupants while inflicting significant impacts on existing residents is another matter, especially when its justification for doing so is based on such wishful thinking about transport and mobility.Simply presenting the scheme as a “vibrant garden community” doesn’t make it so. As local resident William Westlake said, responding to the council’s planning consultation, the development “appears to have been designed to maximise the number of occupants and thereby garner the largest profit rather than create a positive living and retail space.”"

"content" : "When the new chancellor launched the government’s growth plan a fortnight ago during his disastrous autumn statement, misnamed a “mini” budget despite its maximal impact, he confirmed that the government was discussing the creation of what it called “investment zones” in 38 local authority areas.Exeter residents and businesses may have been relieved to read that while Cornwall, Plymouth and Somerset councils were among those that had seized the chance of setting up freeports on steroids on their turf, Devon – and by extension Exeter – had not.The growth plan didn’t have much to say about the new zones, but it did make clear that they would involve planning deregulation intended to speed up development as well as a range of tax breaks for businesses.An accompanying factsheet said: “The need for planning applications will be minimised and where planning applications remain necessary, they will be radically streamlined.”Last week, however, the government invited the remaining local authorities in England to get involved in the scheme, having published more detailed guidance on its plans for the zones.They include planning “simplifications” that will “cut back unnecessary bureaucratic requirements and processes and red tape that slow down development” with a “faster and more streamlined consent to grant planning permission” intended to “reduce many of the burdensome requirements” of current planning policy.There is particular emphasis on reducing “lengthy consultation with statutory bodies” and relaxing “key national and local policy requirements” alongside calls to action such as “the planning system will not stand in the way of investment and development”.Exeter City Council outline draft local plan site allocations: the Liveable Exeter sites marked in blue could all become deregulated investment zonesSo Green party councillor Amy Sparling’s question to Labour city council leader Phil Bialyk at a scrutiny meeting last Thursday was pertinent and timely: she wanted to confirm what the council’s response to the government’s invitation would be and, in particular, that it would not lead to planning deregulation in Exeter.Despite Labour shadow minister Lisa Nandy warning that affordable housing provision and environmental protections would be at risk in new investment zones, and attacking the plans as “reckless”, the council leader said that “officers are exploring how investment zones could support the long-term viability of sites including those identified as Liveable Exeter”.However much the council, and those promoting Exeter Development Fund, might like the sound of long-term tax waivers covering profits, stamp duty and capital spending on Liveable Exeter development sites, it needs to tread very carefully.The government’s investment zone application guidance makes clear that eligibility for the scheme is conditional on confirmation that council leaders support the zones in principle, and seeks agreement from councils that they will adopt a “new streamlined overarching planning system” intended to fast-track planning consent in the zones before spelling out what the new system might look like.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            As Town and Country Planning Association policy director Hugh Ellis says, investment zones are “designed to be the ideological avant-garde for a concept which the government would like to apply on a much wider basis”. Namely the zonal planning reforms which the government tried to introduce in 2020 but dropped “because it was clearly about stripping out democracy and basic standards from the planning process”.Even without these considerations, there is little evidence that deregulated, low tax zones deliver the economic benefits that politicians promise. A Centre for Cities study found that the previous generation of such zones mostly displaced jobs, without creating them, and those they did create were “mainly in low-skilled local service activities”. Nor do they boost economic performance, according to the Office of Budget Responsibility.However many investment zones the government creates, and it does look like being many, they will confer next to no competitive advantage as each will have to go head to head with all the others for the same, limited investment sources. At the same time affordable housing provision and environmental protections will be at risk wherever they are introduced."

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s borrowing has nearly tripled over the past three years as it has made large loans to its property development company Exeter City Living, financed the construction of the £42 million St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre and spent £44 million purchasing the Guildhall shopping centre leasehold.It has also bought office blocks including Senate Court in Southernhay Gardens, for which it paid nearly £10 million , and increased its Housing Revenue Account debt by borrowing an additional £15 million to finance the construction of social housing.The council’s total borrowing from the government Public Works Loan Board facility, which provides loans for capital projects, stood at £168 million at the end of March this year, according to its unaudited 2021-22 statement of accounts. Its net budget for interest payments in 2022-23 is more than £2.6 million.However its capital financing requirement, the amount it has an underlying need to borrow to finance capital expenditure based on its plans, is set to soar. The council currently expects it to nearly double over the four years to March 2025 to just over £300 million.The council already owned the freehold of the 300,000 square feet Guildhall shopping centre when it decided to create a £55 million budget to buy the leasehold in October last year. The remaining £11 million is allocated for its redevelopment, although it says it has no plans to redevelop the site for the forseeable future.The decision, which was supposedly made as “part of the Liveable Exeter vision”, may have breached local government transparency regulations as it was taken in private without sufficient notice.Local authority borrowing via the government Public Works Loan Board facility to enable the acquisition of assets bought primarily for yield has not been permitted since March 2020. This change in policy followed an increase in councils using this lending facility to borrow money at lower than market rates to buy investment property purely for rental income.In the three years to 2019 local authorities spent £6.6 billion buying commercial property – fourteen times more than during the preceding three years – of which as much as 90% was financed by borrowing. A National Audit Office report highlighted how some councils would be significantly exposed in the event of a recession or property market crash.The city council, however, was given permission to use Public Works Loan Board financing to purchase the Guildhall shopping centre leasehold provided it uses surplus rental income for regeneration activity, even if not at the shopping centre site. It therefore intends to cover the £900,000 cost of demolishing the old bus station this way, having unsuccessfully bid for Levelling Up funding for the project.The council has also transferred the leasehold of the shopping centre’s residential units to Exeter City Living to prevent tenants gaining occupancy rights as a result of the overall sale which could have later prevented the council evicting them “for asset management purposes”.The council presented a report on the shopping centre leasehold purchase to its executive committee in July. Like the decision to create the £55 million budget to buy the leasehold, the report was not published and the press and public were excluded from the meeting when it was discussed.In the same way as it sought to delay its response to a freedom of information request for a report on its decision to pave the way for a 186-bed “co-living” block in Summerland Street, the council claimed that “the complexity and volume of the information” made it “impracticable” to respond to a freedom of information request for the Guildhall shopping centre report the within the time limits permitted by law.Like the Summerland Street report, the council took two months to release the Guildhall shopping centre report, twice as long as allowed by law. It was also just three pages long, including redactions for which the council failed to supply the justifications required by law.The report includes what the council describes as an “outline business plan for the asset going forward” which extends to just five paragraphs and makes vague propositions for which no supporting information or documentation is supplied.These include the production of “an asset strategy to strengthen the [shopping] centre’s position as Exeter’s leading leisure, food and beverage and socialising destination” and the “possibility” of exploring “closer integration of management of the [shopping] centre and the Guildhall car park to enhance the continuity of the customer journey which should boost usage and coordination across the functions”.The council also claims that “the asset presents a significant future opportunity to implement transformative change within the city centre, building upon the regeneration initiatives already underway and in the pipeline and contributing to the Liveable Exeter aspirational prospectus” and says “creating synergies” with the widely-criticised Harlequins co-living redevelopment (on which work has yet to begin) will be “fundamental to implementing successful step change”.

Subscribe freeThe report does not mention the high churn rate in the Queen Street flank of the shopping centre following its £12 million redevelopment in 2016. Only three of the original eight food and drink businesses have survived: three closed before the pandemic struck. The scheme’s promotional website can’t keep up: The Stable, which shut more than two years ago, still features, as does Absurd Bird, which closed more recently.Nor does the report mention what the Financial Times described as Exeter’s “startlingly poor” in-person sales performance during the pandemic, or the Centre for Cities 2022 outlook report which found that Exeter had experienced among the highest reductions in bricks and mortar fashion retail sales in the country.A recent sector-wide report by Knight Frank, the firm which marketed the Guildhall leasehold sale, found that the structural issues facing shopping centres were firmly in place before the pandemic, and that while shopping centre income from leisure spending has risen slightly, large falls in other areas have decisively offset it as part of an overall decline.Meanwhile no-one should be in any doubt about the extent to which the UK’s economic crisis is likely to constrain the discretionary spending power of all but the most wealthy, even if the city council’s leadership were insufficiently informed this time last year to pause for thought before deciding to invest £55 million of public money in a retail and leisure destination.As Harry Badham, who oversees development and asset repositioning for Hammerson, a major UK shopping centre operator, said in an interview earlier this year: “Anyone in any sector who denies there’s going to be change and thinks they can sit back and collect rent for fifteen years is going to be mincemeat”."

Exeter’s includes one such plan which covers the St James area.An existing evidence base also supports and informs local planning policy development.Exeter City Council outline draft local plan site allocationsThe timetable for the preparation of the new local plan is set out in the Local Development Scheme, which was last updated in June 2021:  September 2021: an initial consultation framed the content and scope of the plan  September 2022: the resulting outline draft plan has been published for a public consultation running from 26 September to 19 December  February 2023: a revised detailed draft plan (the “publication” version) will be published for formal comments (“representations”) on its legal compliance and soundness  June 2023: the resulting detailed draft final plan will be submitted to the planning inspectorate with formal comments and supporting evidence  October 2023: a planning inspector will examine the submissions, hold plan examination hearings, propose changes (which may entail further consultation) then produce a final report  June 2024: the final plan will be adopted.Only those who submit formal comments at the revised detailed draft plan publication stage can attend and take part in plan examination hearings.The council has been saying that an additional round of public consultation will take place before the draft final plan will be submitted to the planning inspectorate, however the formal development scheme does not mention this stage and would need to be changed to accommodate it.As the publication version of the plan is currently supposed to be ready in February 2023, a deadline the council cannot meet, it appears the plan delivery timetable has already slipped.Plan preparation progress is set out in annual monitoring reports, while periodic statements set out the city’s five year housing land supply position.The 2021-22 progress monitoring report was published at the end of last year.At the same time as Exeter prepares its new local plan, national planning system reform is on the way based on ideas which survived the failure of the 2020 planning white paper.The government subsequently published its 2022 Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill, parts of which it claimed would give “local leaders and communities the tools they need to make better places”.The Town and County Planning Association disagreed, describing it as a “decisive shift of power to Whitehall” which includes the removal of existing rights in relation to the planning process and new powers for the government to change the system through secondary legislation and override local planning policy in decision-making.The Local Government Association has published a useful analysis of the bill’s planning provisions.New detailed design codes are also expected, which can be used to set stringent standards in much greater detail than planning policy documents.They can cover environmental and energy efficiency standards, walking and cycling infrastructure specifications and public realm requirements, among many other development delivery details, and are expected to come into force before the new Exeter Local Plan is adopted.

The levelling-up bill was expected to reach royal assent in spring 2023, with secondary legislation to follow in 2024 and a transition period to allow “new style local plans” to be “delivered and adopted in waves” scheduled for completion by 2027.However the bill’s status was cast into doubt under Liz Truss, who appointed yet another secretary of state to run the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, the eighth holder of the post under the Conservative administration.The growth plan announced during her brief premiership reasserted the government’s intention to turn the planning system upside down. Changes included planning deregulation to accelerate development which appeared to put affordable housing provision and environmental protections at risk in new “investment zones”.The zones have since been scrapped, following Michael Gove’s reappointment as levelling-up secretary in new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s cabinet. His return has meant a revival of the erstwhile bill and a more moderate approach to planning reform than was expected under his predecessor.However one key change that was announced under Liz Truss that could have major significance for Exeter has been retained: the abolition of the housing delivery targets central government imposes on local authorities.Michael Gove initially said he intended to retain the targets, but as many as 100 Conservative MPs have since supported amendments to the levelling-up bill aimed at their abolition as well as reform of the five year housing land supply rule.He subsequently confirmed that the government would amend the bill to water down the targets in a letter to Tory MPs.The extent of prospective national planning system reform remains unclear. It may well alter the policy framework so much that the version of the new Exeter local plan that was presented for consultation last autumn could need significant revision before it is submitted to the planning inspectorate for examination.Whatever happens next, Exeter should remain concerned about becoming a politically-palatable location for mass housebuilding. It is far from both red and blue walls and held by a Labour incumbent."

"content" : "Hundreds of towns and cities around the world take bold strides each year towards reducing the dominance of cars in their streets on or around world car free day.This aim, which is essential not only to climate change mitigation but also the transformation of urban space into places for people, is supposed to be one of twelve goals which form the basis of Exeter City Futures’ Net Zero Exeter plan.This year numerous roads are being closed across the UK, including Edinburgh’s Waverley Bridge and The Strand in Liverpool, one of the city’s busiest streets. Vehicles have been banned from dozens of streets in London so they can be turned into safe places for children to play and communities to meet.Some local authorities have even waived the administration costs of such closures to encourage residents to take up the offer of temporarily overturning the tyranny of motor vehicles, while others have provided free bus travel to help people give up driving.Paris and Brussels have gone much further, completely closing their streets to traffic across their whole metropolitan areas last Sunday. There was a 40% drop in noise levels in Paris and nitrous oxide and nitrous dioxide concentrations fell by nearly 80% across the Brussels region as a result.Extinction Rebellion UK tour bus outside Exeter City Council’s Paris Street officesExeter’s residents and workers would be forgiven for not knowing this annual event takes place on or around 22 September. It was ignored by the city’s local authorities this year as it is every year.Purely by chance a caravan of Extinction Rebellion activists arrived in the city this morning, on the third day of a three-week UK tour taking in 60 towns and cities, with their first stop the Paris Street offices of Exeter City Council.They were there to call out the council’s inaction in response to the climate crisis, as well as it’s propensity for greenwashing.Local resident Liz Pendleton directed an impassioned speech towards council members and officers from the street, accompanied by drummers, which tore the Net Zero Exeter plan to shreds.Unfortunately council chief executive Karime Hassan was not there to listen. As the protestors gathered he was posing for a photo with a construction company development manager just around the corner in Princesshay shopping centre.Exeter City Futures promotes Exeter Development Fund at Princesshay sustainability eventWhat was he doing there? It turns out that 22 September is marked not as world car free day but as a Princesshay sustainability promotion day in Exeter’s calendar.The shopping centre had apparently “teamed up with some of our valued city partners and organisations to showcase, engage and inform visitors to Princesshay of the many environmentally conscious services and projects on offer across Exeter”.Perhaps they were stuck in traffic, or waiting for a bus, but most of the promised event partners were nowhere to be seen.Those who had turned up to grace the artificial grass mostly appeared to be with Exeter City Futures, the private company of which the council’s CEO is also the CEO.It appears the company will turn out to promote Exeter Development Fund, its private debt-driven Liveable Exeter property development financing scheme, whatever the occasion.At least they weren’t short of places to park. All three Princesshay car parks (weekday capacity 520 vehicles, with another 216 spaces at the weekend when council staff aren’t using them) remained open, as usual."

"content" : "Exeter Development Fund came under fire last Thursday at the fourth in a series of meetings at which representatives of Exeter City Futures seek to sell the property development financing scheme to the city council, led by company CEO Karime Hassan who doubles as council CEO without any acknowledged conflict of interest.As their teeth sink further into the fund proposals increasingly sceptical councillors are posing more and more questions to which the scheme’s proponents are unable to provide satisfactory answers.Governance is a major focus for councillors from across the political spectrum. Bizarrely, Exeter City Futures seems oblivious to the contradiction between its repeated claim that the council would remain in control of the fund as a consequence of its equity stake (aka sale of publicly-owned land and property assets) and the necessity that at least two other public bodies also invest equity to get the scheme off the ground.These would be another Exeter organisation that is willing to throw caution to the winds (and ignore any restrictions that come with being a charitable further or higher education institution or NHS Foundation Trust) and central government.Simply repeating that the council would be in full control as a partial shareholder won’t make it any more true than pretending that share ownership entails operational control. And as the scheme depends on  government pump-priming (whether or not board appointments would be subject to ministerial approval) it is obvious to many that its cash would confer a veto as each site comes forward with its viability gap mitigation requirements.If central government didn’t like the housing tenure mix, for example, it seems it could simply refuse to play ball until the other shareholders fall into line, retaining the whip hand throughout.Exeter Development Fund presentation slide – whose hand, whose money and is it going in or out?Then what about the influence of private investors, on which the scheme depends for the bulk of its finance? As Exeter City Futures’ Roli Martin said, the fund’s sales pitch is designed to match private investors’ appetite for rental profit. If the council tried to increase the proportion of social housing included in the scheme (there is currently none) and so reduced its yields (thus increasing debt financing requirements), private investors would not budge. So the government would have to increase its stake, which would give it yet more control.Worse, if yields fell below the levels required to service the debt and meet agreed lending terms, the assets would be at risk as they supply the security required to leverage the debt.And as the scheme would rely on long-term asset value increases to benefit the council financially, any fall in asset values would mean loss. When Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell asked about this Roli Martin said the same thing could happen to any developer. But the city council is not any developer: it is responsible for providing a range of essential statutory services and helps take care of some of the most vulnerable people in Exeter.When Michael Mitchell pressed the question, Roli Martin said the answer would depend on how the fund was structured: more government involvement would mean better insurance against catastrophe but also give the council even less control. Less government involvement would mean Exeter’s residents would take a bigger hit, as in Slough, where council tax bills are set to soar and all 6,700 council houses are to be sold off because of the failure of an overambitious property development scheme.Tellingly, when Michael Mitchell asked why central government wouldn’t just fund the whole scheme instead of relying on private investment, Roli Martin’s answer was that government would not take on the risk of property price collapse.Karime Hassan jumped in here, as he did several times during the meeting, to try to steer the discussion elsewhere. But simply saying that property investment is a one-way bet, as he did, is not enough. As Labour’s Rob Hannaford, Conservative Anne Jobson and Amy Sparling of Exeter Green Party all pointed out, councillors are guardians of public money and assets, duty bound to represent residents’ interests in their use and ensure their safety. They are not at liberty to take risks like the private sector.Exeter Development Fund presentation image – assets swimming in cash as rent is extractedAttempts to misdirect occurred every time councillors homed in on key issues. Another of these is the assumption that all 12,000 of the “Liveable Exeter” housing units the fund is intended to finance are to be built for rent, not sale. Exeter City Futures has assumed 35% of these would be charged at 80% of market rates, and so “affordable” (although NPPF does not preclude setting a lower ratio than this).However when Michael Mitchell pointed out that 80% of Exeter’s rental market rates are nowhere near affordable for most people, and Rob Hannaford said that many working people simply can’t afford to live in Exeter any more (which is having a major impact on the city’s labour supply), Exeter City Futures’ Elaine Anning tried to suggest that lower bills resulting from improved energy efficiency would make all the difference.Labour’s Trish Oliver also suggested that renting Liveable Exeter flats at market rate might be better than renting from private landlords, but with so much pressure to maintain yields against the mountain of private debt that would be required to finance the fund, more than £3 billion, it’s hard to see why this would necessarily follow.And it appears that Exeter City Futures isn’t interested in whether people could actually afford to pay the rent. When repeatedly asked to state how much a two-bedroom flat would cost to rent Elaine Anning did not answer at first, then claimed she had forgotten despite answering other detailed financial questions without hesitation. Does the company assume that prospective tenants would be so desperate because of Exeter’s housing crisis that they could be taken for granted at any price?When Trish Oliver wondered why Exeter City Futures hadn’t included any flats or houses for sale in its plans, Roli Martin admitted that the fund had been built on the assumption that Exeter property was already too unaffordable to buy. He cited the European model, in which many rent during their working lives while saving to purchase in retirement.This view doesn’t acknowledge that Exeter rent levels preclude saving for purchase for all but the highest-paid, or that European rental tenure typically confers real autonomy, unlike in the UK. A major factor in Vienna’s first place in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s 2022 global liveability index is its plentiful rent-controlled social housing. (Exeter does not appear among the 172 cities the index covers.)The reality in Exeter is less edifying: private developers at Haven Banks admit that they plan to fill their units with recent graduates, their parents footing the bill for as long as it takes them to realise that they will have to move elsewhere for decent wages and job opportunities, at which point their landlords will simply replace them with the following year’s cohort.If Exeter housing is too unaffordable to buy, why not sell people a lifetime of renting instead?When asked by Amy Sparling whether Exeter City Futures simply intends to gentrify Exeter and price the locals out of the market, Roli Martin again tried misdirection instead of providing a proper answer, inviting the meeting to think of better construction standards and public realm instead. And Karime Hassan variously tried to insist that the thousands of rented flats the scheme plans should be called “homes”, presumably for the same reason he calls bedsits “co-living”, bandied around talk of £1 billion investment pots and exhorted councillors to think big instead of worrying about the details.When these tactics didn’t work he resorted to scaremongering, citing fears of overflowing Exeter motorway junctions, or presenting a binary choice between Exeter City Futures’ plans and business as usual, as if nothing else is possible.While it is true that the national planning system is riddled with problems and routinely produces unwanted outcomes, no-one is explaining why Exeter should fix it on behalf of the government, or take on all the risks that would be entailed by doing so, as Exeter City Futures proposes. Nor is there any explanation of how the 42 other “garden community” schemes that are being developed around the country are coping without their own version of Exeter Development Fund to solve all their financing and site viability problems for them.It appears that Karime Hassan’s attachment to the scheme, while it may be motivated by many other considerations besides, is partly about the need to demonstrate the viability of the new Exeter Local Plan to the planning inspectorate next June. Whether Exeter should fulfil government housing targets is one thing, as they are based on population estimates that the ONS has since admitted were faulty, but the risks of putting all our spatial eggs into a single policy basket is another. These should be clear to all who witnessed the failure of the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan.The new Exeter Local Plan will guide development in the city until 2040A new Exeter Local Plan that is designed around Liveable Exeter and Exeter Development Fund could be a disaster for the city. And pending government planning reforms may change the situation so much that the new plan would need to be revisited anyway. But Exeter City Futures, with Karime Hassan at the helm, appears determined to press on with as much haste as possible, building out multiple sites simultaneouslyAt least Amy Sparling got a straight answer when she asked how any of this would help deliver the Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan (which, let’s not forget, is what Exeter City Futures is supposed to be doing and the reason given for sending Karime Hassan and another senior director to work there five days a week). Elaine Anning admitted that the fund isn’t designed for this purpose.Instead it would do no more than add somewhat less carbon to the city’s grubby greenhouse gas emissions account than building 12,000 houses would otherwise have done. But as Exeter City Futures has not assessed most of the emissions that these developments would generate it doesn’t know how much.Energy efficiency in use is its primary focus here. Operational emissions only constitute one third of the whole life cycle emissions of residential buildings, so we can be sure that the Liveable Exeter development scheme would still produce plenty. And well beyond 2030 too: it’s taken nearly five years to work up the fund so far and it’s still only at proof of concept stage.As Anne Jobson said, much of the fund proposition is still theoretical and provisional, the outline business case remains full of assumptions and projections, and even the executive summary leaves issues unclarified. Rob Hannaford agreed, pointing out that this was the fourth scrutiny meeting held on the subject without providing sufficient detail for scrutiny.Liberal Democrat Kevin Mitchell supported Rob Hannaford and Michael Mitchell’s views that third party critical input was required, rather than simply sales pitches. Both queried how much more time the council should spend on the fund if it wasn’t going to work, pointing at instability in central government and wondering whether it might not be time to move on.Labour councillor Paul Knott disagreed vehemently, although the substance of his comments could have been boiled down to “I’m new here, so I’m happy to be a completely uncritical cheerleader”. If the committee members had been a circus audience, no-one present would have been in any doubt that he was a plant.In apparently self-defeating desperation, Karime Hassan even sought to suggest that as Robert Jenrick had signed off on the idea before being sacked as secretary of state, it must have had significant merit.

Subscribe freeLabour chair Matt Vizard concluded the meeting by agreeing that a small group of councillors should subject the fund to greater scrutiny at the same time as Exeter City Futures continues work on its governance structures, models a pilot development site and continues to hard-sell the idea to the city’s other public bodies while trying to convince councillors to put Exeter’s assets where its money will be if it succeeds.Of course all of this was going to happen anyway, except the extra council scrutiny, because government is funding most of the work (although not the council’s senior staff salaries when they’re working for the company). It’s almost as if the Labour executive committee will press on regardless the moment it gets a chance to approve the plan without those annoying scrutiny councillors round the table.Meanwhile, the Public Accounts Committee, NAO and CIPFA have all raised concerns about Thurrock Council’s own £1 billion borrowing and investment scheme. These include lack of transparency, decision-making by very small groups of people, borrowing that is disproportionate to council resources and an over-reliance on commercial sensitivity as an excuse for limiting information disclosure.As barrister Leo Davidson put it: “If, as a local authority, your financial scheme depends on secrecy and cannot provide public scrutiny, it’s a pretty good clue that you’ve adopted the wrong strategy.”"

"content" : "It’s taken Devon County Council so long to put together a draft Exeter Local Cycling &amp;amp; Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP) that the government active travel investment strategy that requires it is already in the second year of its second four year phaseLast month county officers presented an Exeter LCWIP update to the Exeter Highways and Traffic Orders Committee (HaTOC) which monitors such matters at County Hall.Not only was this no more than a preamble to a consultation on the draft version of the plan, which the county council said would be held “over the summer and early autumn”, there is still no date set for the public consultation to take place.The county council’s soft-pedalling follows an Exeter LCWIP scoping report it produced in May 2021, four years after the government tasked the county council with producing the plan, which set a plan production timetable which is now twelve months behind schedule.It also produced a follow-up background report two months later, in response to which Exeter Cycling Campaign published a comprehensive analysis which identified a range of ways in which the county council’s efforts could be improved.However last month’s update confirms that striking deficiencies remain in the county council’s approach which include omitting several Exeter residential areas and failing to include routes which reach all of the city’s schools.You wouldn’t know it from the HaTOC meeting minutes, but Green Party councillor Amy Sparling raised these issues and more, including the plan’s insufficiency to support 50% of Exeter trips being made on foot or by bike, a target set by the county council’s own Exeter Transport Strategy.E3 cycle route Chard Road modal filterAnd the Exeter LCWIP still has to travel through several more stages before finally being signed off by the county council, which has not set a date for this either. It says it will then be embedded in key strategic documents including the new Exeter Local Plan, in line with Department for Transport guidance.However when Mike Walton of Exeter Cycling Campaign asked Exeter City Council to confirm that it would incorporate the Exeter LCWIP in the new Exeter Local Plan at its July meeting, Labour councillor Emma Morse said it would not, on the basis that the procedures for producing the two policies were inconsistent.Apart from implying that the Department for Transport should change its national guidance to conform with Exeter City Council’s considered view of the matter, the council also sought to hide behind changes to the national planning policy framework which are being introduced by the government’s Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill.The bill only reached committee stage at the end of June, with amendments yet to be confirmed, and will not pass this stage until after the city council has signed off on its draft local plan for consultation.For a second-tier council that is not a local transport authority to overrule Department for Transport guidance on the grounds that it knows what a government bill will or will not contain by the time it becomes law in 2023 is putting the cart before the horse.

Either way, however much it drags its heels it doesn’t look like the county council can keep delivering cycling infrastructure that doesn’t meet the standards outlined in the government’s Gear Change strategy, as it intends to do at Magdalen Road, for much longer.Active Travel England will formally become a government executive agency later this year, when it will become responsible for assessing all applications from local transport authorities, including Devon County Council, for active travel funding.It will only fund schemes which meet LTN 1/20 cycle infrastructure design standards and will also inspect schemes that have already been funded to ensure they meet these standards.Exeter can expect to be passed over for future active travel funding without an LCWIP which meets these standards."

"content" : "After fronting a pair of Liveable Exeter property development scheme promotional events in an empty High Street retail unit in May and June, it was RAMM’s turn to host a third at its Queen Street museum headquarters in July.Ostensibly Lego-led, all three events have sought to convey the idea that the council is keen to invite residents to have their say on how the new Exeter Local Plan should frame spatial development in the city until 2040.Touted as a “once in a generation opportunity to reimagine what the city could look like” much of the thinking around the 12,000 homes the council is determined to build whether or not Exeter needs them has nevertheless already been done.As council development director Ian Collinson recently said, the council intends the Liveable Exeter scheme to “anchor and underpin” the new local plan, and the scheme’s financing vehicle, Exeter Development Fund, depends in turn on a series of assumptions that have already been made about what Liveable Exeter development should be and whose interests it should serve.These include that all the housing should be for rent, not purchase, in order to extract sufficient profit to pay the interest demanded by bankrolling private financiers, and that few units will be suitable for family occupation with none for social housing.Central government, which is paying Exeter City Futures to engineer the fund, will retain effective control throughout, and the council will have to sell publicly-owned land and property assets to a third-party development corporation to make it happen.Liveable Exeter community engagement with council development director Ian CollinsonLast month’s RAMM event showcased the council’s approach to the community participation in local plan development it needs to demonstrate to get the plan past the planning inspectorate.The audience was presented with a demo of an online-only “Future Place” survey which invited participants to choose between prescribed options presented as vague abstractions rather than concrete proposals.None addressed the development delivery financing priorities which look set to turn the Liveable Exeter scheme into a gentrification engine.Answers that were allowed to “Which is most important for the future of this place?” included “Streets for living, playing and relaxing: not just for travel” and “A vibrant neighbourhood: all the things I require nearby”. None related to affordability or prioritising housing for local people.Nor was there an explanation of how the findings derived from non-statutory consultation approaches such as this, or the Lego models and post-it notes which were the primary input methods at the “RAMM About Town” events that took place in May and June, will actually be incorporated into the new plan.The council has so far failed to answer questions about how this might work, but does say it will “consider” what it calls “feedback”.Council planning policy promotion as museum exhibit – “Picture yourself in the leafy green, sustainable Exeter of the future”Apart from council members and officers, it appeared few present were convinced by the “Future Place” survey demo.While the choice of tools had clearly shaped its design, there was no escaping the contention that its content should have been derived differently. By actually talking to people first, as several suggested.However as the survey was due to go live the same week, the prospects for pre-launch community consultation looked poor, particularly as its findings are supposed to be included in the draft plan which is due in September.(As there’s still no sign of the survey a fortnight later, who knows what role it will now play.)Audience members also mentioned the poor quality of recent Exeter development in areas including Monkerton and Newcourt and pointed out that what’s needed to make places work for residents is already well-understood.The council’s stock rejoinder to this sort of criticism has become to blame the planning system, repeatedly, then cite Exeter Development Fund as the solution.Not that the contradiction entailed by encouraging people to get involved in developing new planning policy while telling them that planning policy doesn’t work is entirely lost on all those involved.

However it is not the fault of the planning system that the council has not introduced promised policies to restrict the impact of inexorably rising student numbers on the city’s residential housing stock, or to prevent developers pretending that enormous blocks of sub-standard bedsits are not intended for student occupation simply by calling them “co-living”.Nor is the planning system responsible for the council not setting higher standards than the national Building Regulations for energy efficiency or introducing other improved design quality standards.Instead the council has been postponing the introduction of needed new planning policies for the past two years on the grounds the new local plan is on its way, although its adoption will not take place until June 2024 at the earliest.It appears it has become so fixated on delivering the Liveable Exeter scheme, and lining up Exeter Development Fund to finance it, that it is prepared to let developers carry on regardless in the rest of the city while it spends years putting together its plans for a handful of sites.Whether the planning system reforms the government intends to introduce as part of its Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill, which is expected to become law before Exeter’s new local plan reaches examination stage, will lay the council’s carefully-contrived plans to waste remains to be seen."

"content" : "It would be difficult to find any regular Exeter bus user who would disagree that “the bus service in Exeter and its travel to work area is currently not fit for purpose”.This stark statement was made by Exeter Labour councillors at a special meeting of Devon County Council’s Exeter Highways and Traffic Orders Committee (HaTOC) held in April in response to the state of the city’s bus services.They said the issue was coming up frequently on the doorstep during canvassing for the May local elections, and called for bus franchising powers to be included in any future county devolution deal and for better marketing of services to improve patronage.Mike Watson, the managing director of Stagecoach South West, Exeter’s principal bus services provider, told the committee that he greatly regretted where things stood.Councillor Rob Hannaford, then leader of the Labour group on the county council, concluded a litany of shortcomings by paraphrasing Edward VIII’s reaction when confronted by poverty and hardship in the Welsh valleys in the 1930s, saying: “Something must be done”.As nothing very much was actually done by the abdicating king or anyone else until a Labour government was elected nine years later, his choice of words may have been unintentionally apt.The county council cabinet noted the committee’s resolution at its May meeting and requested a full officer report on the issue.The report, published earlier this month, does not give grounds for optimism. The evidence suggests that a step change in improving bus services will stay in the “too difficult” tray for the foreseeable future.The plansIn March 2021 the government published a new national bus strategy: Bus Back Better. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, in the foreword: “As we build back from the pandemic, better buses will be one of our major acts of levelling-up”.He added: “Last year, we announced £3 billion of new funding to level up buses across England towards London standards. This strategy describes how we will use that money.“Just as we already have in the capital, we want main road services in cities and towns to run so often that you don’t need a timetable.”The strategy says its central aim is “to get more people travelling by bus” which it says it will achieve only “if we can make buses a practical and attractive alternative to the car for more people”.It says it will “make buses more frequent, more reliable, easier to understand and use, better co-ordinated and cheaper: in other words, more like London’s, where these type of improvements dramatically increased passenger numbers, reduced congestion, carbon and pollution, helped the disadvantaged and got motorists out of their cars.”It also says: “We want services that keep running into the evenings and at weekends.”Stagecoach Exwick service – one Exeter route that still runs in the evening and at weekends, but won’t run at night from 31 JulyHowever even £3 billion is not enough to achieve this step change right across the country.Hence the requirement that all local transport authorities submit bus service improvement plans to set out how each would deliver improvements in line with the requirements of the national strategy, for the government to decide which plans to fund and by how much.Devon County Council, Exeter’s local transport authority, published its bus services improvement plan last October. Its main proposals are:  Improvements to frequency of weekday rural services and of inter-urban services (including evenings and Sundays) as well as hourly night buses on key routes  Exploring the use of Demand-Responsive Transport (DRT)  Bus priority measures in traffic management  Better information for passengers  Reduced fares through new types of zonal tickets  Uniform “Devon Bus” branding  Targets for zero-emission buses  A passengers’ charter.Its overall aim is to drive up bus service usage, though none of its proposals is particularly radical. Its ideas about DRT look behind the times beside, for example, Essex County Council’s successful bid to the government’s Rural Mobility Fund for a Digital DRT scheme trial.Stagecoach Tiverton/Cullompton/Exeter service – rural bus services are also importantThe county council estimated the annual cost of delivering its bus services improvement plan would be £33.6 million.The government published its response to local transport authority plans in April in a press release which opened with a misleading headline: “Cheaper and better buses in £7 billion package to level up transport outside London”.In fact most of the £7 billion is going to other local transport schemes, including £5.7 billion to City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements.A total of just £1.08 billion was allocated to bus services improvement plans, far less than the £3 billion originally promised.Of the 79 authorities that submitted bids only 31 received any funding at all. Devon County Council received £14.1 million for a three-year period, £86.7 million less than it asked for.It received less than half of the average £35 million allocation, putting it in 21st place among the authorities that did receive funding, and it was fourth from the bottom of the per capita list, receiving £17 per head against an average of £60.Councillor Andrea Davis, the county council cabinet member for climate change, environment and transport, expressed strong disappointment at the decision and said the funding gap was so large that the Devon bus services improvement plan could not be delivered.The county council has since submitted a revised proposal on which it intends to consult in October, when it will also update its plan.The realityThe County Councils Network published an analysis of the situation in April which identified a “perfect storm” of factors impacting on the recovery of bus services across the country.Fuel price increases have put operators “on the edge of affordability to carry out any bus services, let alone those that were already marginal”, the minimum wage for staff increased in April and pandemic-related government financial support ends in October.Passenger numbers also remain low, having still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, with some rural areas at less than half their previous rates.There are driver shortages across the country and “concern that this will continue to be an issue given the recent campaign of recruitment for HGV drivers”, which may be a more attractive employment option because it does not involve dealing with passengers.Meanwhile delays at DVLA mean it currently takes fifteen weeks to recruit and train a bus driver.Greenslades Exeter G service – Stagecoach is not the only playerIn addition, Stagecoach South West is struggling with acute local difficulties that particularly affect Exeter.Mike Watson said in April that the company had reduced its driver shortage from 100 to 55, but all those vacancies were in Exeter, which he blamed partly on high housing costs in the city.The company has reduced the number of evening and weekend shifts, as they are generally unpopular with drivers, but this reduces services, which is unpopular with passengers.There is also considerable anecdotal evidence of the company having industrial relations problems, which apparently include an excessively disciplinary approach to drivers following passenger complaints.When Councillor Marina Asvachin suggested this was an issue at April’s special HaTOC meeting, Stagecoach South West Managing Director Mike Watson did not respond.There are also issues with Exeter’s route network, which has not kept up with changing needs and opportunities. Mike Watson told us that he saw the need for changes, but that the county council was not supportive.This is borne out by the absence of references to network changes in the Devon bus services improvement plan, although officers told this month’s county council cabinet meeting that they would review the network over the next six months.Dartline Cullompton service – Devon’s bus network needs to cover dozens of smaller towns and villagesThe overall message from Stagecoach is: we know there are problems, we have plans to solve them and we are working hard to deliver them. Meanwhile, please bear with us.The detail underlying that message does tend to get overlooked, however, when service delivery often fails passengers and customer relations make things worse.One frustrated Exeter resident recently tweeted: “One bus an hour. On a key city route. At peak commuter time on a Friday. When there used to be a bus every twelve minutes. You are totally failing passengers.”Stagecoach responded: “Like the rest of the UK we’re short staffed at the moment. We’re working hard to get this sorted and return to normal as soon as possible. As a result we are unable to operate some of the buses across our network. Thanks.”What about a bit of serious explanation instead of this tired old saw that has been in use for at least a year now?The implicationsThe state of bus services is only one aspect of a bigger crisis in local transport and mobility which will remain with us even after Exeter bus services have been restored to an acceptable level.Getting people out of private cars is a key carbon emissions reduction policy. Cars are not only a carbon problem: recent research shows that tyre wear produces much higher levels of particle pollution than exhaust emissions.And there are numerous other problems with simply switching to electric vehicles, not least that we cannot currently access sufficient power to charge them.Devon County Council finalised its 2020-30 Exeter Transport Strategy in November 2020, after the pandemic had begun but before its longer-term impact on travel patterns had become clear.The strategy has a target that half of trips within the city should be made on foot or by bike, which is hardly more than when the strategy was written, but fails to specify what the modal distribution of the other half should be: bus, train or private car?View from a bus stuck in Exeter traffic at a busy junction without priority lanesNor does the strategy have anything innovative to say about inbound travel from outside the city, particularly for the 90% of rural residents who access Exeter by car.More Park &amp;amp; Ride sites are suggested, despite their many downsides including the fact that without bus priority measures Park &amp;amp; Ride buses are still caught in city traffic.The strategy also contains passing references to rail and the “Devon Metro” scheme, but these are vague.It presents “integrated transport” as a good thing but proposes no specific changes apart from multi-modal ticketing, for which the rail companies show no enthusiasm according to Mike Watson.In this respect the Devon bus services improvement plan may be a distraction, focussing as it does on one transport mode. The section on better integration with rail services is about little more than better signage at stations and improved websites and waiting facilities.It does at least record some improvements in bus connections with trains arriving late at night from London.Stagecoach has changed its timetables twice in four months – April and July 2022Meanwhile there is broad consensus, identified in the House of Commons Transport Committee report on bus services outside London, that convenience and frequency are major factors in decisions about what form of transport people will take.The Devon bus services improvement plan went some way to confronting these issues, and the county council sees restoring confidence in bus services as key to increasing their use. Yet its ability to achieve this is in question.Stagecoach has withdrawn, or has announced it will withdraw, from several bus services operated under contract to the county council, which has been unable to find other operators to take them on. These include Exeter’s night buses.Despite amended timetables from April, unreliable service delivery has continued into July. The daily list of cancellations on the Stagecoach website is substantial.The Stagecoach app, promoted by the company as the way to find out where your bus is, failed on the Thursday and Friday of the Jubilee holiday weekend. The company has not responded to a request for an explanation.The county council said that it would use some of the government bus services improvement funding to develop a county-wide app covering all bus services without the flaws in the Stagecoach product, but it is not clear when this be ready for use.Stagecoach app showing Exeter bus service delays and cancellationsAt the same time the county council, as highway authority, has done remarkably little to introduce new bus priority measures in Exeter that are needed to improve services.For example, traffic light settings take no apparent account of bus movement, some bus priority lanes are mornings only and there have been no proposals to revise Exeter traffic flows for many years.In addition, the increased use of cards and smartphones for fare payment has improved punctuality but requiring passengers without passes or cards to purchase tickets before boarding, either from pavement machines, local shops or online would improve it further.The Devon bus services improvement plan does promise to address this situation, and £8.8 million of the £14.1 million funding the county council received must be used for improving bus priority measures.Whether the members of Exeter HaTOC will consider the county council’s response to the situation fit for purpose remains to be seen.The futureAs things stand weary passengers still wait daily for over an hour for their buses and relations between Stagecoach and the county council have taken a turn for the worse.At this month’s county council cabinet meeting Andrea Davis complained that the county council was being forced to respond to complaints about bus services because Stagecoach was failing to do so.She also said that it had issues with Stagecoach (which she did not specify) that it did not have with any other bus operator, and that the situation was getting worse with no end in sight.It has also emerged that, after writing to the regional traffic commissioner to complain about the company, an inquiry was held into Stagecoach South West’s competence and performance at the end of last month. The commissioner’s report is pending.Stagecoach Tiverton - Cullompton - Exeter service collecting passengers in Sidwell StreetWe asked Mike Watson to comment. He said: “We have worked closely with Devon County Council and kept them informed every step of the way through our current staffing issues.“We have shared with them our plans for recovery and whilst I am disappointed that they have written their letter, I completely understand their position and their need to do so.“We remain focused on our recovery plans and you will see a marked improvement in our service performance over August as we envisage lost mileage to be largely eradicated over the summer.“We have also put in plans to make sure this is sustained by giving our staff a 10% pay increase to reduce staff leaving and encourage more new people to join us.“We fully expect our plans to yield good results and I can now see the light at the end of the tunnel.”Campaign sticker on Exeter bus shelter during 2021 Stagecoach strike over pay and working conditionsFurther service cuts, which will hardly encourage more people onto buses, are nevertheless expected later this year.Even Mike Watson’s optimism that services will improve must be tempered against his baseline measure: the currently reduced timetables which will be further reduced next week.Waiting even 30 minutes for an urban bus is too long for it to become the preferred means of transport.We do not have services which “run so often that you don’t need a timetable” in Exeter, although we no longer have printed timetables. Stagecoach has stopped printing them and the county council’s timetable booklets only cover the district council areas outside the city.

As ever, the root problem is money. According to its latest annual report Stagecoach South West’s pre-tax profits for 2020-21 were £1.95 million compared to £1.06 million in 2019-20, despite a pandemic-related fall in its 2020-21 revenue by one-third from the previous year.This was achieved by reducing non-mileage related costs. The higher cost pressures this year will leave Stagecoach little room for manoeuvre.Devon County Council is also cash-strapped. The county treasurer has warned of a 2022-23 overspend exceeding £40 million.And central government is unlikely to make funding available on the scale required: both contenders to be the next prime minister favour cuts over spending.Like Welsh miners in the 1930’s, it seems Exeter HaTOC will have to wait for the election of a Labour government to begin delivering the public transport system Exeter needs."

"content" : "Exeter City Futures used to say that its mission was to “make Exeter energy independent and congestion free by 2025”, an aim it intended to achieve within the decade following its 2015 launch.The city council began financing the company to this end in 2016, then decided to make it responsible for delivering Exeter decarbonisation in 2019, when it declared a climate emergency and commissioned the company to perform a full baseline audit of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions, identify how Exeter could “achieve zero carbon” and produce a plan to deliver it.Six months later Exeter City Futures admitted that it did not have the “resource capacity” to perform a city greenhouse gas emissions audit. The company nevertheless continued work on its Net Zero Exeter plan without an emissions audit on which to base it.The council said and did nothing about this.The resulting plan proposes a collection of vaguely-defined activities, very few of which are accompanied by quantified emissions reductions projections. Those that are only account for 329,000 tonnes of annual Exeter greenhouse gas emissions.The council nevertheless adopted it in July 2020 and the Liveable Exeter Place Board followed suit on behalf of dozens of organisations.Two months earlier, however, Exeter City Futures had privately commissioned engineering consultants WSP to review the plan. The firm found it had numerous inconsistencies and flaws.WSP’s unsurprising primary recommendation was that a baseline audit of Exeter’s greenhouse gas emissions should be performed.It also found that the plan’s emissions reductions figures needed “recalculating”, that it needed an “underlying model of reality” and that “clarity would be useful” on why its goals had been chosen.Exeter City Futures promised to update the Net Zero Exeter plan by December 2020, three months after the WSP review was completed, then update it annually thereafter, but it remains unchanged since its publication more than two years ago.The council finally revisited the issue last December after Exeter Green Party renewed its calls for a city carbon budget which specified meaningful annual emissions reductions based on a properly calculated baseline audit.The council resolved, for the second time, to “establish a carbon budget for the city of Exeter to show the baseline position for the city, the various city sectors who [sic] contribute to carbon emissions [and] the targets to achieve net zero”.But when the council finally published the long-overdue Exeter greenhouse gas emissions baseline inventory last month, produced by a specialist University of Exeter team, it only accounted for scope one and two territorial emissions, effectively ensuring Exeter will not meet its net zero targets.An unnamed council officer had secretly decided to exclude scope three emissions from the inventory despite neither of the decisions taken by councillors mentioning any such exclusion.When we asked the council to explain this decision it refused to say who had taken it and claimed that “there was no intention to include scope three emissions in this particular commission”.City council chief executive Karime Hassan nevertheless subsequently claimed that the university study “quantified the reductions required to achieve net zero by 2030”.He also asserted the viability of the Net Zero Exeter plan as well as the central role of Exeter City Futures, a private company of which he is also chief executive, in delivering it.Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities – sources and boundaries of city greenhouse gas emissionsNone of this sorry history, or the millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions the city has generated while it has been unfolding, has deterred the council and its partners from indulging in a series of overconfident climate leadership claims.In 2020 Labour councillor Rachel Sutton, then council net zero lead, said Exeter is “in the vanguard of this nationwide challenge”.In 2021 the council repeatedly claimed that the Net Zero Exeter plan provides “a clear roadmap to carbon neutrality” and “sets out what Exeter will need to put in place in order to be net zero carbon by 2030”.Earlier this year Labour’s local election campaign leaflets said Exeter is “an exemplar city in the UK for carbon reduction” which is “leading the way on climate change and the green agenda”.And last month Labour councillor Duncan Wood, who is now responsible for the city’s response to the climate crisis, claimed that “Exeter is well known for leading the way” in emissions reduction.However, within the limits imposed by the council’s decision to restrict it to scope one and two emissions, the university Exeter greenhouse gas inventory confirms the redundancy of the Exeter City Futures Net Zero Exeter plan.The plan doesn’t just fail to address Exeter’s scope three emissions: recognised greenhouse gas emissions inventory methodologies are nowhere in sight.Many of the figures it does include are derived using ad hoc methods which produce major miscalculations, including the use of incorrect gas and electricity emissions factors and erroneous cost and impact assumptions.These vary significantly from the estimates and targets calculated by the university team, which are based on the government’s legally-binding Sixth Carbon Budget.Four of 26 Net Zero Exeter plan “priority actions” showing emissions savings miscalculations and erroneous cost assumptionsFor example, the Net Zero Exeter plan only addresses around 68,000 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) of Exeter emissions from all its transport actions put together. The university study accounts for 106,000 tCO2e of emissions from this source.At the same time the plan addresses just 1,200 tCO2e of Exeter emissions from waste. The university study accounts for 33,500 tCO2e of emissions from domestic waste alone.Government figures for both these emissions sources are readily available. Exeter’s performance has hardly changed over many years.The Net Zero Exeter plan claims its emissions reductions figures are for 2031. As the university study accounts for Exeter’s territorial emissions from 2019 and does not include any of the city’s planned 12,000 new homes or the 22% population increase that will accompany them, the gaps between its estimates and the plan figures are much wider still.The plan ignores entire emissions sectors altogether, fails to distinguish between energy sources and uses, includes no account of emissions reductions trajectories or expected grid emissions changes and provides neither emissions accounting mechanisms nor annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.Exeter City Futures website - vision &amp;amp; mission summaryMr Hassan did appear to acknowledge that the Net Zero Exeter plan does not fulfil its billing at a meeting of scrutiny councillors held last month to discuss the university study.He said: “There’s a big difference between a road map and an action plan that defines the resources, when and how you’re going to do it.”Exeter City Futures nevertheless ignored the gulf between its plan and the university study in a subsequent statement in which it said that the latter would “guide our actions over the next eight years as we support the city to their [sic] aim of carbon neutrality for 2030”.The plan’s numerous shortcomings and its incompatibility with the university study cannot simply be glossed over. If the latter is to be taken seriously then the former cannot also be.The role of Exeter City Futures - Exeter City Council strategic scrutiny committee presentationDespite these failings Mr Hassan emphasised the “thought leadership” role he said Exeter City Futures had played in the city since 2016.He said that Met Office and University of Exeter expertise in environmental intelligence and climate science had been the city’s USP and key to the regional narrative since 2018.He also cited a “strong culture of collaboration in the city” which he said had been facilitated by the Liveable Exeter Place Board, which first met in 2019.He did not explain the role of thought leadership, expertise and collaboration in the university study’s finding that Exeter emissions reductions to date had resulted largely from national electricity grid supply changes, rather than changes made locally.He nevertheless claimed, in a revisionist history of Exeter City Futures included in his report to councillors, that “the transition to a low carbon future for Exeter has been solid”.By the end of this year the council will have spent £500,000 of public money supporting the company, and has had to allocate another £120,000 to the cost of emissions calculations by the university team.All the city has to show for it, three years late, are incomplete decarbonisation targets without delivery policies or plans.It is difficult to imagine a context in which delivering so little over so long at such public expense could justify continuing as before, particularly when racing against a clock that counts accumulating emissions as well as time passing.Mr Hassan even acknowledged that Exeter City Futures remains unable to deliver, saying: “If the role of Exeter City Futures is defined as a change agent, a vehicle for the city’s organisations to keep a focus on the challenge and to align and co-ordinate activities towards a net zero goal then the capacity of the team is insufficient to meet the task”.He nevertheless also said the company “can continue to perform an effective role in moving the agenda forward, but in an opportunistic way rather than as supporting a programme designed to meet defined targets.”This bizarre proposition appears to deny the basis on which UK law requires decarbonisation to proceed.It also seems to be his justification for proposing that the council should continue to rely on Exeter City Futures to provide ways and means for Exeter to meet its net zero 2030 target, which he described as inviting the company “to reflect on the challenges of resourcing the step change in activity to meet the net zero 2030 goal and to suggest options for meeting these challenges”.He subsequently suggested that the company would need additional financial support, which he described as “an enhanced resource commensurate to the challenge in hand”.Nothing was said about possible conflicts of interest arising around Mr Hassan’s proposal as council chief executive for the council to commission the services of a private company of which he is also chief executive, nor about his participation in scrutiny and executive decision-making meetings which directly addressed the company’s role.If Mr Hassan and another senior council director really have been working on Net Zero Exeter plan delivery since they were sent to work at the company in January, which was the primary reason given for sending them there, why might it sill be incapable of fulfilling this purpose?When Mr Hassan proposed that the council support the company in 2015 it expected to achieve its aims “through the use of pioneering technology and data analytics” while also “promoting business growth and increased investment”.It appears that these theory of change assumptions remain unexamined: at the meeting he reasserted the role of research-intensive technocratic decarbonisation “innovations” that require significant investment and development lead time.Low cost, low tech approaches to emissions reduction that simply involve cutting resource consumption are not on the agenda, despite the success of many such initiatives in cities elsewhere, apparently because the council and its partners will not pursue non-profit options.Yet the case for an approach that seeks to support what the chief executive misguidedly describes as “green growth” is becoming weaker every day.To take just one issue, the scale of household and organisational spending as well as infrastructure investment required to replace our existing combustion engine transport system like for like with electric motor-powered mobility is enormous.We are nowhere near able to make this transition, let alone embark on it at the rate that would be necessary to decarbonise by 2050, never mind 2030.Not only is demand for electric vehicles already outstripping supply because of materials shortages which are likely to become more acute, electricity distribution grid constraints prevent their widespread use in Exeter.There is currently little prospect of these barriers being addressed by private or public sectors.Meanwhile the university study confirms that lower levels of vehicle use supported by the introduction of a strict clean air zone are likely to be the most effective way of reducing these emissions.And it is becoming increasingly clear that continuing to prioritise private vehicle use of urban space, given the many other changes we also need to make in towns and cities, would be self-defeating.But Mr Hassan’s comments at last month’s council meeting strongly suggest that he has only recently begun to grasp the scale of change that is needed, even while ignoring Exeter’s imported emissions, and not yet how to enable it.He said: “Every sector has technical, financial and political issues that we need to get into the detail of in order to understand how you go about doing this. Obviously that’s what I’m trying to get my head around with Exeter City Futures.”He also said: “The pace of change, I think, is a thing that really does hit home to me. It’s not about what we’ve been doing, it’s on another level.“I need to get my head around it from Exeter City Futures’ point of view as well, the messages Exeter City Futures needs to deliver on this.”It should not be news to him, for example, that “a step change in cycling and significant reduction in car usage” is required.And yet the council’s continuing commitment to spending nearly £20 million to keep the city’s multi-storey car parks in use for another 40 years suggests that it is."

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s response to the climate crisis has so far been characterised by numerous failings. It has failed to question flawed assumptions and appears determined to keep going down a road that has already demonstrably failed to deliver.Unfortunately its attitude towards accountability for its actions in this area is also cause for concern.Last month’s meeting of scrutiny councillors voted to establish a permanent committee called a “standing overview group” to oversee Exeter net zero delivery.Labour chair Rob Hannaford emphasised the importance and value of this ongoing formal monitoring mechanism, the creation of which had been suggested by Green councillor Tess Read.He proposed the motion himself, which was seconded by Conservative councillor Andrew Leadbetter.Rob Hannaford and Karime Hassan at the city council’s June strategic scrutiny committee meetingBut when council CEO Karime Hassan subsequently reported to the council’s executive committee, he omitted to mention the vote, instead saying: “Members called for an ongoing role in looking at the body of work and would seek to make this point to the scrutiny programme board”.(Like other council bodies, this board meets in private without publishing its decisions, which it refers to the council’s strategic management board on which Mr Hassan sits.)Not only is this not what the meeting of scrutiny councillors decided, it appears to frustrate their legal powers to act as a “check and balance on the executive”.These are the same powers the council denied to scrutiny councillors when it controversially, and apparently unlawfully, decided to send Mr Hassan and another senior director to work for Exeter City Futures.Mr Hassan’s report to the executive also failed to mention Councillor Read’s request for an Exeter greenhouse gas emissions monitoring report to be published annually so the city’s decarbonisation progress could be better understood.In a written response, which was not published until several weeks after the meeting was held, he said doing so would have “resourcing implications”. He also said that Exeter City Futures does not have the capacity to do this, adding to the lengthening list of the company’s limitations as a decarbonisation delivery vehicle.

At the same time Mr Hassan inserted several recommendations into his report that he had not mentioned at the meeting of scrutiny councillors.One was for the council to make an “immediate and concerted effort” to concentrate on the delivery of a new district heat network despite acknowledging elsewhere in his report that “many hundreds of thousands of pounds” had been spent on failed attempts to implement such networks in the city centre and at the South West Exeter extension.Another was to “invite Exeter City Futures to reflect on the challenges of resourcing the step change in activity to meet the net zero 2030 goal and to suggest options for meeting these challenges”, a proposal he said was particularly important, suggesting that the company would need “an enhanced resource commensurate to the challenge in hand”.There were several more. Nothing was said about possible conflicts of interest arising around Mr Hassan’s proposal as council chief executive for the council to commission the services of a private company of which he is also chief executive.Nor was anything said about his participation in scrutiny and executive decision-making meetings which directly addressed the company’s role.The executive committee also noted, without comment, that Mr Hassan, who was until recently both CEO and a director of both Exeter City Council and Exeter City Futures, had unilaterally decided to appoint Labour councillor Zion Lights to the company’s board using powers he acquired in February 2016 which have not been examined since."

"content" : "A report by city council chief executive Karime Hassan on an Exeter greenhouse gas emissions inventory by the University of Exeter has disregarded hundreds of thousands of tonnes of emissions that are driven every year by the actions of the city’s residents, businesses and visitors.The council-commissioned study also confirmed that Exeter emissions reductions to date have resulted largely from national electricity grid supply changes and not the actions of the city or county councils.It found that Exeter is overshooting emissions targets for transport by 400% and buildings by 600%, and that much greater reductions are immediately required which will nevertheless see the city continue to generate millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.The study specifies actions that would address the territorial emissions for which it accounts. But it does not account for the emissions that will result from the additional 12,000 homes that the council wants to build which will increase Exeter’s population by around 22% over the next twenty years.Nor does it account for emissions that are imported by Exeter’s residents, businesses and visitors which are likely to be much higher than its territorial emissions.This omission is not the result of ignorance: the council also commissioned a greenhouse gas emissions inventory from the same University of Exeter team to use in its own corporate carbon reporting which includes the emissions that were excluded from the city-wide inventory.More than two-thirds of the city council’s corporate emissions occur under this emissions scope.There are several approaches to greenhouse gas emissions accounting in use. Each yields different estimates using different methodologies based on different data sets. Efforts to improve their accuracy are ongoing.The UK government uses three principal official measures to fulfil a range of international agreements and for domestic policy-making purposes.BEIS territorial estimates include emissions produced within the UK’s borders while ONS residence estimates cover emissions by UK residents and UK-registered businesses whether in the UK or overseas. DEFRA carbon footprint estimates account for the emissions of all goods and services consumed in the UK wherever they are produced in the world.A comprehensive (and globally just) approach to calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of a given population or geography requires the use of a methodology which accounts not only for emissions produced within that territory but also emissions that are imported, as well as exported.The DEFRA carbon footprint estimates follow this approach. They account for emissions in the places where goods and services are consumed, rather than the (usually many) places that respond to that demand by supplying the goods or services in which emissions are embedded.As a result DEFRA carbon footprint estimates yield much higher figures for the emissions for which the UK is responsible than the BEIS territorial estimates, which produce the lowest.In 2016 the ONS estimated that 40% of the UK’s carbon footprint related to imported emissions while DEFRA found the proportion was 43% in 2019 and has since revised this upwards to nearly 48% in its most recent estimates, the methodology for which it now considers fully developed.As the DEFRA carbon footprint estimates are calculated for the whole country it is only possible to use them for smaller geographies on a broad per capita basis. Doing so yields an annual carbon footprint for Exeter of around 1.5 million tCO2e in 2019, the most recent year for which these figures are available.(To ensure they are reported on a consistent basis, greenhouse gas emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent - tCO2e - where each of the seven main greenhouse gases are weighted by their global warming potential.)This is about equal to the figure of 11.6 tCO2e per person per annum for Exeter that Exeter City Futures promoted last year (and well over a million tonnes a year more than the total of all projected carbon savings from the actions proposed by the company’s Net Zero Exeter plan).Calculating Exeter’s emissions using the 2019 BEIS territorial emissions estimates on the same broad per capita basis as the DEFRA figures yields a much lower annual carbon footprint for the city of around 900,000 tCO2e.However the distribution of territorial emissions around the UK differs widely. Small cities with low levels of carbon-intensive industrial and goods production activity, such as Exeter, are responsible for a much lower proportion of UK terrestrial emissions per capita than cities such as Swansea or Coventry which produce steel and cars for domestic use as well as export.Wealthy cities also typically import a higher proportion of their emissions than poorer cities because their residents have greater disposable incomes with which to buy goods and services that are typically produced elsewhere.As a result Exeter’s terrestrial emissions will be lower than the BEIS per capita UK average, while the proportion of its imported consumption emissions will be higher than the DEFRA per capita UK average.How much lower? After updating its methodology this year to include methane and nitrous oxide (but not fluorinated gases) in its local authority estimates BEIS said Exeter’s territorial greenhouse gas emissions were 488,000 tCO2e in 2019. Fluorinated gases would add around 29,000 tCO2e to make a total of around 517,000 tCO2e.How much higher? The DEFRA estimates for 2019 found that nearly 81% of the UK’s consumption emissions were accounted for by goods and services produced both in the UK and abroad.Unfortunately, calculating an accurate consumption-based carbon footprint for a sub-national geography such as Exeter using the approach which produced the DEFRA figures is not possible as it relies on national trade data, expressed in financial terms, to link flows of goods and services with the emissions generated by their production and distribution.So while we can be sure that Exeter produces some of the goods and services it consumes, we cannot be sure how much. As a result we can only use the DEFRA estimates to conclude that the proportion of the city’s consumption-driven greenhouse gas emissions which it imports in the form of goods and services could be as much as three quarters or more of the total.Nor are the BEIS terrestrial estimates directly comparable with the DEFRA consumption estimates. Exeter’s imported emissions cannot simply be added to its terrestrial emissions as this would not address emissions from the production of goods and services in the city that are exported for consumption elsewhere, among other issues.Production vs consumption based emissions by category from The Future Of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World, University of Leeds, ARUP &amp;amp; C40 CitiesHowever another approach is available which has developed from a method used for calculating corporate and organisational emissions which is the world’s most widely-used greenhouse gas accounting standard: the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.The Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories provides a robust methodology for community-scale carbon emission measurement.This methodology, also known as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities, divides emissions into three “scopes” and provides several reporting frameworks, the most comprehensive of which aligns with the IPCC national emissions reporting guidelines.Scope one covers emissions from sources inside the city boundary, scope two covers emissions resulting from the use of grid-supplied energy inside the city boundary and scope three covers all other emissions that occur outside the city boundary as a result of activities that take place within it.Emissions from the production of goods and services which are exported are accounted for in scope three of the place where they are consumed.Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities – sources and boundaries of city greenhouse gas emissionsThis methodology is the basis of the approach used by the University of Exeter Centre for Energy and the Environment to calculate emissions inventories for the members of a partnership of South West local authorities called the South West Energy and Environment Group (SWEEG).Exeter City Council and Devon County Council are both members: the Devon County Council-led Devon Climate Emergency project also relies on SWEEG inventories for the greenhouse gas emissions figures it uses as the basis for the Devon Carbon Plan (which it misleadingly calls “carbon footprints” on its website).However SWEEG emissions inventories do not fully adhere to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities methodology.A SWEEG methodology paper, which explains some of the differences, was supposed to accompany the Exeter greenhouse gas emissions inventory but the city council chief executive did not include it in his report.Instead of estimating emissions using bottom-up calculations based on the activities of people in a particular geography, which is the approach specified in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities methodology, SWEEG emissions inventories rely on BEIS local authority level emissions estimates for their inventory calculations to make them cheaper to produce.BEIS publishes these estimates two years in arrears so the Exeter inventory, the first draft of which was produced in 2021, was calculated on the basis of figures from 2019. These BEIS estimates only accounted for carbon dioxide emissions, so the university team used these as a basis on which to estimate other greenhouse gas emissions for that year.As the BEIS estimates entirely omit some sectors and gases the university also used other data as well as proxy sources to fill in some of the other gaps.Like the BEIS territorial emissions estimates on which they are based, SWEEG methodology estimates only cover greenhouse gas emissions in scopes one and two.(It is unclear whether the city council chief executive understands this: when asked by Green Party councillor Tess Read to clarify which emissions scopes were included in the Exeter inventory, he incorrectly replied that it only covered scope one).The city council claims this is because such emissions are “more in the control of people living, working and visiting the city”. However Exeter scope three emissions are also driven by the actions of people living in, working in and visiting the city, many of which are entirely in their control.Total life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of a range of passenger cars. Source: Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews under Creative Commons license.The Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities accounts for the emissions from fossil fuel burned by combustion engine-powered vehicles driven inside cities in scope one, but accounts for emissions generated in the discovery, extraction, refinement and transportation of the fuel in scope three (at least until the tanker carrying it enters the city).The emissions generated by the production of the car, including those embedded in the materials from which it is made as well as its disposal at the end of its life, all also fall in scope three unless any of those processes take place in the city.These emissions can be considerable, even for battery-powered electric cars.The situation with buildings is similar. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities accounts for emissions from fossil fuel burned in space and water heating and cooking in scope two, as it does those generated by the use of non-renewable electricity, when the energy is supplied via the distribution grid.However emissions which are embodied in the materials from which buildings are constructed and the emissions generated in their construction and demolition are accounted for in scope three, unless they are produced or disposed of in the same place they are used, while the emissions from energy required for these processes is only covered in scopes one and two to the extent it is consumed there.In the UK these emissions are greater than the emissions from the shipping and aviation sectors combined, while demolition often entails a much higher carbon footprint than re-use no matter how energy efficient the replacement structure.Construction carbon life-cycle. Image: University of Liverpool Zero Carbon Research Institute.There is no mention of scope three emissions related to transport and buildings in the city council chief executive’s report, nor any mention of emissions scopes at all.The university study refers just once to consumption-based carbon footprint measurement methods, in a footnote. But it neither explains the differences between this approach and the SWEEG methodology, nor the differences between the SWEEG methodology and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities reporting framework on which it is based.Nor does it explain that the council’s decision to restrict the scope of the study to territorial emissions produces partial decarbonisation targets which do not address Exeter’s imported scope three emissions, or mention that these could easily be at least as large again as the territorial emissions it covers.It does say that the SWEEG methodology “is consistent with the approach taken in UK national reporting”, which currently uses BEIS territorial estimates, but also makes clear that it relies throughout on the decarbonisation targets set in the UK’s national Sixth Carbon Budget.These targets include international shipping and aviation emissions which are largely accounted for in scope three.The SWEEG methodology also excludes shipping emissions even where they occur inside the city boundary.Exeter City Council is responsible for both the River Exe and Exeter Ship Canal to one mile out at sea, but the SWEEG methodology excludes emissions from these sources because of uncertainty about the data.And it excludes emissions from Exeter Airport, even for domestic flights, on the grounds that “there are questions as to where the boundary should be set for such emissions”.The Centre for Energy and the Environment team estimated that annual emissions from Exeter Airport passenger flights alone amounted to 173,000 tCO2e in 2017, then in 2020 estimated the airport’s total flight emissions to be around 200,000 tCO2e each year.Meanwhile the UK’s food supply generates more emissions abroad than it does at home, and it imports significant proportions of the cars and lorries, electrical and electronic devices, clothing and shoes, furniture and luggage, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, toys, jewellery and other goods that fuel its consumer economy.The SWEEG methodology excludes all the scope three emissions related to these goods, as it does the scope three emissions related to the provision of a wide range of commercial and consumer services ranging from corporate accounting software to streaming entertainment platforms.Tweet promoting Exeter Airport flights and parking by city council chief executive Karime Hassan with comments from Met Office &amp;amp; University of Exeter climate scientistsWhile greenhouse gas emissions inventories are simpler to calculate for organisations than cities, population-level emissions are not necessarily more difficult to estimate in scope three than in scopes one and two.Such estimates are inevitably imprecise, even in scopes one and two, not only because of challenges with accessibility to data and the scale and complexity of human settlements but also because of variations in methodology.The university team recently evaluated the differences between its SWEEG methodology and a bottom-up calculation which faithfully followed the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities methodology while producing an inventory commissioned by Cornwall Council.It found that its results differed by only a few per cent for most stationary combustion sources but varied by as much as 20% for on-road transportation emissions. These were lower when based on BEIS data (as per the SWEEG methodology) than they were when based on fuel sales (as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities methodology).Methodological challenges no more provide a justification for excluding scope three emissions from population-level greenhouse gas emissions estimates than they do for excluding scopes one or two. Especially in a city which likes to boast that it “houses more of the world’s top 100 climate scientists than anywhere else” and claims to aspire to global climate leadership.Nor do they mean we should allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good by excluding imprecise estimates from policy- and decision-making, especially when considering issues that will take decades to address and have existential import.Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard – scopes and emissionsExcluding scope three emissions from scopes-based emissions estimates isn’t only globally unjust, its methodological incoherence also produces perverse consequences at home.In the same way as Swansea should not alone shoulder the emissions burden from its steel industry or Coventry its car manufacturing, the residents of Cranbrook, its nearest settlement, can hardly be expected to take responsibility for the emissions generated by Exeter Airport.Yet the county council’s Devon Carbon Plan and the city council’s Exeter greenhouse gas inventory nevertheless both fail to account for them, ducking the issue of who should take responsibility for them.Disregarding hundreds of thousands of tonnes of annual emissions doesn’t just misrepresent the scale of Exeter’s impact: it produces partial decarbonisation targets which guarantees the city will fail to reach net zero by 2030.Worse still, it ignores the potential Exeter does have to reduce imported emissions, many of which are driven by consumption choices made by residents, businesses and visitors every day.There is low hanging as well as much harder to reach fruit in all emissions scopes. To disregard scope three is to ignore numerous opportunities to reduce our imported emissions whether or not government policy is to account for them.Climate Change Committee Sixth Carbon Budget – recommended pathAnd government policy is likely to move towards doing so, notwithstanding the scorched earth positions of several current Conservative Party leadership candidates.In its recent report to Parliament the UK’s statutory Climate Change Committee said: “Domestic decarbonisation should not lead to carbon leakage, but rather reduce both consumption and territorial emissions”.It also said: “We recommend that the UK aims to reduce its overseas consumption footprint as part of its contribution to reducing global emissions.”The committee isn’t expressing naive optimism about the direction of travel. Since the UK government’s claim to have set the “world’s most ambitious climate change target” by including international shipping and aviation in its carbon budget other countries have gone much further.Sweden has announced that it will include comprehensive consumption-based emissions in its national climate targets, which are to reach net zero by 2045, five years earlier than the UK.And Finland has set the world’s most ambitious climate target: to reach net zero by 2035 and net negative emissions (without relying on international offsetting) by 2040.

Emissions relating to these supply and value chains are particularly important to recognise as our behaviours drive these emissions even if we don’t produce them directly ourselves.”No doubt Exeter City Council’s executive would say that a Labour government would deliver decarbonisation where the Conservative government is failing to do so.It could take a step in that direction by including scope three emissions in the city’s greenhouse gas reduction targets and come clean on the scale of change that is actually needed to get anywhere near net zero at all."

Book your place via Eventbrite.St Sidwell’s Sidwella 19th century stained glass window detailSt Sidwell’s Community Centre, which opened in 2001, is an independent, entirely secular charity which welcomes everyone regardless of background, ability or circumstance and offers a range of activities, events and services for the local community.It runs a community café, a bakery and cookery school and free English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes.The centre also manages a large community garden, where events are held and organic fruit and vegetables are grown for use in the café, offers meeting rooms for hire to local groups and acts as a local heritage hub for Exeter city centre’s eastern quarter.There are volunteering and work experience opportunities across all areas of the centre’s work.St Sidwell’s Community Centre volunteers with Sidwella willow sculptureSidwella Day is celebrated in honour of the patron saint of Exeter and namesake of Sidwell Street.Sidwella, who is believed to have lived during the 6th century, is said to have been a modest, chaste, virginal, devout and courageous local lass. At least she was until a couple of farmworkers apparently killed her with a scythe.The truth of this is far from certain, since the story appears to have been sexed up by Bishop Grandisson in the 14th century. He introduced a wicked stepmother into the story, who paid the farmworkers to do the deed, and the miraculous creation of a water spring where she fell.Nothing is known about Sidwella’s taste in architecture and we can only imagine what she might have made of today’s Sidwell Street, including the current 1957-58 replacement for the original Saxon St Sidwell’s Church.It was designed by the same firm that bequeathed the city the nearby supermarket building.She might, however, have concluded that the 21st century was not beyond redemption if she visited today and discovered what goes on within the former church’s walls.

Its centrepiece is a stunning stained glass window by the Bideford artist James Paterson installed in 1958, juxtaposing the murder of Sidwella with the 1942 bombing of the previous 19th century church on the site.Sidwella is not a “saint” in the sense of having been canonised but rather a local “martyr” recognised by the local bishop, a practice which became so uncontrolled that in the 16th century the Catholic Church took over and centralised authority for canonisations in Rome.However she could instead be seen variously as a symbol for civil society (the transfer of most of the church building to the community centre), the natural environment (the nearby well spring water) and, through her secularisation, as an image for a wider community of all faiths and none."

None of the panel were Exeter constituency party members.It did not include Josie Parkhouse, who was elected to the city council in May, much to the dismay of many local party activists — apparently because she would have given Steve Race a run for his money from Labour’s green left.

As a result, diversity and inclusion trainer and ex-employment lawyer Helen Dallimore is the only shortlisted candidate who lives in Exeter, having moved back here ten years ago.She’s also the only shortlisted candidate not to have previously stood in a parliamentary election.Natasa Pantelic is currently a cabinet member on Slough Borough Council, where she has been a councillor for fourteen years. She polled just 1.6% of the vote to finish in fourth place in the 2021 Chesham and Amersham by-election.Neil Guild is a civil engineer, union convenor and former soldier who lives near Taunton, where he came fourth for Labour in the 2015 general election.And Steve Race, who we might call the continuity with change candidate, also came fourth for Labour in the 2015 general election in East Devon.He’s been a local councillor in London since 2018, where he was re-elected in May, and has a background in PR.Does this hint at his views on electoral reform? Perhaps not: a common criticism of proportional representation is that it can undermine the geographical connection between constituencies and their representatives in parliament."

New committee member Tess Read was among several councillors from across the political spectrum who ratcheted up the pressure on Exeter City Futures to properly explain its plans.Contradictions continue thick and fast. After repeatedly being told that the city’s public sector organisations would be in charge (or those which actually invest assets in the fund, which looks increasingly like being just the city council) it became clear that not only would they be outvoted on the fund’s board, all board appointments would be subject to ministerial approval too.Meanwhile Exeter City Futures still avoids voluntarily publishing its board minutes and reports despite promising scrutiny members it would do so. Perhaps the appointment of city councillor Zion Lights to the board, which quietly took place last week, will help it better discharge its information governance obligations?Only after being badgered by committee member Anne Jobson did the company publish the minutes of its March board meeting, more than three months late. But it still failed to include a report which was discussed at the meeting and has yet to publish anything about the board meeting it held at the beginning of June.The March meeting minutes nevertheless did include details of a presentation about a predominantly greenfield 60-acre business park development at Peamore in which Global City Futures, Exeter City Futures’ parent company, is involved.LDA Design, which is also helping Exeter City Futures pitch the fund, is involved in the development too.The ostensibly eco-friendly business park, which the meeting heard was “less than 10-15 minutes’ walk to the city centre” despite being four miles as the crow flies from the company’s Paris Street offices, unashamedly touts its “proximity to key arterial roads” at the intersection of the M5/A38 and A379.IRRATIONALE BY DESIGN?Exeter Digest #13 covered the first of two RAMM-hosted Liveable Exeter promotional events. The second, focussed on Exeter’s future as a “garden city”, took place a fortnight ago with the city council’s Director of City Development, Ian Collinson, topping the bill.Despite having been in post since April, and having overall responsibility for the development of the new Exeter Local Plan and the council’s property development schemes, Mr Collinson appears not to know that the city has more than a dozen significant employment sites in addition to the city centre, or that Exeter suffers from significant outbound, as well as inbound, commuting.He also seems to think that Exeter’s labour supply problems result from too few people living here, rather than its falling economic activity levels, and that other cities haven’t found solutions for the problems Exeter faces, despite many being far ahead on liveability and decarbonisation.Meanwhile the basic rationale for the Liveable Exeter-financing Exeter Development Fund — that the council’s planning policy and development control powers and its ownership of many of the scheme’s intended development sites are insufficient to ensure the delivery of low carbon design — continues to shed credibility.Not only has the government confirmed that local planning authorities are free to set higher standards than the national Building Regulations for energy efficiency, it has since extended these and other related design quality standards to include electric vehicle charging infrastructure.New detailed design codes are also on their way, which can be used to set stringent standards in much greater detail than planning policy documents.They can cover environmental and energy efficiency standards, walking and cycling infrastructure specifications and public realm requirements, among many other development delivery details, and are expected to come into force before the new Exeter Local Plan is adopted.TIK TOKThe county council-convened Devon Climate Emergency Response Group (DCERG) has continued its apparent commitment to avoiding public scrutiny of its decision-making by simultaneously publishing the minutes of six of its meetings (which are held in private without published agendas) at the end of May — despite some of these meetings being held in March.The DCERG’s minutes, when it does publish them, are not exactly full and frank accounts of what was said and done. This batch included references to new governance arrangements for the county carbon plan, which were explained at the meeting but omitted from the minutes, and a governance structure diagram that was discussed but nowhere to be seen.Given its determination to keep people in the dark, perhaps the DCERG should not be surprised that the public consultation on its response to the Devon Carbon Plan citizen’s assembly outputs received just 209 responses (from a population of 1.2 million), only ten of which were from organisations and only 2% of which were from people under 24 years old.

The 2022 edition considers digital news consumption in 46 markets covering half of the world’s population, based on a survey with more than 93,000 respondents, and explores trust in and engagement with journalism as well as audience polarisation and the ways young people access the news.Key UK findings this year include that news avoidance has almost doubled since 2016, with 46% now saying they avoid the news sometimes or often and many citing “too much news about politics and COVID-19” as a reason.Meanwhile overall trust in the news is down by 16% since the 2016 Brexit referendum amid increasingly polarised debates about politics and culture, although there are wide variations in trust levels between major brands with only 23% trusting The Daily Mail compared with 48% who trust The Guardian.The acquisition of Archant, one of the UK’s oldest regional publishers, by US-owned Newsquest in March this year has further consolidated local news ownership and raised concerns about quality.Newsquest has been accused of treating journalists like “battery hens” because of its page view targets, which most think unachievable, while Reach, which owns Devon Live, Exeter Express &amp;amp; Echo, Plymouth Herald and Western Morning News, uses a similar clickbait-prizing approach.Newsquest, Reach and National World now control almost 70% of all UK local newspaper circulation, with 700 titles between them of which Newsquest alone owns almost a third.SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT JOURNALISMThere are lots of ways you can help Exeter Observer to thrive:      Share this newsletter with your friends and family and encourage them to subscribe free.

"content" : "Research commissioned by Exeter City Council to underpin its post-pandemic approach to employment and skills has found a city beset by unaffordable housing, low graduate retention and economically inactive over 50’s.The research report, which largely relies on authoritative primary information sources for its findings, presents a much more realistic picture of Exeter’s economic viability than typical city council reports, which often selectively present outdated information or material from secondary or even tertiary sources.It has been used as a basis for a new Exeter employment and skills strategy.A summary provided for councillors by council officers mentions none of the key challenges identified in the research, so only those councillors who digest all 77 pages of the research report and strategy together would discover all the many inconvenient truths about Exeter’s economy that they contain.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            When the council’s executive committee met in May to discuss the strategy none of its members had anything to say about these challenges, although several extolled the quality of the research.Ruth Williams said: “I think it’s a brilliant report, the evidence base is just stunning. I’ve never seen anything so embedded in real, comprehensive, wide-ranging evidence.” Laura Wright also said it was “stunning” while Duncan Wood called the research “crucial”.The council’s chief executive Karime Hassan even claimed that the report highlighted how Exeter delivers “inclusive growth”.A meeting of the full council is due to examine the skills strategy next month. Which key challenges did the executive committee overlook?Housing affordabilityThe research found that Exeter house prices have increased by nearly 60% during the past ten years. Median house prices are now nearly ten times median earnings in the city, which have been 10% lower than the England average for the past decade.While house price growth has affected many parts of the country, since the pandemic it has been “significantly higher in Exeter than other geographies” at nearly 18%, compared with less than 7% in Devon and 7.5% across England.Exeter rents are also “much higher than both Devon and England” while rental property availability has “sharply decreased” since the pandemic, by 41%, with attendant implications for the city’s ability to “attract and retain talent”, particularly younger people.Increasingly unaffordable housing combined with poor public transport is “forcing many individuals working in the city but living outside to commute via car” which “prevents those on lower earnings from either remaining in, or locating to, the area”.Meanwhile low living standards and limited wellbeing are both identified as problems for those on lower wages “who do remain”.Exeter’s “deprivation performance” was found to be “poorer than the Devon average for health and disability, crime, education, skills and training” and the city is at risk of becoming a “two tier economy” in which “residents either work remotely in high skilled, high value roles, or work locally in lower skilled service sectors supporting these individuals”.Economic activity levelsThe research also found that the rate of economic activity in Exeter has “experienced a large fall since the COVID-19 pandemic” with the proportion of economically active over 50’s falling by more than 13%, twice as much as across Devon.There are also “far fewer economically active people in the 20 to 24 age group in Exeter compared to Devon and England”.This is reflected in high vacancy rates “across many sectors and occupations” which have increased since the pandemic. Vacancy rates in some sectors, such as transportation, have more than doubled.There are now more than 6,000 vacancies in health care in the Exeter area. Health and social work, which constitutes nearly a fifth of Exeter’s employment market, has “consistently had the highest number of vacancies” for the past ten years.By 2030 Exeter is expected to need at least 3,500 more workers in this sector, which may be an underestimate “given the acute ageing population in Devon where Exeter provides a major health and care centre for the surrounding local authorities who all have rapidly ageing populations”.School and college leavers and graduates, who are targeted for these jobs, may be deterred by “the challenges of housing affordability, transport and attractiveness of Exeter as a destination”.Meanwhile the local construction sector, which is partly being propped up by the “inward migration of older demographics purchasing homes and the rate of second home ownership” in the area, is experiencing “shortages in many roles and skill areas”.Replacement demand alone, exacerbated by an ageing workforce, is expected to mean 30,000 new construction workers will be needed in the region by 2025.The key recruitment barrier in multiple sectors, from arts and culture to professional services, is identified as “sufficient pay for the high cost of living”.Graduate retentionInsufficient pay is not the only reason for Exeter’s low graduate retention rate. Poor job prospects also play a significant role, with 42% of workers in Devon underemployed in jobs for which they are overqualified.Both the University of Exeter and Exeter College also have “higher than UK average rates for unemployment and other outcomes including travel and caring”.In addition, Exeter has “significantly lower rates of young people going into education than the UK average” in the first place, with less than a third of 16-18 year olds in Exeter going into sustained education  compared with nearly half across the UK.Only 9% of University of Exeter undergraduates come from Devon, and only a quarter from the wider South West region.Fifteen months after graduating less than 7% of the university’s graduates that came from elsewhere remain in Devon.A large majority leave for London and the South East where they are still to be found five years later, by which time there has been no net graduate retention at all across the South West region.Despite the extraordinary increase in Exeter university student numbers, at nearly three and a half times the rate across the UK higher education sector in recent years, graduate retention rates remain low.So while Exeter appears to be a relatively young city, the “very high inflows of 15 to 19 year-olds” is “mirrored by comparative outflows for ages 20-24”.The presence of such a large and expanding student body does, however, have a significant impact on the affordability and availability of housing in the city.There are currently nearly 16,000 students living in more than 4,500 Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) which could otherwise be used for residential housing by local people. Around 500 more dwellings are expected to be lost to this use during the next academic year.Renting to students is much more profitable for landlords than renting to residents, not only because high turnover rates facilitate regular rent increases but also because students pay much higher rents.Like inwardly migrant older people buying houses with wealth accumulated in other parts of the country, the ability of many students to pay much higher housing costs than local people is disconnected from Exeter’s economy.If the council wants to make living and working in Exeter more viable for young people and graduates, as well as economically-active incomers with skills the city needs, and address its labour supply shortages, it cannot avoid confronting the university’s impact on housing affordability and availability.Exeter’s economic viability challenges cannot be dealt with by an employment and skills strategy alone, however well-evidenced."

But it still failed to include a report which was discussed at the meeting and has yet to publish anything about the board meeting it held at the beginning of June.The March meeting minutes nevertheless did include details of a presentation about a predominantly greenfield 60-acre business park development at Peamore in which Global City Futures, Exeter City Futures’ parent company, is involved.LDA Design, which is also helping Exeter City Futures pitch the fund, is involved in the development too.The ostensibly eco-friendly business park, which the meeting heard was “less than 10-15 minutes’ walk to the city centre” despite being four miles as the crow flies from the company’s Paris Street offices, unashamedly touts its “proximity to key arterial roads” at the intersection of the M5/A38 and A379."

"content" : "Devon County Council has announced “enhancements” which it claims will “mitigate the impact” of the South West Exeter extension on the residents of Alphington village, through which much of the traffic the development is expected to generate will pass.The changes, which constitute the widening of short sections of pavement and installation of a zebra crossing (or possibly two, “subject to funding availability”) are to be made following a public consultation which ended in January.The consultation’s design produced ambiguous results which enabled a wide range of interpretations, as the county council demonstrated in deriving its conclusions from the data.It also made no attempt to compensate for the dominance of older respondents by weighting consultation responses to be more representative or address the fact that younger people will spend much longer living with the consequences of the minor changes it intends to make.The cost of the changes will be met from a £55.14 million grant from the national Housing Infrastructure Fund for South West Exeter extension infrastructure spending.The county council allocated just 1% of its bid for this money to Alphington traffic impact mitigation: £500,000.It has not increased this allocation despite more than £3 million of the original budget having since become available for other uses and the failure of the South West Exeter extension district heating network scheme to which it had allocated another £5.3 million.75% of the Housing Infrastructure Fund grant, more than £41 million, was to be spent on new roads or increasing the vehicle capacity of existing roads in the area.The development is expected to mean more than 3,500 additional motor vehicles using the Alphington corridor to drive into and through Exeter when it is complete.The predominantly greenfield 90 hectare South West Exeter extension site stretches from Alphington to the M5 with the A379 dividing it in two.The development will be larger than Exminster and will include 2,500 new homes, a school for 1,400 pupils, shops and other facilities.It is an extension of Exeter’s suburbs, although 80% of the housing will sit in the neighbouring Teignbridge district.Employment land is also allocated nearby, where Global City Futures, Exeter City Futures’ parent company, and LDA Design, which is partly responsible for the city council’s Liveable Exeter property development scheme, are part of a consortium building a 60 acre business park.Planned housing at the development is characterised by low density layouts with multi-car parking spaces or garages and driveways, and there is nothing in the city council’s South West Alphington development brief or the Teigbbridge Local Plan to prevent this continuing.In many cases pavements are not provided and developer marketing materials promote car use, including driving to local schools and “easy access to the A30, A38 and M5”.There are already more than 25,000 motor vehicle movements a day along Alphington Street, and further major housing developments are expected alongside the South West Exeter extension, on the other side of the A30, which will also rely on the Alphington corridor to access Exeter.South West Exeter extension development planAlphington village traffic impact mitigation measures were initially proposed in 2014, following the publication of the South West Exeter development masterplan.They were included in the South West Alphington development brief, which forms part of the city’s planning policy framework.It describes their purpose as the enforcement of a 20mph speed limit through the village.The measures ran from Alphin Brook roundabout along the length of Church Road and on to the Chudleigh Road double mini roundabout.They included extensive pavement widening and three raised zebra crossings, two at the St Michael’s and All Angels Church triangle and another beside the double mini roundabout.The county council said they were aimed at “improving the public realm in Alphington, supporting walking and cycling and discouraging through traffic”.It confirmed that the scheme’s aims remained the same late last year when it launched a public consultation to revisit the proposals.2014 South West Alphington development brief village schemeHowever the consultation that took place introduced revised proposals with reduced scope and scale which divided the original scheme into three sections and presented each as separate locations for “potential public realm enhancements” .Three options were offered at each location, with consultation respondents invited to rank each option at each location in preference order, as well as ranking each location in preference order on the basis “funding may not cover all the work identified”.Two of the options at two of the locations included similar proposals, skewing the results.Preference-ranking proportional representation voting systems only function correctly when the choices on offer are discrete: overlapping options make their results unrepresentative.The county council also said elements of the options it offered could be “removed or swapped to allow for other proposals to come forward”, although it didn’t make clear whether this meant it would consider consultee proposals or simply that it might decide to change its proposals again.                                                            Revised scheme consultation optionsThe consultation produced 168 responses of which six were from local organisations including Alphington Village Forum and Exeter Cycling Campaign.Instead of simply reproducing response preference numbers in its consultation results report, as it did with age group bandings, the county council converted them into percentages.Not only did this introduce rounding that did not accurately convey close margins between preferences with similar levels of support, it also disguised the fact that not all respondents ranked all options.As the county council did not say how many respondents fell into this group, or whether some ranked only one and others two or three options, its use of percentages may misrepresent the results altogether.The county council nevertheless went further, adopting highly selective result interpretation methods.The largest number of first preferences were cast in favour of no change at Alphin Brook roundabout. The county council instead emphasised that “installation of a zebra crossing was included in the first choice of 60% of the respondents”.It derived this figure by adding together first choice preferences for options two and three, which it described as respondents “choosing” these options, thus counting preferences for the same zebra crossing installation twice.It apparently nevertheless did not consider there to be any significance in option two gaining 75% second preference support in addition to 20% first preference support.Does this mean option two was more or less popular overall than options one or three, which gained 41% and 40% first preference support (notwithstanding rounding errors) but only 12% second preference support?And how might our conclusions differ with the knowledge that not all respondents ranked all options?The county council’s approach to the Church triangle results was similar. Here it emphasised that 59% of respondents least preferred option three.If it thinks the largest share of third preference votes was decisive at the Church triangle, then why not also so at Alphin Brook roundabout?It was at least consistent in ignoring the support for option two conveyed by 95% of respondents again choosing it as their first or second preference.At Chudleigh Road it changed its tune again, this time emphasising that the most popular first choice was no change.Here, however, it noted that 62% chose option two as their second preference. This is 13% less than the second choice preference share at the other locations, and the first choice preference share for option two at Chudleigh Road was also lower.It further failed to explain what it made of the largest share of third preference votes going to the same option that received the largest share of first preference votes.Does the county council think this makes this option the most popular while simultaneously disqualifying it?At least the county council acknowledged that the location options results were more decisive, with Alphin Brook roundabout most preferred and Chudleigh Road least.However it still found that as Chudleigh Road “did have some support” both options two and three might be progressed there. It would definitely make no changes at Church triangle, though.It also concluded that the public had chosen option three at Alphin Brook roundabout, which it said was supported by “the majority of the responses” despite the data.It said it derived these conclusions on the basis that the “main aim of the consultation was to identify a deliverable scheme using funding secured from development in the area”.This was not what the consultation documents said. They described its aims as the improvement of public realm, providing support for walking and cycling and discouraging through traffic.Despite the largest share of first preferences at all three locations favouring no change, the county council then announced public support for its proposals.The county council also said it had relied on additional comments and suggestions from consultation respondents for its verdict.These comments were dominated by support for traffic speed limit enforcement and speed reduction interventions as well as improved active and sustainable travel facilities including modal filters and cycle lanes.Exeter Cycling Campaign urged the county council to employ a “high raised table and a sharp approach gradient” at all zebra crossings.Alphington Village Forum pointed out that without such speed table construction, zebra crossings only help slow traffic when they are in use, and emphasised that the county council had already said it would include raised crossings in its original scheme.It added that it did not understand why the county council had reduced the scope of its plans, which had been drawn up after extensive consultation, especially since “traffic has already increased over the last seven years” leading to roads being “frequently grid-locked”.It said traffic should be slowed down along the whole length of Church Road, Chudleigh Road, Dawlish Road and Ide Lane as far as the school, instead of just in the centre of the village, adding: “several of these roads are really dangerous.”It described the consultation as “undemocratic”, with “no transparency”, and offered extensive criticism of the revised proposals, pointing out that the county council intends to widen the wrong pavements, based on footfall, and is not addressing prominent pedestrian safety issues such as places where wheelchair users are forced into the road.It said: “What is needed most of all is enforcement of the 20mph speed limits throughout the village”.The consultation also found that many respondents supported traffic reduction in Ide Lane and in the vicinity of Alphington Primary School.Alphington Village Forum described this as “another dangerous area” where “hundreds of primary school children walk and cycle every day during term-time”.It also observed that it “would be easy to put a cycle lane in Dawlish Road leading to Clapperbrook Lane, but this road has been ignored.”Exeter Cycling Campaign pointed out that the consultation did not address the South West Exeter Masterplan commitment to designating Dawlish Road as a Green Lane.It warned that without a modal filter Dawlish Road would become “a heavily-trafficked route to and from the South West Exeter development”.The county council did not, however, mention the masterplan or propose to do anything about traffic in Ide Lane, introduce any speed limit enforcement in the area or deliver any cycling infrastructure at all.It nevertheless said, despite providing no supporting evidence, that “the measures to be introduced are expected to limit vehicle speeds, helping to encourage cycling”.It added that it would carry out “investigations into the potential” to raise zebra crossings, but warned that it would take into account “any potential negative impacts such as noise”.

"content" : "The second of two RAMM-hosted Liveable Exeter promotional events, focussed on Exeter’s future as a “garden city”, took place last night with the city council’s Director of City Development, Ian Collinson topping the bill.Despite having been in post since April, and having overall responsibility for the development of the new Exeter Local Plan and the council’s property development schemes, Mr Collinson appears not to know that the city has more than a dozen significant employment sites in addition to the city centre, or that Exeter suffers from significant outbound, as well as inbound, commuting.He also seems to think that Exeter’s labour supply problems result from too few people living here, rather than its falling economic activity levels, and that other cities haven’t found solutions for the problems Exeter faces, despite many being far ahead on liveability and decarbonisation.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Meanwhile the basic rationale for the Liveable Exeter-financing Exeter Development Fund — that the council’s planning policy and development control powers and its ownership of many of the scheme’s intended development sites are insufficient to ensure the delivery of low carbon design — continues to shed credibility.Not only has the government confirmed that local planning authorities are free to set higher standards than the national Building Regulations for energy efficiency, it has since extended these and other related design quality standards to include electric vehicle charging infrastructure.New detailed design codes are also on their way, which can be used to set stringent standards in much greater detail than planning policy documents.They can cover environmental and energy efficiency standards, walking and cycling infrastructure specifications and public realm requirements, among many other development delivery details, and are expected to come into force before the new Exeter Local Plan is adopted."

"content" : "Exeter City Council has rejected calls for greater community involvement in planning policy-making and application decisions, defending its existing approach despite an eight week consultation on community involvement in planning matters producing just seventeen responses.The consultation on the council’s new Statement of Community Involvement, a statutory document which sets out how it will involve communities, businesses and others in the preparation of planning policies as well as determining individual planning applications, took place between September and November last year.Several organisations simply responded to clarify their status as consultees without commenting on the document itself, while others submitted responses which were not relevant.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Exeter Civic Society, Exeter Green Party and the Progressive Group of councillors on Exeter City Council submitted the most substantial consultation responses, between them comprising nearly two thirds of total submissions.Each called for greater commitment to community involvement in planning decisions, describing the council’s approach as a “wholly inadequate offering” in the context of the challenges that Exeter faces and saying it should instead be “going beyond consultation to enable proper community engagement”.The council responded by saying its approach complied with the minimum standards set out in the legislation, adding that it was “flexible” and allowed for “a range of approaches” which would be “explored further as we move forward”.It cited its “limited resources” and “the need to make progress” on the local plan as reasons for not committing to greater community involvement, and made no changes in response to nearly three-quarters  of the issues raised by the three.It also made no changes in response to half the issues raised by the other respondents.Despite the very low consultation response rate, several Labour councillors expressed satisfaction with the outcome at last week’s council executive meeting.Martin Pearce said: “Lots of comments have come forward but very few of them actually require changes, which says to me that we’re already doing what the community wants us to do and not just ticking all the boxes”.Council leader Phil Bialyk added that he is “more than satisfied with how we consult in this city”.Exeter Civic Society, Exeter Green Party and the Progressive Group also all criticised the council for not being proactive in promoting neighbourhood planning, which enables local groups to create planning policy which becomes part of the wider development plan framework.An £18,000 government grant and comprehensive free technical support is on offer to community groups that want to create neighbourhood plans.Such plans are enabling communities around the country to prevent new housing being used as second homes or holiday lets and to block construction of Purpose Built Student Accommodation and conversion of existing residential housing stock to shared student accommodation.The civic society pointed out that the council had not updated its neighbourhood planning protocol since 2012 and had not promoted government guidance or key neighbourhood planning resources on its website.At last week’s executive meeting Liberal Democrat councillor Kevin Mitchell urged the council to do more to promote neighbourhood planning in Exeter and Conservative councillor Anne Jobson said the council’s Statement of Community Involvement should make clear funding is available to enable neighbourhood planning groups.Council leader Phil Bialyk said there was no need to do more than supply links to online resources via its website, which the council has now done.  New Exeter Local Plan  The new Exeter Local Plan will replace the city’s 2012 Core Strategy and the policies saved from the 1995-2011 Exeter Local Plan First Review when it is adopted.  It is expected to facilitate the Liveable Exeter property development scheme, and the Exeter Development Fund which is intended to deliver it, by providing a scheme-focussed “vision and framework for the future development of the city”.  County mineral and waste plans also form part of Exeter’s planning policy framework, as do Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) which provide additional guidance.  Exeter’s SPDs will be reviewed in the context of emerging Exeter Local Plan policies as well as ongoing changes to the National Planning Policy Framework, but not directly as part of the new local plan process.  Neighbourhood plans, produced by local groups, also form part of planning policy frameworks. Exeter’s includes one such plan which covers the St James area.  An evidence base also supports and informs local planning policy development.  The timetable for the preparation of the new local plan is set out in the 2021 Local Development Scheme:      September 2021: an initial consultation framed the content and scope of the plan    September 2022: a resulting draft plan will be published for public consultation    February 2023: a revised plan will be published for formal comments on its legal compliance and soundness    June 2023: the resulting draft final plan will be submitted to the planning inspectorate with formal comments and supporting evidence    October 2023: a planning inspector will examine the submissions, hold plan examination hearings, propose any necessary changes and produce a final report    June 2024: the final plan will be adopted.    Only those who submit formal comments at the revised plan publication stage can take part in plan examination hearings.  However the government recently made clear that it intends to expand the role of neighbourhood planning groups in making planning policy.It confirmed earlier this month that the planning system reforms it wants to retain from the 2020 planning white paper will be included in the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill.Local authority area-wide design codes will be required to act as frameworks for detailed design codes which can be prepared for specific areas by neighbourhood planning groups.Design codes can be used to set stringent standards, to which developers must adhere in order to get planning permission, in much greater detail than planning policy documents.They can cover environmental and energy efficiency standards, walking and cycling infrastructure specifications, public realm requirements and usage considerations such as tenure mix among many other development delivery details.The government also intends to introduce a more accessible local planning tool called a “neighbourhood priorities statement” to enable communities to directly influence planning policy.It will help communities to identify priorities and preferences for their areas and provide a basis on which they can create full neighbourhood plans.The new neighbourhood planning provisions, which will become part of the city’s planning policy framework, are expected to come into force before the new Exeter Local Plan is adopted.They will offer communities greater involvement and enhanced powers in planning policy-making and application decisions whether the council promotes them or not."

"content" : "On Monday morning, as people return to work after the long bank holiday weekend, Exeter’s Highways and Traffic Orders Committee (Exeter HaTOC) is expected to approve expenditure of £900,000 to make temporary changes to a 200 metre section of Magdalen Road permanent.The changes were introduced two years ago under emergency coronavirus powers during the first wave of the pandemic to facilitate pedestrian social distancing beside the retail traders which line this stretch of the street.They involved repurposing the eastbound traffic lane to widen the pavement behind a temporary barrier, which is interrupted by three loading bays, and to make space for a painted cycle lane.Motor vehicles travelling in that direction have been diverted onto other routes while access to the street’s fifteen free car parking bays remains from its eastern end.Having driven up the street the wrong way along the cycle path, a van continues east through the Mount Radford traffic lights.The temporary changes caused considerable controversy and have since been the subject of three consultations and a trio of reports by the local transport authority, Devon County Council.None of its reports include any data on vehicle access and parking despite much of the controversy focussing on arguments around these issues in relation to the street’s retail traders.The county council could not explain this omission when asked. Its principal public consultation on the changes did not provide any street usage data at all, despite inviting respondents to choose between four street use options, and only mentioned unspecified delivery costs and timescales for the low traffic street option, apparently in order to discourage respondents from choosing it.When a decisive majority did then choose it, the county council’s report on the consultation misrepresented its results, which it did not publish until after a decision had been taken in favour of keeping the changes that had already been made.This option only had the support of 18% of respondents but the county council nevertheless recommended it. 25% wanted to return the street to two-way traffic.In making this recommendation the county council also prioritised the views of just ten of the street’s retail traders over those of nearly 1,500 local residents and frequent visitors to the area.It now wants Exeter HaTOC to cement these changes in place, claiming they will reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and encourage modal shift away from car use despite providing no evidence to support these claims.It has nevertheless admitted that westbound traffic and traffic on adjacent roads have both increased and the changes have made car journeys in the area longer.Magdalen Road low traffic street visualisation. Image: St Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association.How has Devon County Council contrived to arrive at a recommendation to spend so much public money on changes that so few people want instead of delivering the changes supported by the majority?By the time Exeter HaTOC met in July last year to consider the public consultation results, twelve months after the temporary changes had been introduced, it was clear that there were numerous strong opinions on all sides of the argument.St Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association had already conducted a large poll which produced hundreds of critical comments and a similar volume of positive feedback.It nevertheless found strong support for discussion of permanent pedestrian improvements alongside vehicle traffic reductions, and also generated around 150 suggestions for improvements to the scheme, many of which were in favour of some form of low traffic street layout.Lorries are unable to avoid blocking the cycle lane when parked in the HGV loading bay and their drivers are forced to unload in front of oncoming traffic.The county council provided the July committee meeting with a report which summarised the consultation results instead of publishing them.It did not publish them until after the meeting had been held and the decision to make the changes permanent had been taken.The county council’s summary report was replete with statements which misrepresented the results.It paraphrased the result that 53% of respondents wanted a low traffic street as the option “preferred by the greatest number of respondents”.Instead of stating that only 18% wanted to make the temporary changes permanent, it said this option “also received more positive (agree/strongly agree) than negative (disagree/strongly disagree) responses”.(When the consultation results did appear these figures were presented as “&amp;gt;50%” and “20%”.)The report then went on to say that while a low traffic street “would provide the best environment for pedestrians and cyclists and provide additional street space for pavement cafes and ancillary business activity”, removing parking “could be detrimental to some of the traders”.The HGV loading bay is opposite the turn to Wonford Road, making that section of the street more dangerous for eastbound cyclists when lorries are parked there.The report’s 300-word “options discussion and appraisal” section then combined the misrepresented findings.It mentioned in passing that 85% of respondents identified pedestrian facilities as their highest priority, but failed to mention that more people also wanted clean air, pavement cafes, wider footways and seating as well as cycling facilities than wanted on-street parking.It then rejected both options to reverse the one way setup, on the grounds that a majority disagreed with them, without mentioning that a majority also disagreed with making the temporary changes permanent.Instead of then concluding that it should deliver a low traffic street as the only option with majority support, further corroborated by the finding that 75% of respondents wanted to reduce through traffic to provide more space for pedestrians and cyclists, it said “the most deliverable option” was to make the temporary changes permanent.It said this was because a low traffic street “would be the most expensive of the options to deliver and likely to require external funding” which “would create the risk of a significant delay”, but provided neither costings, nor funding, budget or design options, nor delivery timescales to support this claim.The county council says it hopes that “widening the bays will make parking easier”. Widening the bays will not make prevent vehicles obstructing both lanes during parking manoeuvres.Nor did the report make clear that the 50:50 split it found between those retail traders in favour of and those against reducing through traffic represented only one third of the street’s 29 retail traders on each side of the argument.The preferences of the other third were not included. (Since the scheme was introduced one third of the street’s retail traders have changed.)It did not explain how it had weighted the views of twenty retail traders against those of nearly 1,500 other consultation respondents, almost all of whom were local residents or frequent visitors to the area.More than 1,100 of them were in favour of reducing through traffic to provide more space for pedestrians and cyclists and nearly 1,300 identified pedestrian facilities as the most important priority.Despite being a principal arterial cycling route more commercial vehicles passed through the street during our Saturday morning survey period than bicycles. The weather was set fair.None of the nine Labour councillors present at the meeting challenged these misrepresentations, omissions or sophistic conclusions.Apart from Conservative Percy Prowse, all the committee members duly voted to do what the county council wanted: to take the steps necessary to make the temporary changes permanent.Fast forward twelve months to a final report to next Monday’s Exeter HaTOC meeting which summarises a third consultation that finished in April, this one on the detail of the permanent changes.This found that even when asked to support making the temporary changes permanent with no other options on offer, only 51% of responses from the St Leonard’s area were in favour.It also found that the number of respondents who support some form of low traffic street layout equals the number who support making the temporary changes permanent, but disguised this by grouping the responses separately in a table tucked away in an appendix.It cited the previous public consultation as a basis on which to reject responses proposing full pedestrianisation, despite its results, and claimed that “total traffic volumes across the area” had been reduced despite also admitting that traffic and pollution in nearby streets had increased.In response to several objections that the county council does not listen to residents, it said: “The scheme has been developed following several phases of consultation, the results of which have been considered in developing these proposals”.A multi-drop parcel van driver parked in the cycle lane ten metres beyond an empty loading bay shortly before another delivery driver parked on the pavement opposite the same empty bay.The report also confirmed that westbound Magdalen Road motor traffic had increased since the changes were introduced to around 3,100 vehicles between 7am and 7pm each day.The permanent contraflow cycle lane will nevertheless not be physically segregated from traffic because it will be “advisory rather than mandatory”, nor will the fact that vehicles using the loading bays obstruct it be addressed.The report still claims that the 200 metre scheme is likely to “make cycling a safe and attractive option for a wider range of people including, for example, children”.It also evaluates it as providing the maximum possible impact on strategic priorities including “responding to the climate emergency”, “investing in Devon’s economic recovery” and “improving health and well being”.Temporary changes made permanent: detailed plans for Magdalen Road.Exeter Observer performed a survey of its own last week, to gather some of the data on vehicle access and parking that has been conspicuously absent from the county council’s reports, and so take a snapshot of how people actually use the current arrangements.We counted cars, motorcycles, commercial vehicles and bicycles entering and exiting the street during three one-hour periods on Friday and Saturday morning while also monitoring loading bay and car parking bay use.We found that more than 90% of the motor vehicles passing the shops are through traffic and almost all of the limited use of the Magdalen Road parking bays is driven by convenience rather than necessity.We found that an average of 276 motor vehicles per hour used the street, among which an average of 25 per hour arrived to park: just 9%.Vehicles that parked and left during our survey periods stayed an average of 14 minutes. Only seven motorists parked legally for longer than 30 minutes, none of whom appeared to visit the shops.Twelve other vehicles were parked illegally for more than an hour, one of which was there all morning and another which was parked in a loading bay.Only a handful of parking bay users who returned to their vehicles during our survey periods were carrying more than a single shopping bag. Many were not carrying anything at all.A striking proportion of large SUVs with only one occupant parked during our survey periods, while several drivers left their engines running throughout their stays, one for nearly an hour.We confirmed that some nearby residents drive their cars to Magdalen Road shops for convenience because there is nothing preventing them doing so, not because they have mobility issues or cannot carry their shopping home.In contrast we witnessed one elderly shopper carrying a half-case of six bottles from the wine merchant to the 213-bay council pay and display car park on the corner of Western Way.This car park is less than 100 metres from the western end of the shopping street, closer than the easternmost street parking bays.Drivers often ignore the free parking bays, instead parking beside the pedestrian crossing, in loading bays or simply stopping in the middle of the street to pick up passengers while others queue behind.The county council’s February 2021 public consultation singled out the low traffic street option, saying it “would be the most expensive of the proposed options” and “would likely require external funding” with “the longest timescales for delivery”.Its July 2021 report then relied on the same unsupported claim to justify its conclusion that “the most deliverable option” was to make the temporary changes permanent.The members of Exeter HaTOC agreed.However, as the county council’s report to Monday’s meeting confirms, making the temporary changes permanent also required external funding: £500,000 from the Department of Transport on top of £400,000 from its own budget.It also confirms that making the temporary changes permanent takes a very long time too: it has been two years so far and works are not expected to begin until January 2023.The county council’s justification for not considering another option now? It would delay delivery and cost money.

The conclusion that the county council will do what it wants at Magadalen Road, irrespective of public opinion, is unavoidable.We asked it what made the low traffic street option so much more expensive than making the temporary changes permanent that it wasn’t willing to deliver it.It didn’t mention a desire to keep 6,000+ westbound cars a day off the bottom of Heavitree Road.We were instead told that the extra cost of materials entailed by high design standards was what made a low traffic street so undesirable. (Both options require works on both sides of the road entailing overnight road closures and traffic management, so these costs are similar either way.)When we asked why the county council’s design standards could not be lowered, within statutory limits, to make a low traffic street deliverable we didn’t receive a reply.Members of the public are free to attend Monday’s Exeter HaTOC meeting. It begins at 10.30am in the council chamber at County Hall."

Event preview and gallery.IN CASE YOU MISSED ITExeter Digest #12 was a 2022 local elections special. We highlighted a four-part series examining Exeter Labour’s campaign claims, an assessment of last year’s councillor attendance at public council meetings and an insider’s guide to the poll.EXETER’S HOUSING CRISIS: The first part in our series examined Exeter Labour campaign claims related to the housing crisis overtaking the city.ECONOMY &amp;amp; CITY CENTRE: Part two examined the party’s claims about the city centre and Exeter’s wider economy.CLIMATE &amp;amp; ENVIRONMENT: Part three examined the party’s claims about climate crisis leadership, renewable energy, recycling, retrofitting and development standards as well as decisions to scrap council and city decarbonisation goals.COUNCIL TAX: The final part of the series was a coda examining Exeter Labour’s claim that the city has one of the lowest rates of council tax in the country.NOTES &amp;amp; SKETCHESHOW TO INFLATE HOUSING COSTS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLEDespite Exeter’s rapidly worsening housing crisis, the council continued its relentless promotion of the city as a destination to potential incomers by commissioning a coterie of Instagram influencers to flog the place to their followers after spending a May weekend here.Go South West England, Candace Abroad and Flying Fluskey (no kidding) duly produced various “journalism-style articles” discussing the city’s “culture and history” as part of a £10,000 marketing campaign, the cost of which is being split 50/50 between the council and GWR on the basis it promotes visiting Exeter by train.One influencer said St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre had been built on the site of a recently-demolished bus station and described Jury’s Inn as both a “4-star” and “mid-range” hotel, before offering helpful detail on how to get to each by car and where to park.Another encouraged visitors to “hop in a car” in the city centre to get to Dartmoor, or to drive to a Crediton cider orchard, and advised readers that of Exeter’s “three main shopping centres, all based around the High Street”, one is to be found at Countess Wear.Perhaps it is unfair to expect council-commissioned communications to adhere to recognised fact-checking standards, but whether this expenditure meets public spending value for money criteria is another matter.Meanwhile cider must be on the menu in council meetings, judging by a year-long project it has commissioned in conjunction with the university which “explores the complex ecology and cultures of cider-making” and “communal drinking culture”.And it’s only a 25 minute drive from the council’s offices to the cider farm (this one near Tedburn St Mary) where various project-related events are taking place.RAMM-BUNCTIOUSThe city’s museum is the latest Exeter institution to get roped into fronting Liveable Exeter property development scheme promotion.Top of the bill last night at the first of two RAMM-hosted Liveable Exeter pitches focussed on the future of the High Street was the city council’s chief executive.In what was presumably a Freudian slip, the museum’s event promo page initially said he was there to explain what was being done to make Exeter a more exclusive city, before it was amended to say “inclusive” instead.Explanations of how Exeter City Futures would decarbonise the city and the role of Liveable Exeter Place Board were also trailed, but the former only got a single mention and the latter none at all.Instead, attendees were offered a potted history of the ways in which the council’s vision for the High Street has supposedly been persistently prescient.Twenty years ago, we were told, city centre retail’s principal challenge was out of town retail developments, which needed seeing off with big new shopping centres and department stores.It seems no-one at Paris Street had then heard of Amazon and eBay, both of which were already seven years old, or Google, which by then had become a verb.It apparently took until 2007, after the council had successfully “overcome” 5,000 objections to the redevelopment of Princesshay, for the internet to become a threat to the very shopping centres and department stores the council had been promoting.Falling demand for such facilities didn’t deter it from pursuing a Princesshay extension on the other side of Paris Street for the following decade, or from allocating £55 million to buy back the lease on the Guildhall shopping centre last year to “secure its future use” despite already owning the freehold.Despite this the council now thinks the city centre’s future depends primarily on attracting residents and visitors.Whether these residents are expected to stick around for more than a term at a time is not clear, but the visitor attraction bar was raised yesterday by the arrival of plastic dinosaurs in Northernhay Gardens.The dinosaurs are being kept behind locked gates, presumably to protect them from angry Exeter residents who are being denied access to Northernhay Gardens for the best part of a month.Adult entry starts at £12 plus booking fee for those who fancy chewing over appropriate use of public parks with a T-Rex.Much more inclusively-priced is the free second RAMM-hosted Liveable Exeter promo pitch on Thursday 9 June, where Exeter’s future as a “garden city” will be top of the bill.Roll up and get your tickets here.

ON OUR RADARFRIDAY 27 MAY // CAST A SHEEP’S EYEJoe Levy and Konstantinos Terzakis perform 16th and 17th century Renaissance and Baroque love songs by Purcell, Dowland, Morley and others in a series of concerts in historic buildings.SUNDAY 29 MAY // SOUND WALKSMusician and sound artist Emma Welton is leading a series of Sunday afternoon sound walks as part of Exeter Dream Festival.SATURDAY 11 &amp;amp; SUNDAY 12 JUNE // EXETER RESPECT FESTIVALExeter Respect Festival returns to Belmont Park for its 25th anniversary with live music and performance, food stalls, campaigners and community groups.ON OUR READING LISTLEVELLING UPThe government finally published its Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill earlier this month, which it trailed as a plan to “transform struggling towns and cities” and support local leaders “to take back control of regeneration”.An accompanying policy paper claimed the bill would give “local leaders and communities the tools they need to make better places”.The Town and County Planning Association immediately disagreed, describing it as a “decisive shift of power to Whitehall” which includes the removal of existing rights in relation to the planning process and new powers for the government to change the system through secondary legislation and override local planning policy in decision-making.Much uncertainty remains around the issues which the bill is supposed to address, not least those planning system reform proposals which the bill has recycled from Robert Jenrick’s defunct 2020 planning white paper.Last year’s select committee report criticising the white paper is worth a look, as is the government’s response to the report, which it published the day after the Levelling Up bill’s first reading.The bill’s second commons reading is due on 8 June before it goes to committee stage.There’s a lot to digest. For starters we recommend a Local Government Association analysis of the bill’s planning provisions and  a Shelter briefing note on the opportunity it presents to ensure much more social housing is built.The reformed national system, the details of which are still yet to be decided, is expected to come into force at the same time as Exeter’s new local plan is adopted.Development of the new local plan is nevertheless well under way, with a first draft due in September.The importance of both these parallel processes to Exeter’s prospects can hardly be overstated. We will endeavour to keep readers up to speed with critically-informed coverage of both as they develop.CLIMATE CRISISThe World Meteorological Association published its latest State of the Global Climate report last week.The report confirmed that the past seven years have been the warmest seven years on record, with four key climate change indicator records being broken in 2021.At the same time the Institute for Government published a new report examining incoherent UK net zero policy-making which highlights a “series of decisions where ministers seem to have undermined their own climate objectives”.These include road-building, cutting air passenger duty on domestic flights, boosting UK oil and gas production and its approval of a new coal mine in Cumbria.Interesting IfG recommendations include the creation of a new independent body charged with forecasting the emissions impact of policies and other decisions, to sit somewhere between the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Climate Change Committee, following a model used in Denmark.Meanwhile, a literature review commissioned by My Society considers the significant role that local government must play in climate change mitigation, following reports by the Climate Change Committee, National Audit Office and Energy Systems Catapult which all say that decarbonisation depends on strong local involvement.It finds that people strongly support net zero policies including frequent flyer levies, carbon taxes, improved public transport and support for replacing gas boilers but, when asked about priorities for their community, emphasise issues including affordable housing, vibrant high streets, green spaces and youth employment.It also finds that the public makes little distinction between different tiers of government, not understanding the scope and limits of each, so recommends more effective public education and engagement as well as transparent decarbonisation targets and monitoring mechanisms.LOCALGOV POLLResearch carried out by Ipsos for the Local Government Information Unit in the run-up to this year’s local elections reinforced this lack of local democracy literacy.Despite most people believing local councils have the most impact on their everyday lives and the quality of life in their area, more than half of Britons claim to know “not very much” or “nothing at all” about the work of local councillors or how decisions are taken locally.Unsurprisingly, nearly two thirds say they want more information about what’s going on locally and/or more of a say in how local decisions are made.DCMS SELECT COMMITTEEWhich is where local public interest journalism comes in, or would more readily if the £1 billion annual public subsidy that is being given to three sinking legacy local news conglomerates to keep them afloat was instead redirected towards it.So said members of the panel giving oral evidence on the sustainability of local journalism to the commons DCMS select committee last week.The committee gathered a wide range of written evidence for its inquiry into the challenges facing local news organisations earlier this year.This session was an opportunity for proponents of the approach being followed by Exeter Observer, among others, to set out their stall, contrasting accountable, independent public interest journalism with a business model which commodifies news and corrodes the public sphere with misinformation, causing people to disengage with democracy altogether.Adam Cantwell-Corn of The Bristol Cable incisively described the problems caused by the economics of ad-sustained journalism when global technology platforms control advertising markets as well as the social media which drive audience attention.He pointed out that legacy titles are forcing journalists to produce five or more “fast food” stories a day, chasing website traffic at the colossal volumes necessary to collect what is a tiny share of the tech giants’ revenue, traffic that can only be attracted via social media platform incentive structures which favour the polarising content which supports their profits.He also pointed out that the legacy “local” titles which are now, in the UK, almost all owned by just three companies are no longer local because so much of their content is produced by regional or national hubs, with up to 90% of their website traffic coming from outside the areas their titles claim to cover.How could the £1 billion instead be spent? It could be used to support the development of business models which are focussed on outcomes, such as increases in trust and democratic engagement, instead of simply churning out cheap, quick, provocative content and reducing readers to consumers rather than considering them as citizens or members of a community.Watch the session or read the transcript (session II) then join Exeter Observer on its mission to strengthen civil society and help people participate more effectively in local democracy.SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT JOURNALISMThere are lots of ways you can help Exeter Observer to thrive:      Share this newsletter with your friends and family and encourage them to subscribe free.

It is regularly used by residents for leisure and sports activities, many of whom objected strongly to the plans.Local resident Jacqueline Mead said they are “a beautiful area that everyone enjoys, from dog walkers to parents and grandparents playing games, running, walking, picnicking”.She added that the playing fields were “intended for the whole community, not just those who belong to the college.”Terry Cole said that the fields “should be available for everyone to enjoy” and that “too many of our beautiful parks are being taken from us for the pleasure of a chosen few.”Sport England also objected to the proposals, saying it opposed “the granting of planning permission for any development which would lead to the loss of, or would prejudice the use of, all or any part of a playing field”.It pointed out that there are already four similar artificial turf pitches in the Exeter area, one of which is adjacent to the redevelopment site.The national sporting body, which funds the Exeter &amp;amp; Cranbrook Live &amp;amp; Move project, emphasised the fact that Exeter College had provided the Flowerpot Fields football pitches to compensate for the loss of playing fields at Countess Wear which the college had redeveloped for housing.Both the Environment Agency and Devon County Council, which is the Lead Local Flood Authority, also objected. They expressed concern about the impact the artificial pitch and pavilion could have on nearby flood defences.The site is in flood zones two and three, indicating medium and high flooding risk.The current River Exe defences were constructed in the 1970’s following a major 1960 flood which left more than 1,000 homes and businesses in Exwick, St Thomas and Alphington submerged.Six feet of water surged along Okehampton Street, just to the south of the redevelopment site.Environment Agency studies indicate that these defences would no longer be able to protect vulnerable parts of the city in a more extreme flood, and predicts that there is now a 1 in 100 chance of annual flooding in the city since climate change has made such events more likely.Environment Agency flood risk plan. Contains OS data © Crown copyright and EA data under OGLv3.The third generation (3G) artificial turf with which Exeter College proposes to replace the grass pitches has also been criticised for its environmental impact.By making the complex organic ecosystem of which soil is composed inaccessible at ground level it reduces biodiversity, undermining the important role played by grasslands in supporting wildlife.It is also frequently made using granulated waste tyres which contain lead, mercury and benzene. These chemicals impact the health and life expectancy of worms living in contaminated soil, with adverse consequences for all wildlife above them in the food chain.Artificial turf pitches also wear out quickly, with a lifespan of 8-10 years. Not only does UK not have any facilities to recycle them, the rubber granules and synthetic fibres of which they are made can leach into the environment.The high likelihood of flooding at the site increases the risk of chemicals and microplastics from the pitch being flushed into the River Exe and downstream into the estuary, which is an internationally important site for migrating birds.Artificial turf pitches even directly contribute to global warming, by reaching significantly greater temperatures than those reached by natural grass under the same meteorological conditions and depositing more energy into the atmosphere.Felling trees and replacing grasslands with artificial turf at Flowerpot Playing Fields will also diminish habitats and foraging grounds that are vital to local wildlife.A wide variety of birds and mammals are regularly sighted in the area including green woodpeckers, swifts, goldfinches and bats.Earlier this month patrons at the Mill on Exe, a pub facing the playing fields across the river, were treated to the spectacle of a female otter and her kits playing in the weir.Local resident Andy Cain said it was “an area where migrating swifts feed in early summer” which later becomes “a habitat for bees feeding on clover that grows there”.He described the plan to replace the green space with “plastic and fencing” as “another terrible idea”.An ecological assessment submitted with the redevelopment proposals nevertheless describes the area as having “negligible ecological importance”.Unsurprisingly, most expressions of support for Exeter College’s plans have come from the city’s rugby community.Tony Rowe, chairman of Exeter Chiefs rugby club, said that the college’s investment in rugby facilities would have a positive impact on the game in Exeter and across the region.Ian Guy of Topsham rugby club said the proposed artificial pitch “would resolve issues for a number of local sporting clubs”, saying it would “deliver much more access to sport from a limited area”.Members of Exeter Saracens and Exeter Athletic rugby club also supported the proposals, saying that the growing numbers of rugby players in the city mean that current facilities are inadequate.

However objections from residents and statutory consultees significantly outnumber those in favour. Comments submitted by Kim Westcott are typical of the views of many residents:“Flowerpot playing field is a popular green public space enjoyed by many people of all ages all year round.“I am shocked and saddened to hear that it could be replaced by [artificial turf], fencing and floodlights.“Not only would this impact badly on people’s health and well being, to lose this space the environmental damage would be huge.“At a time when we should be preserving green spaces I cannot believe that Exeter City Council is even considering felling mature trees and destroying wildlife habitats only to replace them with carcinogenic, non-recyclable plastic.”The strength of opposition to its plans has prompted Exeter College to pause for thought. Will it change course or is it determined to pursue them?Exeter City Council is expected to determine its application in due course."

"content" : "Exeter City Council holds its annual meeting each May, when the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor are appointed and the council leader for the following year is confirmed. Appointments to all the council’s committees are also made.Notwithstanding the resignation of several Labour councillors and the party’s loss of three seats to the Greens at the local elections, this week’s annual meeting confirmed that Labour councillor Phil Bialyk continues as city council leader.Speaking at the meeting he said he had recently reminded Green Party councillor Diana Moore, who is now opposition co-leader, that “democracy was the subjugation of the minority by the majority”.This followed a claim he made last week, published as council news then used as a headline by Devon Live, that “the overwhelming majority” voted for Labour at the elections on 5 May.However just under 20,000 votes were cast for Labour while nearly 24,000 were cast for the other parties combined, although the First Past the Post electoral system meant Labour won twelve of seventeen seats.Comparing proportional ballot shares for the leading candidate in each party in wards in which more than one councillor was elected (of which there were four this year) to mitigate the effects of some voters casting two votes yields very similar results: just under 46% of ballots were cast for Labour while just over 54% were cast for other parties.The party’s largest vote share in annual city council elections for which records are available was in 2016, when the ward boundaries had just changed and all the council’s seats were elected at the same time.It received just over 47.5% of the votes that were cast that year. It has received a minority of votes in every annual city council election since 2000.The council leader’s intentions were apparently magnanimous, although his party’s supporters are, in fact, a minority subjugating the majority.He said he recognised that not everybody had voted Labour and reminded the council’s annual meeting that “democracy is not always getting your own way”.(His party’s supporter’s are also among a larger minority — of voters subjugating a majority of non-voters. Nearly two-thirds of Exeter’s 92,000 electors did not vote on 5 May.)The council leader nevertheless appointed Labour members to all thirteen council committee chairs.These include Emma Morse, who holds the executive portfolio for city development. She was appointed to the planning committee chair despite Local Government Association guidance which explicitly advises against the development portfolio holder holding any seat on this committee.The council leader also continues to sit on the planning committee in defiance of the same guidance.This practice has apparently become ingrained in Exeter: the description of Emma Morse’s portfolio on the formal appointments notice was “City Development and Chair of Planning Committee”.Exeter City Council 2022-23 executive portfolio holders and non-executive member champions (top left to right): Naima Allock, Martin Pearce, Josie Parkhouse, Barbara Denning, Duncan Wood, Zion Lights, Amal Ghusain, Emma Morse, Phil Bialyk, Laura Wright, Ruth Williams.Labour committee chair appointments have most significance, however, in the party’s control of council decision-making scrutiny.This extends to Labour members chairing not only all the council’s scrutiny committees but also the private board which controls which topics are subject to scrutiny, effectively wielding a veto over the process.According to statutory government guidance, the council’s scrutiny function is intended to act as a “check and balance on the executive”, which is one reason why executive members are not permitted to hold seats on scrutiny committees.The guidance also says: “The executive should not try to exercise control over the work of the scrutiny committee”, and that all council “members and officers should recognise and appreciate the importance and legitimacy the scrutiny function is afforded by the law”.Exeter City Council’s auditor Grant Thornton recently reflected this view when it cited the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee as a model for council scrutiny.It said the committee’s key characteristic is that “it is chaired by a member of the official opposition and its members, of all political parties, are required to demonstrate robust challenge”.  Notable 2022-23 city council appointment updates      Bob Foale, David Harvey, Rachel Sutton and Ollie Pearson are no longer executive members    David Harvey resigned from the Labour party immediately after the election and now sits as an independent    Ollie Pearson resigned before the election and gave up his seat    Josie Parkhouse and Martin Pearce both join the executive; he will also chair the community grants panel    Rob Hannaford now chairs the strategic scrutiny committee, replacing Barbara Denning who also joins the executive    Anne Jobson replaces Andrew Leadbetter as Conservative group leader    Amy Sparling will represent the Progessive Group on Devon County Council’s Exeter Highways and Traffic Orders Committee  In order to fulfil the intended executive “check and balance” function of council scrutiny, legislation confers enhanced powers on councillors who sit on scrutiny committees.These include additional rights to access exempt or confidential information that extend their existing information access rights as councillors as well as their common law rights under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.Scrutiny committees are entitled to look at any issue which affects “the area or the area’s inhabitants”, offering a broad remit to intervene.They can require councillors and council officers to attend and give evidence and can also call representatives of external bodies to give evidence and supply information.Recommendations made under scrutiny powers require substantive responses and implementation within specified timescales and cannot simply be “noted” by council executives.Perhaps most important is the power scrutiny councillors have to “call in” executive decisions, delaying implementation to subject them to greater scrutiny, with the option to recommend that they are reconsidered and potentially overturned.Exeter City Council 2022-23 opposition progressive group members (left to right): Diana Moore, Carol Bennett, Jemima Moore, Tess Read, Catherine Rees, Amy Sparling, Kevin Mitchell, Michael Mitchell.However these powers are being circumvented by Exeter City Council’s approach to decision-making.Instead of the council’s executive committee taking decisions as required by the legislation which governs it, most of its decisions are instead taken by the full council.At first sight this appears more democratic, but actually has the effect of preventing the exercise of scrutiny powers and undermining the “check and balance on the executive” that the council’s scrutiny function is supposed to provide.This is what happened when the council apparently breached the regulations in its decision to send its chief executive and another senior director to work for Exeter City Futures for a total of five days a week while continuing to receive their council salaries.It also apparently breached this and other accountability and transparency regulations in a sequence of decisions regarding Exeter City Living, its private property development company, as well as its decision to purchase and redevelop the Guildhall shopping centre at an expected cost of £55 million.Decisions taken in breach of the regulations may be unlawful and ineffective, could constitute maladministration and may be subject to judicial review, putting the council’s finances at risk.2022-23 Lord Mayor Yolonda Henson with Deputy Lord Mayor Rob Newby. She has chosen Exeter Dementia Action Alliance as her official charity.The contrast between Exeter City Council and Devon County Council in their approaches to decision-making is instructive. Both councils are governed by the same decision-making legislation but only one appears to be implementing it correctly.The county council’s April forward plan listed 30 prospective decisions of which all but three were to be taken by the cabinet (the count council’s equivalent of the city council’s executive).At the same time the city council’s forward plan listed 52 prospective decisions of which just nine were to be taken by the executive.The city council’s approach entails that what we might call the overwhelming majority of the decisions it takes are not subject to scrutiny in the way the legislation and guidance requires.This is the very same legislation and guidance which Labour councillors recently invoked at County Hall in order to challenge a Conservative county cabinet decision which they believed should be subject to greater scrutiny.

Changes proposed by council leader Phil Bialyk at his first executive meeting after being elected leader in 2019 swept away the city council’s previous approach to scrutiny, which had been praised by the Local Government Association just two years before.It is now time for the city council to rethink its scrutiny practices and adopt new arrangements which not only comply with the letter, but also the spirit, of the law.This would involve correctly implementing local authority decision-making legislation so scrutiny committee members are empowered to perform their intended role as a “check and balance on the executive”.It would also involved ceding the chairs of scrutiny committees, including the private oversight board, to opposition councillors to help safeguard the council against decisions which put its finances at risk.Labour holds a commanding majority on Exeter City Council notwithstanding its recent losses, occupying 26 of 39 seats.Why, in such circumstances, would it remain resistant to more effective scrutiny of its decisions?"

"content" : "Exeter Green Party has taken three seats from Labour in the 2022 city council elections, reducing the ruling party majority as its eleventh year in power begins.The Conservative Party lost Topsham to Labour despite possessing a 23% vote share majority after increasing its share in the previous two elections. Newly-elected Labour councillor Joshua Ellis-Jones won by more than 250 votes, to the surprise of all involved.The Labour gain offset the party’s losses to the Greens to leave it with a reduced majority of thirteen seats.Liberal Democrat Kevin Mitchell held his Duryard &amp;amp; St James seat, increasing the party vote share by more than 10% to frustrate Labour hopes of repeating its 2021 victory in the ward.The Green Party now holds the same number of seats on the council as the Conservatives.The Progressive Group, formed by the Greens, Liberal Democrats and Independent Jemima Moore in 2019, has replaced the Conservatives as the official opposition on the city council.Tess Read won in St David’s for the Green Party, increasing its majority in the ward, which has now elected three Green councillors in three years.St David’s, which covers most of the city centre and is witness to extremes of wealth with poverty, has borne the brunt of a range of unpopular council policies.These include allowing unbridled university expansion to affect housing availability and affordability and promoting city centre vehicle use despite air quality and public realm impacts.The ward is also at the centre of the council’s controversial Liveable Exeter property development scheme.Both Catherine Rees and Carol Bennett won for the Greens in Heavitree, which elected two councillors following the resignation of Labour’s Chris Buswell.It was the city’s closest contest in 2021, when Catherine Rees lost by just sixteen votes.This year both polled 200 votes more than the third-place Labour candidate.Turnout in the ward was again highest in the city, at 47%, nearly 17% greater than in Labour stronghold Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton.Labour’s Matt Vizard, who had appeared vulnerable in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s after the Green Party came close to ousting incumbent Richard Branston last year, slightly increased his party’s majority to hold on to the seat.There were much larger vote share changes elsewhere in the city, with big swings both for and against Labour as well as the 10% Duryard &amp;amp; St James vote share change that meant Kevin Mitchell kept his seat.Naima Allock consolidated her 2021 election victory in Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton by increasing her party’s vote share by more than 16% to the highest in the city at nearly 62%, 800 votes ahead of the Conservative in second place.But deputy council leader Laura Wright came close to losing in St Thomas, where she was defending the largest Labour majority in the city, when Liberal Democrat Adrian Fullam increased his party’s vote share by nearly 15% to come within 44 votes of unseating her.And while Labour increased its vote share in Exwick, also electing two councillors following a Labour resignation, ex-deputy council leader Rachel Sutton, who was first elected in 2010 and is executive member with responsibility for Exeter decarbonisation, will only serve a one year term after coming second in the ballot behind newcomer Paul Knott.She will have to stand again next year if she wants to stay on the council.It isn’t clear whether this result is a reflection of her constituent’s views of the council’s net zero policies or simply a consequence of her name appearing at the bottom of ballot papers which present candidates in alphabetical surname order.In Priory Labour incumbent Tony Wardle, who has been on the council for fourteen years, also came second.He was beaten by party colleague Marina Asvachin, who is also county councillor for Wonford &amp;amp; St Loye’s.Her name appeared first and his last on the ballot papers. She has been elected for a four year term, he for two years.There were also vote share swings against the Conservatives of more than 9% in Alphington, Heavitree and St Thomas, nearly 10% in Pennsylvania and nearly 13% in Exwick and Topsham.Despite these, the party still received 23% of the ballots cast, just over half Labour’s nearly 46%. Labour nevertheless won twelve seats and the Conservatives just one.The Greens received a slightly lower ballot share than the Conservatives yet won three seats, and the Liberal Democrat’s 13% ballot share was 10% less than the Conservative’s but the two parties both won a single seat.Other vote share swings across the city significantly favoured the Greens, Labour and the Liberal Democrats in ways that are not reflected in the results, as well as in ways which are.Notwithstanding the extent to which the First Past the Post electoral system encourages electoral strategies which amplify such effects, this year’s Exeter local election results suggest the city’s political landscape is in flux, with more change to come.Methodology noteExeter City Council elections in wards in which more than one seat is being elected are held using the multiple non-transferable vote system.In such wards each voter is allowed to cast up to the number of votes which equals the number of seats being elected.These votes are not ranked in any order of preference.In such circumstances, because not all voters cast all of their votes, and because previous ward elections typically involve only a single seat, comparing vote shares over time is misleading.In 2016 all the council’s seats were exceptionally elected at the same time, following boundary changes. Then in Priory in 2019 and in Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton last year voters were invited to cast up to two votes to elect two councillors at the same time.This year four wards elected two councillors, with voters in Exwick, Heavitree, Pennsylvania and Priory each allowed to cast up to two votes.Comparing party performance in Exeter City Council elections over time is further complicated because not all the main parties stand candidates in all wards at every election.In particular, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats stood aside for each other in six wards last year, after the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats stood aside for independent candidate Jemima Moore in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s in 2019.In wards electing more than one councillor we therefore calculate a proportional share of the ballots cast for the leading candidate in each party to compare party support between each year and the preceding year or years in which they stood at least one candidate in that ward.We believe this is the best way to make statistically meaningful comparisons between the major parties in the city.The chart above compares this ballot share approach with a similar approach which also factors in the size of the electorate each year, and the more typical all votes share approach which produces results whose accuracy fluctuates as a function of the number of wards in which more than one councillor being elected.As three councillors were elected in each of thirteen wards in 2016, then one each in 2018, then more than one each in 2019, 2021 and 2022, the all votes share has been equal to the ballot share in only one of the past five elections.Candidates from other parties, as well as independent candidates, have also stood in each of these elections.UKIP contested most, but not all, of the city’s wards in 2016 and again in 2019, but not in 2018. The Women’s Equality Party also stood in Duryard &amp;amp; St James in 2018, 2019 and 2021. And an independent candidate stood in St Thomas this year and in the previous two years.These candidates are grouped together to simplify comparison. Where more than one non-major party stands in a multiple non-transferable vote election the best performing candidate is included in the analysis.Mid-year by-elections are excluded altogether."

SKETCHESLEADERLESS BY DESIGN?Devon County Council’s plan to delay taking action on decarbonisation, otherwise known as the Devon Carbon Plan, continues to achieve its aim as (bear with us) the county council cabinet responds to its consultation on its response to the Devon Climate Assembly’s responses to the subset of Interim Devon Carbon Plan issues it has successfully avoided confronting.County Hall has so far spent three years talking with other regional stakeholders instead of taking necessary actions of which many only it, as the county’s transport authority, is capable.Its latest contribution to the process is to agree that winds farms “can be part of providing Devon’s energy needs”, that the county “needs better active and public transport infrastructure” which “should be more affordable and convenient” and that “much more must be done to support people to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes and businesses”.Anyone wondering how it has taken the county council three years to grasp these insights need only look at the Devon Carbon Plan’s slippery delivery timetable.When the county council convened the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group in April 2019 it said it would “act now to tackle [the] climate emergency”, before scheduling the completed Devon Carbon Plan for adoption by November the following year.Postponement has since followed postponement, as well as a decision to scrap the planned principal public consultation, apparently made to speed up the process.Last month’s update: “We remain on schedule to have the Devon Carbon Plan available for organisations to consider adopting from the end of August 2022”.BUSES STOPExeter’s Labour county councillors successfully lobbied County Hall to convene an unscheduled meeting of the Exeter Highways and Traffic Orders Committee (HaTOC) three weeks ago to discuss the state of bus services in the city.The “emergency bus crisis hearing”, as it was described by Exeter Labour, confirmed that the party remains outside the room on local transport policy, but it nevertheless got plenty of local media coverage during the pre-election period.MORE TALK LESS ACTIONThe county council has derived more surprising new insights from the second phase of a consultation on the impact of traffic in Heavitree and Whipton.Cabinet member Stuart Hughes, who is responsible for highway management, said it had shown “that people feel that traffic does impact on their local neighbourhood.”A council press release summarised the consultation’s findings as “traffic has a negative effect on the attractiveness of the area, walking and cycling is not given priority over cars and other traffic [and] parking significantly contributes to pollution.”It’s only eighteen months since the first phase of the consultation began. The county council’s next steps? Convene another meeting of Exeter HaTOC to talk about the results.BROWNFIELD OR GREEN?In Exeter Digest #11 we reported on the first of four “scrutiny” meetings being orchestrated by the city council to air Exeter City Futures’ ideas about using Exeter as an urban guinea pig for its development fund project.At last week’s second meeting it was Frazer Osment’s turn to play the ringer. His firm LDA Design is responsible for the sketches that currently constitute the published Liveable Exeter “vision”, as he said.He nevertheless omitted to mention that it is also in partnership with Global City Futures, Exeter City Futures’ parent company, at West Exe Business Park, a 60-acre greenfield development on the edge of the city.The “eco-friendly” development’s first major announcement was the construction of a roundabout to improve site access from the A379.The Exeter City Futures sales pitch continued at the meeting despite the company still not providing the documents on which their proposals are based. Councillors from across the political spectrum understandably voiced their displeasure at being told instead of shown.The company first said the Cabinet Office wouldn’t let them release the documents, then said that it wanted to sell the idea to stakeholders before letting anyone else see the details, then came up with the pre-election period as their excuse for non-disclosure - apparently a council suggestion.Meanwhile a freedom of information request submitted by Exeter Observer for the documents fifteen weeks ago has yielded similar results.

Being honest and owning up to mistakes came top.FOIA YOUThe House of Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee has published its latest report on the infamous Cabinet Office “clearing house” set up to circumvent transparency laws and block freedom of information requests from journalists.The committee found “evidence of poor FOI administration in the Cabinet Office and across government which appears to be inconsistent with the spirit and principles of the FOIA” and “evidence which questions the processes currently being undertaken within government for determining public interest decisions” as well as “concerns about political involvement” in what is supposed to be a statutory information request process.Committee chair William Wragg added: “As FOI policy owner and coordinating department the Cabinet Office should be championing transparency across government, but its substandard FOI handling and failure to provide basic information about the working of the coordinating body has had the opposite effect.”The report’s recommendations include an audit of the Cabinet Office freedom of information “clearing house” to “reassure the public that the government’s approach to freedom of information requests is compliant with the Freedom of Information Act”.Meanwhile Reporters Without Borders has published its 2022 World Press Freedom Index.

"content" : "Three weeks ago we embarked on a 2022 local elections series aimed at providing a much-needed counterbalance to the mix of cheerleading and churnalism that is often delivered by Exeter’s media when it comes to local politics.We looked at previous and current election campaign claims made by Exeter Labour, which will have been in control of the city council for ten straight years by election day on 5 May.This will make it what the Electoral Reform Society calls a “one party council” with “weak electoral accountability” which greatly increases the likelihood of cronyism, corruption and spending decisions which offer poor value for public money.In part one we focussed on the city’s housing crisis, debunking the party’s claims around housing delivery, publicly-funded developments on council land and the provision of affordable housing, outlining the impact of university expansion on the city’s residential housing stock.In part two we looked at the city centre and Exeter’s wider economy including its claims about St Sidwell’s Point, which cost £44 million — more than double its original £19.2 million budget — without kickstarting the wider site redevelopment that was promised.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            We also assessed Exeter Labour’s misuse of economic indicators to make unfounded claims about local wages and business vitality, and its misrepresentation of content marketing materials as authoritative sources of information about the city.In part three we examined the party’s claims about climate crisis leadership, renewable energy, recycling, retrofitting and development standards as well as decisions to scrap council and city decarbonisation goals.We also assessed last year’s attendance figures for public council meetings as a measure of councillor commitment to their constituents and yesterday published a guide to who’s standing where in the city, wards to watch, what the results might look like and what they might mean.As last year we’re offering a rolling results service complete with graphical analysis of vote shares and swings as the winners and losers are announced on the night.Follow us @exeterobserver to stay in the loop and look out for our snap election results analysis on Friday.Our scrutiny of the party in power concludes on election eve with a coda examining Exeter Labour’s claim that the city has one of the lowest rates of council tax in the country.It has repeatedly made this claim in its campaign materials and election manifestos for the past seven years. In its 2021 manifesto it pledged this would continue and repeated the claim in its 2022 election campaign leaflets, although tax is not mentioned at all in the party’s 2022-23 manifesto.When comparing council tax levels across the country it is important not only to distinguish between different types of council but also to consider other factors which may make local authority statutory services more or less expensive to deliver, and council tax bills likely to be correspondingly higher or lower.There are currently 333 principal local authorities in England of five different types: London boroughs, metropolitan authorities, unitary authorities, district councils and county councils.Most of the country is divided into two tier areas in which responsibility for council services is split between a district and county council.The rest are single tier authorities which deliver all council services (except passenger transport in London and metropolitan areas).Notwithstanding its name, and unlike Plymouth City Council which is a unitary authority, Exeter City Council is a second tier district council which is responsible for a subset of the Exeter public services which are funded by council tax payments.These include refuse and recycling collection, planning, licensing and environmental health policy and enforcement, leisure services and council tax collection.Devon County Council is responsible for education, highways, transport and strategic planning, passenger transport, social care and waste management. This is why 75% of the council tax collected by the city council (£1,556 of a band D bill this year) is spent by the county council.Exeter council tax bills also contribute to the cost of Devon fire and rescue services, which take 5% (£92 this year), and police services, which take 12% (£247 this year). Exeter City Council takes 8% or £170 of a 2022-23 band D bill.Geographic and demographic variations between councils as well as other factors mean that their public service delivery costs vary widely.Exeter City Council covers among the smallest council areas in the country at just over 4,700 hectares. It is only just over 4% of the size of West Devon, which at nearly 116,000 hectares is among the country’s largest.At the same time Exeter’s population density is amongst the highest in the country, and is more than 58 times the density in West Devon.These factors make many second tier council services much cheaper to deliver in Exeter than West Devon and many other district council areas.Exeter’s current council tax band D household charge is £2,065.Is this among the lowest rates in the country? No. Westminster is lowest at £886 and Rutland highest at £2,300, with an average rate of £1,966.Exeter’s band D charge is also higher than all but one of London’s boroughs (Kingston upon Thames), 38 of 59 unitaries and 24 of 36 metropolitan authorities.But Rutland is a unitary authority, responsible for all the services provided in Exeter by the city and county council combined, while Westminster is a London borough, responsible for all these services except transport.If we exclude London boroughs and unitary authorities as well as metropolitan authorities and county councils, among second tier districts in England the highest council tax band D charge is £2,281 in Lewes (with West Devon fourth highest) while the lowest is £1,863 in Basingstoke &amp;amp; Deane.The charge in Exeter is also above the district average of £2,041.

Subscribe freeIt is only by restricting the comparison to the small portion of the charge taken by second tier district councils from total household bills in their areas that Exeter can claim to be further down the national charges table.However, 33 of the other 180 second tier district councils still receive less than Exeter City Council from their portion of their area bills: Breckland is lowest at £105. Exeter City Council’s £170 share of the city’s band D charge is lower than the average of £203 but, as we have seen, Exeter’s small size and high population density means we should expect it to be.In normative fact-checking terminology Exeter Labour’s election campaign claim is therefore mostly false: it may contain a kernel of truth but leaves out facts which would produce a different conclusion."

Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2019There are 39 seats on Exeter City Council. Each of thirteen electoral wards of between 6,500 and 7,800 electors is represented by three councillors.A third of the seats, one in each ward, is normally contested in each of three years, with county council elections held in the fourth year. Each city councillor thus normally serves a four year term.Exeter’s wards have been arranged this way since boundary changes prompted the exceptional election of the whole council at the same time in 2016, using the multiple non-transferable vote system.This year voters in four of Exeter’s wards will elect an additional councillor by casting up to two votes on their ballot papers: three Labour councillors have resigned and a fourth died in office.In each of the Exwick, Heavitree and Pennsylvania wards the candidate who receives the largest number of votes will be elected for a four year term and the runner-up for a one year term. In the Priory ward the runner-up will be elected for a two year term.This means seventeen seats are being contested this year: Labour is defending fourteen of them, the Conservatives two and the Liberal Democrats one.Labour strongholds However the ruling party has little to worry about: it only needs to win six of the seventeen to retain control of the city council as it already holds fourteen of the 22 seats that are not being contested this year.Exwick, Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton, Priory and St Thomas are all Labour strongholds, where the party won by margins of at least 15% of the vote last year after little recent change in party vote distribution. Popular councillor Laura Wright, who is also deputy council leader, is defending a Labour majority of nearly a quarter of the vote in St Thomas, the largest margin in the city.As Exwick and Priory are both electing two councillors, Labour only has to successfully defend its strongholds to retain control of the council. Council executive member Rachel Sutton is expected to retain her seat in Exwick and Labour councillor Tony Wardle is expected to retain his in Priory.Paul Knott and Marina Asvachin, who is already a member of the county council, hope to join them on the city council in these wards.Naima Allcock, who was elected to represent Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton for a one year term in 2021 following the death of Judy Pattison, is also expected to successfully defend her seat.PennsylvaniaLabour also won in Pennsylvania with a margin of nearly 24% last year, where high-profile pro-nuclear campaigner Zion Lights won a larger share of the vote than council leader Phil Bialyk in her first election.The party’s vote share rose by more than 16% compared with 2019 in a ward which had been a two-way Conservative/Liberal Democrat contest until the 2016 boundary changes.Pennsylvania is also electing two councillors following the death of deputy Lord Mayor Ian Quance. While Labour are expected to win one seat, previous results suggest the Liberal Democrats may win the other.Liberal Democrat candidate Nigel Williams, who increased the party’s vote share by nearly 14% last year, is standing again this year. The Conservative vote share in the ward has been falling steadily since the 2016 boundary changes, down nearly 10% over the period, putting the Liberal Democrats on course to overtake them into second place.The Greens did not stand in the ward in 2021 as part of an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats, despite polling 24% of the vote in the previous contest.However as there eight candidates on the ballot and each elector’s two votes are not cast in order of preference, vote distribution may produce unexpected results.Duryard &amp;amp; St JamesAdjacent Duryard &amp;amp; St James is also difficult to call. Labour councillor Martin Pearce frustrated Liberal Democrat hopes of three wins in a row there last year by increasing the party’s vote share by nearly 15%, beating Liberal Democrat Will Aczel by a margin of 7.5%.As in Pennsylvania the Greens, who polled 12% in 2019,  did not field a candidate. At the same time Women’s Equality Party candidate Bea Gare took 7.5% of the vote, slightly more than the margin by which Martin Pearce won. She is not standing this year.The ward turnout was also the lowest in the city at 32.45%, possibly reflecting the absence of many of the students who now dominate it.This year Liberal Democrat Kevin Mitchell, who was first elected to the council in 2003, is defending the seat in a four-way contest. He is co-leader of the Progressive group on the council with Green Party councillor Diana Moore.The other group members are Liberal Democrat Michael Mitchell, who also represents Duryard &amp;amp; St James, community campaigner Jemima Moore, who won a landslide in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s in 2019 as an independent candidate after the council closed Clifton Hill sports centre and earmarked the site for redevelopment, and Green Party councillor Amy Sparling, who was elected to represent St David’s last year.Since its formation the group has presented much of the effective opposition to Exeter City Council’s ruling Labour group despite the Conservative group being slightly larger.Green Party bridgeheads Exeter’s key electoral battlegrounds are central wards which contain some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country and have also borne the brunt of a range of unpopular council policies.These include allowing the unbridled expansion of the university to adversely affect residential housing availability and affordability and promoting city centre vehicle use despite its impact on air quality and the public realm.Heavitree is the city’s most marginal ward. The Green Party’s Catherine Rees came within sixteen votes of winning there last year, a margin of just 0.005%, after increasing the party’s vote share by nearly 26% in the closest contest in the city in the ward with the highest turnout, at 46.7%.She is standing again this year as the party’s lead candidate alongside Green Party colleague Carol Bennett in a ward which will also elect two councillors.Last year’s second closest contest saw 126 votes separate Labour from the Greens in adjacent Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s. Support for Labour incumbent Richard Branston fell by more than 12% as Dan Grey increased the Green Party’s vote share by more than 30% from 2018, after the party stood aside for independent Jemima Moore in 2019.The Green Party’s Andy Ketchin is fighting a tight two-way contest with Labour’s Matt Vizard there this year. The Conservatives came a distant third in 2021.St David’sSt David’s is Exeter’s most complex electoral ward. It covers most of the city centre, juxtaposing tourist hotspots including the quay with ex-industrial areas and part of the Riverside valley park.Significant development is planned there as part of the Liveable Exeter scheme, where the Labour administration is already very unpopular for, among other things, approving the redevelopment of the Harlequins shopping centre for co-living despite promising not to build any more student accommodation on council land.Labour has a history of giving up on St David’s: Lewis Keen was elected there in 2016 when still a student before moving to London to take up a job in 2018, returning only to attend just enough full council meetings to avoid disqualification.And Labour’s Robert Lamb, who was also elected to represent the ward in 2016, was absent without submitting apologies from thirteen of seventeen meetings at which he was expected in 2020-21 following an attendance record of 39% the previous year.He was disqualified from the city council a fortnight before last year’s local elections were held.Tess Read is the Green Party’s candidate in St David’s this year. She is up against Labour’s Jakir Hussain as Luke Sills is standing down after representing the ward for six years.Should the Greens win three of the four seats that are being contested in Exeter’s central battlegrounds the Progressive group will overtake the Conservative group as the principal city council opposition, regardless of the outcome in Duryard &amp;amp; St James and Pennsylvania.Should it win all four it will equal the Conservatives as the largest opposition party on the council in its own right.Conservative bastions Exeter Conservatives’ prospects in this year’s elections appear more predictable, notwithstanding the party’s current national standing. They currently hold all three seats in both Topsham and St Loye’s.Keith Sparkes is defending a Conservative majority of 23% of the vote in Topsham after the party increased its share there in the last two elections, and Peter Holland is defending St Loye’s after coming within twenty votes of taking the Wonford &amp;amp; St Loye’s county council seat from Labour’s Marina Asvachin last year.Labour’s Olwen Foggin stood down in Heavitree to contest St Loye’s in 2021. She lost to Conservative councillor Anne Jobson, who has reinvigorated the Conservative group since being elected, but achieved Labour’s biggest vote share in the ward since the 2016 boundary changes.This year Labour’s Jane Begley has similarly vacated her seat in Pennsylvania to contest the ballot in St Loye’s, after her council meetings attendance fell sharply in the second half of her four year term, in what may be an elegant form of protest at the direction her party has taken in the city.Pinhoe, AlphingtonWere it not for the Conservative party’s current national public opinion nadir, the local party would have had higher hopes in Pinhoe, where Cynthia Thompson is standing. A former Lord Mayor, she represented the ward from 2008 to 2012 then again from 2015 to 2019.There has been a close two-way race between Labour and the Conservatives in Pinhoe for over a decade. In 2010 Labour won the seat by just four votes. In 2016, when all three seats were elected at the same time, Labour took two and the Conservatives one, with less than a hundred votes separating all three winning candidates.Having beaten Labour’s David Harvey by just six votes to win the seat in a by-election in 2015, Cynthia Thompson lost to the current Labour Lord Mayor, Trish Oliver, in 2019 by just fifteen votes, a margin of 0.6%.This year Duncan Wood is defending the seat for Labour, following a council decision to approve £100,000 of funding for a project – in which he was directly involved – outside the community grants budget.The decision got the council into hot water with its auditor and nearly landed it in court.Cynthia Thompson’s assiduous pursuit of the issue prompted a full investigation by the external auditor which found that while the council might have broken the law, the cost of taking it to court to clarify the matter would not have been justified in the circumstances.The council has nevertheless since formally floated the idea of giving the project another £1.3 million outside the community grants procedure despite its business plan still being incomplete more than five years after the council funded its development.Well-known Conservative John Harvey stood in the ward last year, when he lost to Labour councillor David Harvey.This year he is standing for the Conservatives in Alphington instead, where Labour executive member Bob Foale hopes to keep his seat despite a narrowing gap between the parties: last year Labour won by just 93 votes. The Conservatives’ national woes may also affect the outcome here.2021 elections: city vs countyIn 2021 Exeter Labour fought both city and county council elections in the first electoral test of Phil Bialyk’s party leadership.While Labour lost just one seat in the city council elections, to the Green Party’s Amy Sparling in St David’s, its performance was much more mixed than this single loss implies.In the county council elections it lost vote share in seven of nine divisions. The exceptions were in Duryard &amp;amp; Pennsylvania, where the party increased its vote share by just under 1%, and in Pinhoe &amp;amp; Mincinglake, where the party increased its share by a little over 2%.The Green Party, in contrast, gained the largest increase in vote share in every division in Exeter except Wonford &amp;amp; St Loye’s.Johanna Korndorfer, who is standing in Duryard &amp;amp; St James in this year’s city council elections, increased the party’s vote share by more than 12% in the county council St Sidwell’s &amp;amp; St James division, while Lizzie Woodman, who is standing in Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton this year, increased it by nearly 16% in Heavitree &amp;amp; Whipton Barton.And in St David’s &amp;amp; Haven Banks Andrew Bell, who is standing for the Greens in Alphington this year, won more than twice as many votes as the Conservative candidate, dramatically closing the gap on Labour’s Carol Whitton with a vote share increase of more than 19%.At the same time Conservative Percy Prowse and Andrew Leadbetter, who is Conservative group leader on the city council, held Duryard &amp;amp; Pennsylvania and Wearside &amp;amp; Topsham comfortably despite losing support in both divisions, primarily to the Greens.The Liberal Democrats’ best result in last year’s county council elections was third place in Duryard &amp;amp; Pennsylvania. In every other division they polled fewer votes than the Greens.Independent community campaigner Kate Jago notably polled nearly 7% of the vote in Pinhoe &amp;amp; Mincinglake in her first election.2022 elections: possible outcomesThis year’s elections provide a second city council-focussed test of Phil Bialyk’s leadership in the context of the recent simultaneous resignations of Labour’s Ollie Pearson and Chris Buswell as councillors in Exwick and Heavitree and Jane Begley’s decision to vacate Pennsylvania.None had attended more than half of the council meetings at which they were expected this year. Ollie Pearson only attended three of the fourteen meetings in which he was expected to participate. (Alys Martin, daughter of the late Ian Quance, also resigned.)The resignations alone have not caused sufficient unrest in the local party to lead to calls for Phil Bialyk to follow: a subsequent loss of several seats to the Greens might.If the Green Party emerges from these elections with the same number of seats as the Conservatives then the questions about his leadership that are currently being asked sotto voce across Exeter’s political spectrum will surely become a chorus.Nevertheless, whether Exeter Labour fares badly or well on Thursday it is a racing certainty that is will remain the city council’s ruling party as it heads into its eleventh year in power.The bigger pictureAcross the country 6,800 seats in 4,000 wards will be elected in 60 district councils, 33 metropolitan boroughs and 21 unitary authorities in every region of England as well as 32 London Boroughs and 22 Welsh and 32 Scottish councils at this year’s local elections.100 councils will elect all their councillors, six will elect half and 94 (Exeter among them) will elect one third of their councillors.There will also be six local authority and one metropolitan mayoral elections, a referendum in Bristol on whether to keep its mayor and the Northern Ireland Assembly elections which could have far-reaching consequences.Labour already holds half of the seats that are being elected in England, following its strongest showing in a decade at the 2018 local elections when many of the seats that are up this year were last contested.Notwithstanding its sustained national poll lead it will be hard for the party to advance across the country this week.TurnoutTurnout in recent English local elections is typically around 35%, although it was nearly 43% at last year’s Exeter local elections which combined the pandemic-postponed 2020 city council elections with elections for Devon County Council and the Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police &amp;amp; Crime Commissioner.When a general election is held on the same day as local elections turnout typically increases to 64%.Many factors contribute to low participation in elections, including increasing mistrust of politicians and the political system, the timing of polls and the First Past the Post electoral system, which has numerous disadvantages and is the object of active electoral reform campaigns.Just 15.73% of Exeter’s 92,000 registered electors voted for Labour at last year’s city council elections, while 21.48% voted for other parties. Labour nevertheless won eleven seats and the other parties three between them.The 2021 turnout was higher than in 2018 and 2019, but none of the elections held in Exeter using its current ward boundaries have involved more than 45% of the city’s voters.Assessing the representative effectiveness of First Past the Post elections in Exeter by ignoring non-voting electors reveals similarly skewed seat distributions.At the past four elections Exeter Labour has secured between 36.5% and 47.5% of the ballots cast but has, in every year except 2019, won at least 76.9% of the seats.A fundamental requirement of a democratic electoral system is to accurately represent the views of voters, but First Past the Post often fails to produce this outcome.It doesn’t even guarantee that the party which wins the most votes will win the most seats: in the 1951 UK general election the Labour Party famously polled nearly a quarter of a million more votes than the Conservatives but won 26 fewer seats, with the Conservatives subsequently forming the government.It also means some seats change hands so rarely that they become “safe” for particular parties, rendering voting preferences in such seats all but irrelevant.Around 60% of Parliament’s 650 seats are in this position, although recent national political realignments have begun to reduce this proportion.It favours large, well-financed, incumbent political parties which are capable of consistently high campaign spending across all electoral areas and are incentivised to resist changes to an electoral system which helps them win power with minority support and helps fund them when in opposition.How to voteYou must be on the electoral register in order to vote. Voter registration for these elections closed on 14 April.Everyone registered to vote should have received a poll card which says where their polling station is located. Electors who vote in person can only cast their ballots at the polling station specified on this card.The location of Exeter’s 55 polling stations, which will be open from 7am to 10pm on 5 May, can also be found by postcode search.Any voter who arrives at their polling station before 10pm and is in a queue waiting to vote at 10pm will be able to vote.On entering the polling station you (or your proxy) can show your poll card to the staff, or tell them your name and address instead.Despite popular perception to the contrary you do not need a poll card to vote, provided you are on the electoral register. Nor do you need to provide any personal identification to do so, as yet.You will then receive a ballot paper on which you can cast your vote(s) by marking a cross next to the candidate(s) you want to support in one of the available polling booths, before folding your ballot paper and placing it in a ballot box.Proxy voters – registered voters who have been appointed to vote on behalf of another elector – must also vote at the specified polling station unless they have instead made arrangements to vote by post.The deadline for ordinary proxy vote registrations had passed, but you may be able to apply to vote by emergency proxy due to disability or because of employment circumstances, in which case your application to do so must be submitted by 5pm on polling day.Applications for replacement spoilt or lost postal votes can also be submitted until 5pm on polling day.Postal voters can choose between returning their vote by post, in which case it must arrive by 10pm on polling day, or delivering it by hand either to the civic centre or any polling station in their city council ward before 10pm on polling day.Nearly one in five votes are usually cast by post in local elections. Around 17% of Exeter’s voters have taken up this option this year, as last.When all Exeter’s polling stations have closed, the city’s ballot boxes will be taken to the Riverside Leisure Centre so ballot papers can be verified and votes counted.Records of previous elections held in the city are also published by the city council.

Subscribe freeMethodological noteAs the 2016 city council elections were held using the multiple non-transferable vote system each voter was allowed to cast up to three votes which were not ranked in any order of preference.Because not all voters cast all three of their votes a precise vote share for individual candidates cannot be derived from the recorded results.This also applies to two individual ward elections held since then, in Priory in 2019 and Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton last year, when voters were invited to cast up to two votes to elect two councillors at the same time, as they will be in Exwick, Heavitree, Pennsylvania and Priory this year.Calculating comparative party vote shares in Exeter City Council elections over time is further complicated because the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats stood aside for independent candidate Jemima Moore in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s in 2019, then formed a cross-party alliance which led to them standing aside for each other in a total of six wards across the city last year.Consequently, a proportional share of the ballots cast for the leading candidate in each party in each ward in which the party stood has been used to compare party support in the principal city council elections that have taken place since 2016.This is the best available method to enable statistically meaningful comparisons between the major parties in the city. Mid-year by-elections have been excluded.Candidates from other parties, as well as independent candidates, have also stood in each of these elections.UKIP contested most, but not all, of the city’s wards in 2016 and again in 2019, but not in 2018. Bea Gare represented the Women’s Equality Party at city council elections in Duryard &amp;amp; St James in 2018, 2019 and 2021.These smaller parties and independent candidates have been grouped together to simplify comparison. Where more than one non-major party stood in a multiple non-transferable vote election the best performing candidate has been included in the analysis."

"content" : "A fortnight ago we embarked on a 2022 local elections series aimed at providing a much-needed counterbalance to the mix of cheerleading and churnalism that is often delivered by Exeter’s media when it comes to local politics.We looked at previous and current election campaign claims made by Exeter Labour, which will have been in control of the city council for ten straight years by election day on 5 May.This will make it what the Electoral Reform Society calls a “one party council” with “weak electoral accountability” which greatly increases the likelihood of cronyism, corruption and spending decisions which offer poor value for public money.In part one we focussed on the city’s housing crisis, debunking claims around housing delivery, publicly-funded developments on council land and the provision of affordable housing across the city, outlining the impact of university expansion on the city’s residential housing stock.In part two we looked at the city centre and Exeter’s wider economy, examining claims about St Sidwell’s Point, which has taken nearly ten years to build and cost £44 million — more than double its original £19.2 million budget — without catalysing the wider site redevelopment that was promised.We also assessed Exeter Labour’s misuse of economic indicators to make unfounded claims about local wages and business vitality, and its misrepresentation of content marketing materials as authoritative sources of information about the city.  “In May 2021, the people of Exeter put their faith in Labour. We made promises to you and we are delivering on those promises.”  2022 Exeter Labour local elections campaign leafletOur scrutiny of the party in power continues with an examination of its campaign claims about climate crisis leadership, renewable energy, recycling, retrofitting and development standards as well as decisions to scrap council and city decarbonisation goals.We asked Exeter Labour to respond to questions about these issues at the beginning of April, but it took more than a week to reply and still hasn’t provided any answers. We expected it to have the sources of its statements to hand, but it seems it does not.We haven’t scrutinised Exeter’s other parties the same way because they haven’t been making the decisions for the past ten years and their policy proposals and attempts at intervention are routinely rejected or ignored. It’s the “Labour-led council” we seek to hold to account here, in the public interest and in the public sphere.We’ve included the party’s 2022-23 manifesto enable you to peruse its position in full as we cannot address all of the many claims it makes.As last year, we’ll also publish an insider’s guide to who’s standing where in the city and what we might expect the results to look like, then offer a rolling results service complete with graphical analysis of vote shares and swings as the winners and losers are announced.Subscribe to our free newsletter or follow us @exeterobserver to stay in the loop.At the same time as Exeter Labour was putting the finishing touches to its 2022-23 manifesto last month, the IPCC was preparing the report of its sixth assessment (AR6) working group III for publication.The report provides an authoritative up to date assessment of global climate change mitigation progress and pledges, delivering a final warning for policy-makers. It says greenhouse gas emissions must peak within three years to give the world a chance of meeting the targets set by the Paris Agreement in 2015.Professor Jim Skea of Imperial College, who is a member of the UK Climate Change Committee and co-chair of the report working group said: “It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”UN secretary general António Guterres added: “Some government and business leaders are saying one thing – but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.”Unfortunately, as with Exeter’s housing situation and economic health, extreme scepticism is advised when it comes to Exeter Labour claims about the city’s climate crisis mitigation prospects.As recently as last year the party was maintaining its aim that Exeter would become “an energy independent city by 2025” in election campaign leaflets, while other campaign materials repeated a claim promoted by Exeter City Futures that Exeter had the lowest carbon footprint among UK towns and cities.A cursory glance at the details revealed numerous problems with the claim’s basis, but council leader Phil Bialyk and Labour councillors Matt Vizard, Duncan Wood, Marina Asvachin, Martin Pearce and Emma Morse all repeated it in turn.These included the finding that Exeter’s carbon footprint was 11.6 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent – a measure covering the seven main greenhouse gases) per person per annum. This would make the city’s total annual carbon footprint nearly 1.2 million tCO2e more than the 329,000 tCO2e accounted for in the Net Zero Exeter plan.Six months later Labour councillor Rachel Sutton, who is the executive member with responsibility for Net Zero Exeter 2030, nevertheless said that Exeter was “in the vanguard of this nationwide challenge” and was “one of the few councils in the country to have set out a road map that was both deliverable and practical”.Her comments followed a council press release in which it said it had put fighting climate change “at the top of its agenda”, quoting a pledge by council leader Phil Bialyk that the “ambition of creating a net zero carbon city by 2030 will be at the heart of everything the council does going forward”.This year’s Exeter Labour election manifesto and its party campaign leaflets all repeat the pledge despite Exeter’s decarbonisation plans scoring just 61% in the first national ranking of council climate action plans.Exeter scored higher than it would otherwise have done because its Net Zero Exeter plan was assessed in combination with the interim Devon Carbon Plan. Had the city’s plan been considered alone it would have fared worse still, particularly in key areas including goal definition, monitoring, evaluation, stakeholder involvement and communications.Almost all the actions proposed by the plan, which was produced by Exeter City Futures and adopted by the council in July last year, are framed as vaguely-defined activities, rather than focussed on specific outcomes, and very few include quantifiable measures of success. Dozens of these actions are supposed to be complete by the end of this year, yet almost none have begun.Despite this the city council and its partners continue to claim, repeatedly, in press releases and policy documents that the plan provides “a clear roadmap to carbon neutrality”.Last year’s Exeter Labour local elections manifesto echoes this claim, but this year’s manifesto doesn’t mention the plan at all.And it is now clear that the city council’s chief executive Karime Hassan (who now also works for Exeter City Futures) already viewed decarbonisation as a property development and capital investment opportunity when the council adopted the plan nearly two years ago.Exeter City Council Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan adoption decisionIt is also now clear that despite being panicked into verbally expressing support for carbon neutrality when first confronted by Exeter’s youth climate strikers in February 2019, Exeter Labour had a very limited understanding of what reducing the city’s carbon footprint to sustainable levels would actually involve.When then-Green Party councillor Chris Musgrave proposed a motion that the council declare a climate emergency a fortnight after the first school strike, Exeter Labour rejected it.His motion, seconded by Liberal Democrat Kevin Mitchell, committed Exeter to carbon neutrality by 2030, taking into account both production and consumption emissions, and set a deadline for the council to produce an initial climate mitigation strategy and action plan by August that year, also fixing subsequent progress review dates.However council leader Phil Bialyk, seconded by Labour councillor Rachel Sutton, removed all the references to a climate emergency and deleted most of the motion including the resolution to produce and implement an action plan.Exeter Labour then unaccountably proposed and passed its own climate emergency declaration motion instead, five months later.Bizarrely, Labour councillor David Harvey revisited this motion two years afterwards, in April last year, to declare an ecological emergency too. As the new motion added nothing of substance to the previous motion, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this use of council time was related to his campaign for re-election at the local elections the following week.The party may also have wanted to airbrush over its failure to get to grips with the climate crisis during the previous two years. It certainly made much of this motion in its 2021 manifesto and hasn’t missed the opportunity to mention it again in this year’s campaign leaflets and manifesto, where its belated climate emergency declaration features as a key achievement from last year.We might expect another, similar, motion next year too, for the same reason.Exeter’s global climate strike fills Bedford Street in September 2019.When Labour councillor David Harvey brought this motion forward, Green Party councillor Diana Moore and Liberal Democrat councillor Kevin Mitchell sought to amend it to include a carbon budget and annual audit for both the city and the city council, and to create a citizen’s assembly to better engage Exeter’s communities with the climate crisis.The Labour group voted both these proposals down, despite the primary recommendation of a September 2020 report by engineering consultants WSP commissioned by Exeter City Futures to review the Net Zero Exeter plan’s main goals.The report said that a baseline model of Exeter’s greenhouse gas emissions should be created to “allow better analysis and comparison of actions, as well as mapping of ‘business as usual’ and tracking of progress”. Its feedback included that “clarity would be useful on why goals are chosen” and that the overall carbon emissions reduction claims needed “recalculating”.Six months later, during COP26, Exeter’s Green Party councillors called for a city carbon budget again, based on a properly calculated baseline greenhouse gas emissions inventory and specifying the annual reductions required to meet its decarbonisation goals.They also called for an annual report demonstrating progress towards these goals and evaluating the contribution of the Net Zero Exeter plan towards them.The council agreed, but it emerged last month that it had quietly decided to exclude scope 3 emissions from the Exeter emissions baseline. The decision to do so was buried in the minutes of a council committee meeting.As scope 3 emissions may constitute as much as 50% or more of the city’s carbon footprint, partly because of its low levels of carbon-intensive industrial activity, this decision has effectively ensured the city will not meet its “Net Zero Exeter 2030” goal.Production vs consumption based emissions by category from The Future Of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World, University of Leeds, ARUP &amp;amp; C40 CitiesBizarrely the council told us that it had excluded these emissions from the city’s carbon plans on the basis of the decision councillors had made to commission the Exeter emissions baseline inventory, despite neither of the decisions taken by councillors to commission a carbon budget mentioning any such exclusion.The council refused to say who had selectively interpreted these decisions this way.However in March last year the council’s chief executive Karime Hassan had expressed doubt that the council would be able to “deliver carbon neutral aspirations for Exeter by 2030”.Several potential causes for the delivery failure risk were identified, including the “political environment”, the “economics of carbon reduction” and “behavioural challenges”.They also included the council’s “technical capability to deliver”, “lack of control over all stakeholders” and “failure to engage with residents and businesses of Exeter to ensure solutions proposed meet real need”.The council says it thinks of itself as a “municipal entrepreneur, ring master and story teller”, so perhaps it is in this mode that it selectively interpreted the decisions about Exeter’s decarbonisation goals made by councillors on our behalf.It seems also to have selectively interpreted its commitment to the so-called “Exeter Vision 2040”, which includes being “recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”.Somerset West and Taunton Council came top of the Climate Emergency UK council climate action plan rankings with a score of 92% partly because its comprehensive carbon reduction and climate change resilience action plan includes scope 3 emissions.It seems to be “leading the way on climate change and the green agenda” among UK councils, notwithstanding MP Ben Bradshaw’s claim that Exeter’s Labour council is doing so in the party’s 2022 election campaign leaflets.Typology of climate delay discourses. Source: Discourses of climate delay under CC BY 4.0 license.Exeter City Council hasn’t even got a grip on its own carbon footprint. When council leader Phil Bialyk deleted most of Chris Musgrave’s climate emergency motion in February 2019, he claimed to be “on track to deliver an energy-neutral council by 2022”, a claim that Exeter Labour repeated in its election campaign leaflets the same year.But in September last year the council decided to scrap its ostensible goal of achieving carbon neutral operations by 2022, not only on the basis that it was deemed “unachievable” but also that the council hadn’t actually passed a resolution to achieve it in the first place.This goal had been on the council’s risk register since November 2019, since when it had been repeatedly reviewed. It seems the council had been confusing its energy policy with a non-existent corporate decarbonisation plan for the previous two years.At the same meeting at which the confusion was discovered, Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell and Conservative councillor Anne Jobson proposed a new risk register item to monitor the council’s ability to meet the 2030 decarbonisation target set for the city.While the meeting agreed the proposal, the council said it would not be able to deliver it until March this year.This is the proposal that led to the commitment to “assessing all our future policies against a carbon risk assessment” that appears in this year’s Exeter Labour election campaign leaflets.The party also claimed to have delivered “carbon savings of 550 tonnes” (presumably tCO2e) during the previous year, which Labour councillor David Harvey touted as evidence that the council had recognised the scale of the challenge in his belated climate emergency declaration motion.The council’s current annual corporate carbon footprint is 52,973 tCO2e, of which more than two-thirds is in scope 3. Of this total 550 tCO2e constitutes just 1%.Woman holding baby at Exeter youth climate strike in Bedford Street.

And despite its manifesto saying the project would be completed by now, it is not.When it is finished, the council’s 2.7MW solar arrays combined will produce around 2,500MWh of electricity each year (based on the output from the existing array).To put this into perspective, a 2017 report commissioned by Exeter City Futures found that Greater Exeter’s total annual energy consumption was 10TWh (terawatt hours) in 2014, and was set to increase to 11.3TWh by 2025.A terawatt is equal to one million megawatts, so the council’s arrays combined will produce energy equivalent to around 0.02% of Greater Exeter’s expected energy use three years from now.Iceland, which has a population similar to Greater Exeter while also being rich in renewable energy resources, has been generating 100% of its electricity (and 87% of its hot water and heating) from renewables for the past decade.Overflowing council rubbish bins in Exeter city centreExeter Labour’s confusion over the impact of the Marsh Barton waste incinerator is similar. In its 2020 manifesto (for the elections which were postponed because of the pandemic) it said the incinerator produced 23,000MW of what it called “low-carbon energy” in 2018 by burning 60,000 tonnes of waste.But the Devon County Council facility, which is expected to remain in use until 2050, is Exeter’s largest single source of carbon emissions: its waste incineration generated nearly 51,000 tCO2e in 2018, almost as much as the city council’s total corporate carbon footprint now.And just after last year’s local elections a council-financed scheme to connect the incinerator to a district heating network to supply the 2,500 new homes which are to be built as part of the South West Exeter extension had to be abandoned because most of the property developers involved were unwilling to accept modest additional up front costs.The council had said it was so confident about the scheme that an advance payment of £50,000 had been made for preliminary infrastructure works to take place.Exeter Labour summer 2019 campaign leafletExeter Labour also seems to be in disarray over the city’s recycling collection services. Exeter has among the lowest recycling rates in the country. It recycled just 27.59% of the 42,000 tonnes of waste it collected in 2020-21. Neighbouring East Devon District Council is in the top ten with a recycling rate of nearly 60% of 48,500 tonnes of waste.This poor performance is principally the result of the council’s failure to introduce kerbside food waste collections, despite promising to do so in its 2016 election manifesto and announcing its was about to do so in 2019.Labour councillor David Harvey said: “I am pleased to be able to announce these plans which are something we have been working towards for a long time now.” Council leader Phil Bialyk added: “This is another example of Labour delivering for Exeter”.In the 2020 manifesto, the claim that the council was on the verge of introducing the new scheme became “ambitious plans to introduce a kerbside collection in 2021, collecting paper, glass and food waste from the kerbside” which, it was hoped, would increase the city’s recycling rate to “well over 50%”.The party then claimed in March last year that the council was “preparing to deliver on its commitment to provide food waste and glass collection from every household in the city”.The council only managed to introduce a single food waste collection round in Alphington in November last year, eight months later, using a single second-hand truck which was all it had been able to buy because it had apparently not foreseen a demand for such vehicles.Front cover cutting from Autumn 2019 edition of Exeter CitizenIt recently laid out a litany of excuses for its failures around food waste and glass recycling, many of which were related to its decision to change its previous, long-considered, plan to introduce a kerbside sorting service like the one which enables East Devon to recycle such a high proportion of its household waste.The primary reason that was offered for this change of course was that the council hadn’t been sufficiently familiar with Exeter’s streets to realise that new vehicles might be too big for them.While Exeter Labour’s 2022 campaign leaflets claim it will extend the food waste collection service this year, and that it is still committed to introducing a kerbside glass collection service, they include no delivery timetable. The council admits it has no idea when either will happen.Nor does the party explain that glass collection will save the 1,200 tCO2e per annum it cites only when the whole city is covered.Its 2022 manifesto is more circumspect, only mentioning recycling once, in relation to a coffee machine pod collection service which is delivered in partnership with various corporate coffee machine brands.The 1,300 dwellings in Alphington that now receive a collection service constitute just over 2% of Exeter’s housing stock. Most Exeter food waste is still being burned in the Marsh Barton incinerator, and what is now being collected has to be driven eight miles east to Greendale Business Park then 50 miles the other way to a processing plant in Holsworthy.Overflowing council recycling bins at Magdalen Road car parkWaste collection and processing is just one among the many climate change mitigations that local councils must deliver: increasing the energy efficiency of housing is another.In part one of this series we assessed Exeter Labour’s 2022 manifesto pledge to build 500 council houses in the next five years against its existing delivery capacity — it has built 89 council homes since 2009 and is struggling to find subcontractors — and concluded there is little chance it will succeed.Those it does construct are built to high energy efficiency standards, although as the council has been building its housing to these standards, which were developed in the 1990s, for the past thirteen years we’re not sure how doing so sets “new standards for housing in Exeter” as the party’s manifesto claims.Meanwhile the council’s retrofitting project to improve the energy efficiency of its existing 4,800 council houses has been helped by a £1.6 million government grant. But there are discrepancies between the various claims that Exeter Labour has made about its progress.

In his 2022-23 budget speech council leader Phil Bialyk said: “370 properties will be completed by April 2022” with “another 250 properties targeted for completion during 2022-23”. Its election campaign leaflets say “over 400” have been completed with “400 more” due “by spring 2023”. And the party’s manifesto says it “will have completed 400” by “the end of 2022”.The party claims its retrofits deliver carbon emissions reductions of “over 3 tonnes per property” (presumably tCO2e) in its manifesto, which it says will have reduced Exeter’s carbon emissions by “around 12,000 tonnes” by the end of 2022. It is unclear how this figure is derived: 400 homes at 3 tonnes each equals 1,200 tonnes not 12,000.In his budget speech council leader Phil Bialyk said the retrofit programme would “upgrade council properties to achieve carbon neutrality”. However the programme does not deliver the same energy efficiency standard to which the council builds new homes, and the 22 new council houses it has constructed in the past three years all have ‘B’ grade energy performance ratings and gas boilers.Household carbon emissions are driven by much more than simply energy consumption, although it does play an important role. Witness the off-road car parking which the council has provided with all its new houses, none of which are fitted with electric vehicle charging points.Exeter City Council houses at Bovemoors LaneAt a rate of 250 dwellings per annum it will take around eighteen years to retrofit Exeter’s remaining council housing stock. The city’s other 52,000 dwellings present a much more significant challenge, not least because of an ongoing dispute about whether the council should have anything to do with retrofitting them at all.In June 2020 it allocated £300,000 to develop business cases for three new council-owned companies, one of which was to provide retrofit solutions for non-council housing.In November that year the council’s chief executive Karime Hassan said it would be “reasonable to assume that any mechanism put in place to support retrofit solutions will be a mixture of private and public sector funding”.In April last year he decided, in private, in his role as the council-owned companies shareholder representative, not to pursue the council retrofit company.Then in November last year, at the council executive meeting which discussed his move to become CEO of Exeter City Futures, he said retrofitting the non-council housing stock would be “exactly what Exeter City Futures will do”.At the same time Exeter Labour’s manifesto is silent on environmental standards for non-council development in the city despite the council being responsible for those standards as the local planning authority.The whole life carbon assessment approach advocated by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, which addresses the embodied and operational impacts of construction processes, including refurbishment, across the spectrum, is described as “the most comprehensive and consistent approach available to the industry” by the Royal Institute of British Architects.It also covers development which involves the demolition of existing buildings, which often entails a much higher carbon footprint than re-use no matter how energy efficient the resulting new structures are.The new London Plan, which was adopted by the Greater London Authority in March last year, includes a whole life carbon or greenhouse gas emission assessment policy. And the adoption of such policies is under way in other councils too.In June last year Labour councillor Emma Morse, who is the executive member with responsibility for city development, was asked to explain the extent to which embodied carbon emissions from new development, including emissions from development site demolition, are taken into account when the council determines planning applications.She said that it does not assess embodied carbon emissions in Exeter development.She was then asked whether the council recognised that the absence of such assessment will make it difficult to achieve its Net Zero Exeter 2030 target. She deferred her answer, then replied in writing, saying that the council “is leading by example in terms of promoting sustainable, high quality development”.Construction carbon lifecycle diagram. Image: University of Liverpool Zero Carbon Research Institute.As the council does not consider embodied carbon in new developments, however large, it is unable to assess their true environmental impact.Like HS2, large projects such as St Sidwell’s Point, which relies on extensive use of very high impact materials such as concrete and steel in its construction, could actually be net carbon emitters over their lifespan despite being ostensibly green.And the council does not even enforce the environmental standards for development set out in its own planning policies.A striking example of this is the approval it gave the university last year to demolish 30 buildings to construct ~50,000m2 of new student accommodation on a fifteen acre Streatham campus site. The development will entail the destruction of an established ecosystem and the demolition of buildings which are less than twenty years old.The council colluded with the university to allow both to lower their environmental standards: both are supposed to be committed to BREEAM Excellent or better for all new non-domestic development, which is still far short of the standards set by BREEAM Outstanding or whole life carbon assessment.University of Exeter Clydesdale Rise student accommodation buildings earmarked for demolitionThe council also circumnavigates high environmental standards in Exeter domestic development.It said it would prepare a Code for Sustainable Homes to improve these standards in December 2019, which it said it would adopt by January 2021.Then six months later it announced it would instead wait for the outcome of the government’s Future Homes Standard consultation on energy efficiency requirements for new buildings.The government consultation finished in February 2020 and the outcome was published in January 2021, but the council waited until June last year to say it had decided to postpone the introduction of new policy until the new Exeter Local Plan is adopted, which will not be until June 2024 at the earliest. It is unlikely the council will keep to its delivery schedule.Even though a new local plan had already been delayed by five years by the failed Greater Exeter Strategic Plan, with a replacement not due for at least another three years, the council said it would scrap the planned Code for Sustainable Homes.The Net Zero Exeter plan nevertheless says the city council should “refine local planning policy so that it requires the highest energy efficiency standards” by the end of 2022.Somerset West and Taunton Council, despite also having already begun development of a new local plan development process, introduced an interim “climate positive” planning policy in February last year which has had significant weight in its local planning decisions since."

"content" : "Long before the last ballot box from Exeter’s local elections has been counted next week, councillors old and new from all across the political spectrum will be speculating on who will serve on which of the council’s committees during the following year.Beyond the proportional allocation of committee seats to each party, the process by which members are allocated their responsibilities is shrouded in mystery. It is up to each party (or party leader) to decide who goes where, with appointments announced at the council’s annual meeting, to be held on 17 May this year.Some councillors end up with heavier workloads than others. Executive members have to attend not only a dozen executive meetings each year and eight or so full council meetings but also as many as eight scrutiny committees meetings, where the portfolio for which each is responsible is examined.Some Exeter City Council executive members also sit on the council’s planning committee, despite national guidance, which also meets regularly.Exeter Guildhall - centre of the city’s civic government for 600 yearsThe council’s committee meetings are the key means by which its business is conducted, in conjunction with meetings of the full council itself, although not all meet in public or report their proceedings, or even their decisions.Some councillors make significant contributions to bodies – such as the Planning Member Working Group and the Council Housing and Development Advisory Board – that are not open to public scrutiny.Casework on behalf of constituents is another important activity on which councillors may spend significant time.Nevertheless it is at public meetings that council decisions are taken, at least formally, so it is essential to the council’s democratic legitimacy that our elected representatives participate in them.Attendance at public council meetings is therefore an important measure of councillor commitment to their electors, alongside their less public activities.Exeter City Council in session at Exeter Guildhall. Photo: © Sandra Barrett, All Rights Reserved.Exeter City Council publishes retrospective meeting attendance records for those of its committees which do report their proceedings. These show how many meetings councillors were expected to attend and how many of those they did attend.As part of our 2022 Exeter local elections coverage we have examined the attendance figures for public council meetings held between 6 May 2021 and 21 April 2022.The results divided councillors into two groups. The first included councillors who intended to participate in seventeen or more meetings and attended 70% or more of them. These are the majority.This group included some less experienced councillors who were appointed to fewer committees and so had fewer opportunities to participate but who attended frequently.Some have 100% attendance records and are clearly making a significant contribution to the council’s public business.The second group included councillors who either only intended to participate in sixteen or fewer meetings (half as many as Keith Sparkes) or who attended less than 70% of those meetings.Among these, Jane Begley’s attendance fell sharply in the second half of her four year term. Although she is standing for re-election next week she has given up her relatively safe Pennsylvania ward seat, in which Labour increased its vote share by 13% in 2021, to contest the ballot in St Loye’s ward, a relatively safe Conservative seat.Labour’s Luke Sills stood down from his role as chair of the council’s strategic scrutiny committee in September last year to focus on his work commitments and his attendance rate fell sharply after that. He is not seeking re-election in St David’s ward next week.And both Conservative group leader Andrew Leadbetter and deputy leader Rob Newby are much less engaged than their party colleagues: the latter has the second lowest attendance rate of any councillor.Andrew Leadbetter’s low participation levels may at least be partly explained by his dual membership of both the city and county councils. And he is a member of the ruling cabinet at County Hall with responsibility for children’s services and schools.Dual membership does not, however, deter Labour’s Rob Hannaford from aiming at high attendance levels. And at County Hall he leads the Labour group.Hannah Packham has exceptionally only been expected to attend meetings of the full council: she missed two of those ten.Other than Trish Oliver, who as Lord Mayor does not sit on committees by convention, no other councillor has limited their participation in public meetings to such an extent.Unlike other Labour councillors with low attendance levels, Hannah Packham is not standing down and apparently intends to carry on for her full term ending in May 2023.She did not respond to the questions we asked about her remaining a councillor while attending no more than the minimum number of meetings. We note that she nevertheless finds time to act as chair of the Exeter constituency Labour party.Exeter Labour has form on the matter of low-participation councillors. Voters in the St David’s ward may remember the saga of Lewis Keen, who was elected for a three year term in 2016 when still a student at the University of Exeter.He moved to London to take up a job on completing his studies in 2018, returning only to attend just enough full council meetings to avoid disqualification.And Labour’s Robert Lamb, also representing St David’s ward, was absent without submitting apologies from thirteen of seventeen meetings at which he was expected in 2020-21 following an attendance record of 39% the previous year.He was disqualified from the city council just before last year’s local elections were held.

Ollie Pearson only attended three of the fourteen meetings in which he was expected to participate.We have also omitted the late Ian Quance (LAB), Deputy Lord Mayor, and father of Alys Martin.NOTES:  Attendance at meetings by councillors in a capacity other than as committee members has not been included when calculating attendance rates.  Absences due to ill-health or other personal or domestic circumstances have not been taken into account as they are not identified in the council’s attendance statistics.

"content" : "Last week we embarked on a 2022 local elections series aimed at providing a much-needed counterbalance to the mix of cheerleading and churnalism that is often delivered by Exeter’s media when it comes to local politics.We looked at previous and current election campaign claims made by Exeter Labour, which will have been in control of the city council for ten straight years by election day on 5 May.This will make it what the Electoral Reform Society calls a “one party council” with “weak electoral accountability” which greatly increases the likelihood of cronyism, corruption and spending decisions which offer poor value for public money.We focussed on the city’s housing crisis, debunking claims around housing delivery, publicly-funded developments on council land and the provision of affordable housing across the city, outlining the impact of university expansion on the city’s residential housing stock.  “In May 2021, the people of Exeter put their faith in Labour. We made promises to you and we are delivering on those promises.”  2022 Exeter Labour local elections campaign leafletOur scrutiny of the party in power continues with an examination of campaign claims about the city centre and Exeter’s wider economy, including its misrepresentation of content marketing materials as authoritative sources of information about the city.We asked Exeter Labour to respond to questions about these issues at the beginning of April, but it took more than a week to reply and still hasn’t provided any answers. We expected it to have the sources of its statements to hand, but it seems it does not.We haven’t scrutinised Exeter’s other parties in the same way because they haven’t been making the decisions for the past ten years and their policy proposals and attempts at intervention are routinely rejected or ignored. It’s the “Labour-led council” we seek to hold to account here, in the public interest and in the public sphere.We’ve included the party’s 2022-23 manifesto enable you to peruse its position in full as we cannot address all of the many claims it makes.As last year, we’ll also publish an insider’s guide to who’s standing where in the city and what we might expect the results to look like, then offer a rolling results service complete with graphical analysis of vote shares and swings as the winners and losers are announced.Subscribe to our free newsletter or follow us @exeterobserver to stay in the loop.Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 local elections manifesto includes no fewer than five photos of St Sidwell’s Point, the council’s recently-completed city centre leisure centre, and manages to mention it five times too.Statements include: “St Sidwell’s Point, built to Passivhaus standards, is one of the best facilities of its kind anywhere in Europe”, that it is “defining standards in the leisure and building industry” and that it “will play a vital role” in Exeter’s economy by “supporting the city centre and acting as a catalyst for the redevelopment of the wider area”.However there is no explanation of which standards the building is supposed to be defining nor any way to test the claim that it will play a vital role in Exeter’s economy in future.Both these claims are unverifiable: the normative fact-checking designation for subjective or speculative value judgements. See also the accompanying manifesto claim that the adjacent “new bus station has made a positive visual impact on the area attracting new business and visitors to the city”.Nevertheless, as there appear to be only two other Passivhaus pools in Europe, St Sidwell’s Point must surely be one of the best in a field of three, even if that isn’t saying much.And it does seem possible that the half a million annual city centre visits that its developer claims it will drive might be encouraged by the free car parking that is proposed for its users, but this claim cannot be assessed either as there is not yet any solid evidence to support it.St Sidwell’s Point under construction: 150 lorry loads of concrete were used in the first phase of building alone. The building’s lifetime carbon emissions have not been calculated.It is, however, possible to judge a 2022 party campaign leaflet claim made by Labour MP Ben Bradshaw in a section about St Sidwell’s Point and the refurbished Riverside leisure centre.He says: “Thanks to sound financial management and our council’s success in attracting investment to Exeter, while many parts of the country are losing leisure centres and other public assets, in Exeter they are expanding.”Neither the Riverside refurbishment nor the construction of St Sidwell’s Point (or the new bus station) are funded by inward investment: they are being paid for solely by the city council.The party’s campaign materials not only fail to mention that it has taken nearly ten years to build St Sidwell’s Point, or that it has cost £44 million to build — more than double its original £19.2 million budget — but also that the wider site redevelopment it was to catalyse (and was twice used to justify big budget increases) remains stalled.Both the £75 million Princesshay extension that was initially intended and the £300 million “CityPoint development concept” that the council came up with when the first set of plans failed remain on the drawing board.A key 2021 Exeter Labour local elections manifesto pledge for the coming year was to “transform Parliament Street into a tourist hotspot”.What Exeter Labour’s 2022 election campaign materials lack on the catalysing value of St Sidwell’s Point they seek to make up in claims about the rest of the city centre.While footfall has returned to pre-pandemic levels Exeter was not, as claimed, in the top ten for high street spending on the Centre for Cities tracker when it was last updated in March. At the same time city centre car parking ticket sales remained 16% lower than pre-pandemic levels.High street vacancy rates are relatively low at 13%, but these levels are replicated in major cities like London, which is in the bottom ten on the tracker for footfall and spending recovery.This does not, of course, mean that the capital’s economy is fundamentally weak while Exeter’s is fundamentally strong. Centre for Cities agrees, judging Exeter’s city centre economy to be no more than “moderately strong” as its post-pandemic recovery is outstripped by places including Plymouth on every metric.Independent local businesses on Paris StreetCity centre economic health can be assessed in many ways, some of which are instructive despite being too granular to include in comparative national analysis.Independent local businesses and cultural initiatives are thriving on Paris Street and Sidwell Street, despite the council’s attempts to redevelop the “CityPoint” site and not because of them.At the same time the much-touted introduction of Eastgate Market, identified as a key achievement in Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 manifesto, has already been “paused” because of low footfall levels.But what about the rest of Exeter’s major employment sites, including Matford, Marsh Barton, Sowton, Pynes Hill and Exeter Business Park, none of which are mentioned in the party’s manifesto yet which together provide most of the city’s jobs?Exeter Labour’s 2022 campaign leaflets suggest it sees returning city centre footfall as evidence of wider economic recovery when it is not. Most of the claims it makes about more orthodox city-wide economic indicators require closer scrutiny too.  “Exeter has seen a strong economic recovery, with footfall in the city centre returning to pre-pandemic levels, supporting our high street.”  2022 Exeter Labour local elections campaign leafletOne such indicator is wages. In his 2022-23 budget speech council leader Phil Bialyk said: “In the last twelve months average salaries for Exeter residents increased by 6.4% to £30,825. The average workplace salary increased by 6.6% to £31,033 — well above the south west average.”These averages are medians which, while preferable to arithmetic means when quoting wages because they are not skewed by outlying values, nevertheless convey no information about the range of values or the distribution of values across that range.Such distributions are important when considering wages, especially in Exeter, the seventh most unaffordable city in the country. This is because housing is considered to be “affordable” when it costs 80% of local market prices, without taking wages into account, so the more unaffordable a place becomes the more the gap between earnings and living costs widens in real terms.As median wage figures do not convey what proportion of a population can afford housing costs they are, at best, unhelpful when considering earnings in an economic context dominated by housing affordability.However there are more serious issues with the use of these figures to represent Exeter earnings.The council leader failed to mention that they include full-time workers only, excluding the quarter of the workforce who work part-time, many of whom are women who also typically receive lower wages than men however many hours they work.(In Exeter the median gender wage gap means full-time male workers currently earn 17.6% more than their female counterparts.)Nor did he mention that the figures he presented as annual salaries were derived by multiplying weekly wage figures by 52, not sourced direct from the annual salary information which is also supplied by the HMRC Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, the source of all these figures.Weekly wage data are not interchangeable with annual salary data because of the different basis on which people are employed in each case. And they don’t include the self-employed either.Nor did he make clear that more than a third of the jobs located in Exeter are performed by people who don’t live here, making the use of Exeter workplace earnings unrepresentative for Exeter electors.The picture is very different if we instead look at earnings for all employees who do live in Exeter. Instead of a 6.4% increase to a median annual salary of £30,825, as claimed, median Exeter salaries increased by just £5 per annum between 2019 and 2021 — to £23,404.This means that Exeter median earnings have actually fallen in real terms over the past two years because of inflation. In addition they are lower than the median annual salary for all south west employees, which was £24,157 in 2021, as well as lower than the median annual salary of £26,192 across the whole country.In fact-checking parlance the council leader’s claims are therefore mostly false: they may contain a kernel of truth but leave out facts which would produce a different conclusion.Perhaps this is why, despite being repeated in an unpublished council economy briefing note in March, they do not appear in Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 manifesto, which does not mention earnings at all.Exeter Princesshay Debenhams closing down saleAnother more orthodox city-wide economic indicator is the number of businesses registered for VAT and/or PAYE. Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 manifesto echoes the council leader’s budget speech word for word: “Between 2019 and 2021, despite all the problems caused by the pandemic, the number of businesses in Exeter increased by more than 4%”.This statement disguises an important underlying trend: the growth takes the form of micro-enterprises which employ fewer than five people.The number of small businesses employing 10-49 people actually fell, the number of medium-sized businesses employing 50-249 remained static and Exeter lost five of its 35 large businesses, which employ more than 250 people, between 2019 and 2021.This is acknowledged in the council’s unpublished economy briefing note, which recognises the loss of “predominantly national chains which no longer consider a high street presence as viable” in the context of a Centre for Cities report which found that Exeter had among the highest reductions in bricks and mortar fashion retail sales in the country: a fall of 17%.The briefing note also identifies another important underlying trend as an “area of concern” which was neither mentioned in the council leader’s budget speech nor Exeter Labour’s manifesto.This is that while the city’s working age population has remained steady, the number of economically active people has shrunk, falling by 7,000 — just over 10% — in the twelve months to January 2021. This includes the loss of 20% of the city’s self-employed workers, and is reflected in there now being more job vacancies in Exeter than there are universal credit claimants.Instead of identifying a shortage of economically active people as a cause of “all sectors” in Exeter experiencing “difficulties in recruiting”, or an overheated housing market leading to people “declining job offers as they are unable to find rental properties within or near the city”, the note infers “confidence amongst our business community” from an increase in unfilled vacancies.Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 manifesto echoes this sentiment with: “Businesses in the city are expressing high levels of confidence in the future”, to which the council leader added, in his budget speech: “And for good reason. The economy in Exeter has bounced back strongly.”The unpublished briefing note is more pragmatic: “Since businesses have re-opened they are seeing rising base costs including energy, taxes, raw materials, fuel, wage inflation, interest rate rises, COVID loan repayments due March/April, VAT deferrals and salary increases.“Some businesses are seeing a seven-fold increase for some business costs. Some of these business cost rises have been as a result of the pandemic, but can also be attributed to Brexit. When speaking with businesses across the city, growth ambitions still remain if they can weather the current storm.”Shops to let on Exeter High StreetExeter Labour’s economic spin is not limited to selective representation of orthodox information sources: the party has a penchant for repeating claims derived from content marketing materials too.These are materials which are designed to be of perceived value in their target markets, produced and distributed by businesses seeking to avoid the weaknesses of traditional direct marketing by instead indirectly marketing themselves as their authors.Their widespread reproduction has directly contributed to the confusion of relatively independent and authoritative sources of information with those which are essentially commercial in nature or intent, corrupting the public sphere.Such materials are the origin of the claim, prominently presented in Exeter Labour’s 2022 election campaign leaflets, that “Exeter will move into the top ten cities in 2022, for economic growth including increased employment”.Council leader Phil Bialyk, Labour councillor Rachel Sutton and the council press office all repeated this claim in official council communications in December last year, and it appeared in Exeter Science Park PR and other local media too.Its source is a “UK Powerhouse” report published by law firm Irwin Mitchell, which regularly commissions another private firm called the Centre for Economics and Business Research to produce similar content marketing materials.Apart from the fact that no evidence is available to assess future forecasts, the report’s authors employ their own, unpublished, methodology in preference to relying on official economic data sources.They do, however, also present retrospective GVA and employment figures in tabular rankings in their reports, allowing comparison between them.We examined Exeter’s rankings in a total of eleven Irwin Mitchell reports covering a period of four years to the end of 2021. We found numerous discrepancies.These include the presentation of both Exeter GVA and employment level reductions, as well as unchanged levels, as increases, and percentage changes that do not relate to the GVA or employment figures they accompany. This applies to both retrospective and forecast figures.The reports rank Exeter in the top ten for GVA and/or employment growth no fewer than 26 times. One report forecast year on year employment growth of 6.5% to 114,800 jobs in 2021 Q2 and also forecast employment growth of 9.9% to 112,300 jobs in 2021 Q4, six months later, despite the later figure being 2,500 lower than the earlier figure.Most remarkably, the reports claim that Exeter’s GVA grew nearly 30% in the two years to autumn 2019, but that it shed nearly 27,000 jobs at the same time, a workforce reduction of more than 20%.Apart from their mutual incompatibility, these claims differ radically from the figures derived by the Office for National Statistics, which publishes both its methodologies and regular methodology reviews.The ONS says Exeter’s GVA grew by about 6% over the same two year period, during which time it added around 2,600 jobs — a workforce increase of just under 3% — while the population grew by around 2%.So while we should be extremely sceptical of Irwin Mitchell report claims about an Exeter economic miracle, the firm is no doubt delighted that Exeter Labour has taken them up so enthusiastically that it has spent public money marketing the firm’s brand in official council communications and has even highlighted it in its 2022 election campaign leaflets.Overflowing rubbish bins in Exeter city centreUnfortunately, Exeter Labour’s susceptibility isn’t limited to Irwin Mitchell’s relatively sophisticated content marketing “campaign”, as the firm blithely describes it.Its 2022 elections manifesto says one of its key achievements last year was Exeter being “announced as the second cleanest city in the country in a national survey”. Party campaign leaflets present this as Exeter being “recognised as one of the proudest, cleanest and greenest cities in the UK” in what they describe as a “national study”.Council leader Phil Bialyk enthusiastically endorsed this claim in an official council communication, saying that “it was fantastic for Exeter to be recognised in a national survey as being the second cleanest city in the country, and the second highest ranked location for having pride in its neighbourhoods”.The council press office also promoted the claim despite its source being a piece of content marketing for a builder’s merchant in Leicester.The builder’s merchant didn’t present its findings as serious research with a robust methodology to match. Instead it “looked at a number of factors” to assign scores for several cities including a user-generated content website which says that it needs more contributors for Exeter to increase its data quality and an advertising keyword tool which was used to find the number of searches for the phrase “recycling near me” in each city.Ranking factors also included the number of local gardening groups and levels of council expenditure on environmental and regulatory services.

Subscribe freeThe builder’s merchant didn’t consider whether high levels of such spending might equate to effective service delivery or simply poor value for taxpayers’ money. But widespread disbelief expressed by Exeter city centre traders when the rankings were announced, posted alongside photos of uncollected bins on social media to evidence their experience of council refuse collection, suggests it probably should have done so.It did manage to talk up ten cities, one way or another, and succeeded in getting plenty of coverage around the country from local media channels that rely on such material. But it looks like Exeter was the only local authority to fall for its marketing scheme.Relying on content marketing materials rather than authoritative sources of information doesn’t just make the “Labour-led council” look gullible, damaging its credibility, or waste public money providing free publicity to private firms.It emboldens those who wish to mislead it by taking advantage of a dangerous disposition to dispense with critical scrutiny in favour of exceptionalist fantasies instead of confronting the challenges Exeter must face with candour and humility."

"content" : "By the time electors go to the polls on 5 May in this year’s local elections, Exeter City Council will have become what the Electoral Reform Society calls a “one party council” because Labour will have been in control for ten straight years.Academic research has shown that this “weak electoral accountability” greatly increases the likelihood of cronyism, corruption and spending decisions which offer poor value for public money.In recent stories we have examined decisions to send the council’s chief executive and another senior director to work for Exeter City Futures, which may have been unlawful, to purchase and redevelop the Guildhall shopping centre for £55 million despite significant commercial investment risks, and a sequence of secretive property development decisions involving public land and money which may also be putting the council at risk.As Exeter Labour’s comms machine grinds into action once more, filling your inboxes, letter boxes and social media feeds with election campaign materials, we embark on a series of stories aimed at providing a much-needed counterbalance to the mix of cheerleading and churnalism often delivered by the city’s media channels when it comes to local politics.Between now and election day we will look at pledges the party has made during previous election campaigns, examine some of the claims it is making this year and provide an insider’s guide to who’s standing where in the city and what we might expect the results to look like.As last year we’ll then offer a rolling results service complete with graphical analysis of vote shares and swings as the winners and losers are announced. Follow us @exeterobserver to stay in the loop.  “In May 2021, the people of Exeter put their faith in Labour. We made promises to you and we are delivering on those promises.”  2022 Exeter Labour local elections campaign leafletA party that has been in power as long as Labour has in Exeter should not only expect to be the subject of enhanced scrutiny, it should be sufficiently resilient to welcome criticism and prepared to make its case in turn.When we asked it to respond to a series of questions about its campaign materials, however, it took more than a week to reply, and still didn’t provide any answers. We expected the party to have the sources on which its claims are based to hand, but it seems it does not.As we cannot address all of Labour’s many statements we’ve included its 2022-23 manifesto in full to enable you to assess its position in detail. We’ve refrained from looking at campaign materials from before 2016, by when it had already been the largest party on the council for five years.We also haven’t scrutinised Exeter’s other political parties in the same way. Not only have they not been making the decisions for the past ten years, their policy proposals and attempts at intervention are routinely rejected or ignored. It’s the “Labour-led council” we seek to hold to account here, in the public interest and in the public sphere.Among the most striking claims in the 2022-23 Exeter Labour election manifesto is that “Exeter is the No.1 city in the UK for increase in housing stock”, which it lists among its key achievements during 2021-22. Council leader Phil Bialyk also made this claim during his 2022-23 budget speech, when he said it had been derived from the Centre for Cities.Centre for Cities housing stock data is out of date: the most recent year it covers is 2019-20. During that year it shows Exeter in 28th place for actual housing stock increase. It is only when this change is viewed as a percentage increase per head of population that Exeter comes out on top, but this is partly a function of the city being amongst the smallest places included in the 63 cities and towns that the Centre for Cities covers.In fact Exeter only just squeaks over the Centre for Cities’ minimum population threshold of 135,000 on the basis of its large daytime commuter influx. Exeter’s residential population remains below this level.Exeter estimated population 2020. Source: Centre for Cities.Both Exeter Labour and the council have a habit of selectively quoting Centre for Cities statistics without considering methodological issues relating to Exeter’s exceptionally large travel to work area which distorts them — issues which Centre for Cities itself recognises.Exeter was only included in Centre for Cities reporting when its methodology was changed to reduce its previous emphasis on travel to work areas.However there is a much more significant issue with these figures, which the Centre for Cities does not factor in: summary housing stock completion data includes Purpose Built Student Accommodation.Of the 1,137 housing units completed in Exeter in 2019-20, the year to which Labour’s claim refers, more than half were student accommodation bedspaces according to the council’s own monitoring report. In 2020-21 non-student housing completions fell to just 348, over 200 fewer than in 2019-20.In normative fact-checking terminology this manifesto claim is therefore mostly false: it may contain a kernel of truth but leaves out facts which would produce a different conclusion.Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 election manifesto goes on to say that this housing stock claim is “reflected in the council exceeding the housing delivery test with a score of 155%”, which it also lists among its key achievements and which council leader Phil Bialyk also included in his 2022-23 budget speech.However this figure again depends on the inclusion of Purpose Built Student Accommodation in Exeter’s housing delivery totals, despite a 2015 High Court judgement which ruled that Purpose Built Student Accommodation could only be included in local authority five year land supplies if there was evidence that its construction resulted in the release of existing residential housing stock from student occupation.The council claimed in its September 2021 five year housing land supply statement that Exeter could include student accommodation in its delivery totals as the government had introduced a new housing delivery test methodology in 2018 and new guidance in 2019.The guidance said that Purpose Built Student Accommodation could be counted as part of the housing supply to the extent it released existing residential housing stock from student occupation, or allowed such stock to remain in general use.But there is no evidence that residential housing stock is either being retained for or returned to general use in Exeter, as the university’s inexorable expansion continues to outpace the construction of new student accommodation blocks.Without including Purpose Built Student Accommodation Exeter’s housing delivery test score for 2020-21 would be 93%, making this manifesto claim also mostly false.This was reflected in a test of the council’s five year housing land supply statement as part of a January planning appeal. In her decision the planning inspector found that the council had overstated its delivery claims.The supply of Purpose Built Student Accommodation has not kept pace with demand: there are now just under 16,000 university students living in Exeter’s residential housing stock in around 4,500 HMOs which could otherwise be used for residential housing by local people.This is because Exeter university student numbers have increased dramatically in the past ten years, requiring an additional 12,500 term-time accommodation bedspaces.The university’s Exeter student roll increased by just under 2,700 in 2020-21. If it has another year of growth like this one another 500 dwellings will be lost from Exeter’s residential housing stock and the number of student HMOs will overtake the number of council houses in the city.This means that university expansion alone is enough to offset most, if not all, of the housing stock increases resulting from new development. The council’s relentless promotion of the city to incomers and visitors via its parody-proof “Liveable Exeter” and “Exeter Live Better” marketing brands is an additional demand driver.Liveable Exeter promotional map. Does anyone who lives here already not know where they are? Source: Exeter City Council.Neither Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 election manifesto nor its 2022 campaign leaflets have anything to say about these student accommodation issues, which are the result of many years of flawed council student accommodation policy-making.It hasn’t always been so reticent: in its 2018 manifesto it made commitments to “prevent student development on council-owned land and review the student accommodation planning policy”. It repeated the same pledges during its 2019 campaign in leaflets and its manifesto.Its 2020 manifesto (for elections which were postponed because of the pandemic) repeated the council land policy promise, and the party subsequently confirmed that it had introduced this policy, but Labour councillors nevertheless approved the redevelopment of Harlequins shopping centre for “co-living”, described as student accommodation “in all but name”, in December. Harlequins is on council-owned land.Harlequins revised redevelopment scheme - block two model view of Paul Street elevation. Image: Corsorphine &amp;amp; WrightThe party’s 2020 manifesto also made a housing policy commitment, but it had morphed into “a new shared housing planning policy recognising the needs of all people requiring homes”.Under the heading “Build to Rent” it said: “This accommodation, which is also known as co-living, has the potential to help meet the growing demand for private rented housing” and went on: “The development of purpose built shared housing will be supported, provided that occupation is restricted to students by means of either (a) Section 106 Agreement and 35% of bedspaces are provided (and maintained in perpetuity) as affordable student bedspaces, or (b) the developer pays a financial contribution towards the provision of affordable housing off site.”A decision notice followed in August which said the council would define its policy position on student accommodation and co-living in October 2020, but it subsequently scrapped the plan. It said it would instead develop the policy as part of the new local plan which will not come into force until June 2024 at the earliest.In November last year, after failing to mention students altogether in the party’s May elections manifesto, Labour councillors voted to scrap the hotel planned as part of the Harlequins development and double the number of co-living/student blocks.This year’s Exeter Labour manifesto also includes several mostly false claims about the delivery of specific housing developments. It says “commencement of delivery at Clifton Hill and Vaughan Road” were key achievements from last year.The Clifton Hill sports centre site has still not been sold and redevelopment work is not expected to begin for several more months, while the Vaughan Road site development contractor has pulled out because of “current market conditions” and delivery “has yet to be finalised”.This year’s manifesto also cites the construction of twenty council houses at Bovemoors Lane and Thornpark Rise as key achievements from 2021-22. Ten houses have been built at Bovemoors Lane and nine at Thornpark Rise, but all were completed by January 2021.In his 2022-23 budget speech, council leader Phil Bialyk said: “Work has commenced on 21 new Passivhaus flats at Hamlin Gardens” but the site remains in use as a car park.Hamlin Gardens development site: the council approved a budget of £4 million for a four storey block of 21 flats here in October 2019, with Exeter City Living as its development agent, but had to increase the budget by £1.3 million last month in response to rising costs. Work has yet to begin.Exeter City Living, the council’s wholly-owned development company, is responsible for all these projects.The council has so far allocated nearly £1 million to the company for start up and planning costs, loaned it nearly £25 million for development delivery, gifted it more than £2 million in land purchase discounts and commissioned or purchased just over £20 million of housing.The company has also been granted more than £7 million of central government financial support, yet it has so far completed a total of just 22 units, all of which are council houses, and it has taken five years for the council to get this far.Exeter Labour’s 2022 election campaign leaflets say it has “continued its commitment to deliver over 500 council homes in the next five years”. Yet its current delivery rates mean it is losing council housing (via right to buy sales and other routes) faster than it is building replacements. There appears to be little chance it can fulfil this pledge.Edwards Court care housing scheme: the council spent £6 million on this development, which Labour lists as a key achievement in its 2022-23 manifesto. However it was compelled to take responsibility for facilities management when its plan to commission a care provider fell through because of “market changes” and the building is still empty six months after completion.Despite the net loss of council housing Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 manifesto says it is “proud of being a council which has maintained and developed our number of social housing homes”. It also says it “insists on affordable housing as part of any new commercial housing developments”.When Exeter City Living was created in July 2018 the late Pete Edwards, then council leader, was adamant that it would always satisfy the council’s policy that 35% of all developments over ten houses would be affordable.This did not prevent the council scrapping the planning agreement that bound the company to include eleven affordable flats in the Clifton Hill sports centre redevelopment, which would only have been 26% of its 42 homes in any case. Some of these houses are expected to go on sale for more than £800,000 when they are finally completed.Clifton Hill sport centre development site: Exeter City Living intends to construct 42 housing units here, some for sale for more than £800,000, but the centre closed four years ago and redevelopment work is still not expected to begin for several more months.Even the party’s own campaign materials confirm that it has not delivered its own affordable housing policy. Its 2019 manifesto said that 19.5% of the homes completed in Exeter since 2013 were affordable, then its 2020 manifesto said this figure had risen to 20.9%.However these claims are false. Even if we allow the council’s argument that Purpose Built Student Accommodation should be included in Exeter’s housing delivery totals, only 11% of the units completed between 2013 and 2019 were affordable (including council housing). The true figure for 2013 to 2020 was 10.1%.And when Purpose Built Student Accommodation is excluded from the figures, which would help Exeter Labour’s case, the proportion of affordable housing delivered in Exeter between 2013 and 2021 was just 15.7%. Over the past three years this has fallen to 12.6%.Labour didn’t make any claims about its affordable housing delivery rates in last year’s manifesto, and it hasn’t in this year’s either.These low affordable delivery rates have been compounded by the developing disconnect between the local economy, dominated by large public sector and poorly-paid tertiary service workers, and the spending power of those driving Exeter housing demand: university students (or their parents) and incomers from other parts of the country.Both renting and purchasing have become extremely unaffordable for Exeter residents: the council admitted as much last month when it acknowledged that “house prices have risen by 18% since December 2016”.It also acknowledged the impact this was having on the local economy in turn: “People are declining job offers as they are unable to find rental properties within or near the city”.As housing is considered to be “affordable” when it costs 80% of local market prices, without considering local wages, the more unaffordable a place becomes the more the gap between earnings and costs widens in real terms.Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that Exeter Labour demurs from quoting the Centre for Cities on this issue: it says Exeter is now the seventh most unaffordable city in the country.

Subscribe freeThere are other major housing-related issues Exeter Labour’s election manifesto should address because of their importance for the city, particularly as it has been in power for so long, but about which it has nothing to say.One is the decision to increase council housing rents by the maximum 4.1% allowed at the time as a cost of living crisis sweeps through the country, with the prospect of inflation peaking at over 10% for poorer households by the end of the year.Another is the role played by the unelected Liveable Exeter Place Board, which meets in private and does not publish its discussions or decisions. The council’s chief executive said its aim is “to enable collective decision-making” around “issues relating to housing delivery, place shaping, economic development, clean growth and carbon neutral development”.However perhaps the most significant of all is the size of the debt Exeter’s council tax-payers are expected to shoulder to finance the “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme if the council doesn’t change course. Its capital borrowing is expected to reach £300 million this year after nearly doubling since 2020-21."

"content" : "The county council has derived more surprising new insights from the second phase of a consultation on the impact of traffic in Heavitree and Whipton.Cabinet member Stuart Hughes, who is responsible for highway management, said it had shown “that people feel that traffic does impact on their local neighbourhood.”A council press release summarised the consultation’s findings as “traffic has a negative effect on the attractiveness of the area, walking and cycling is not given priority over cars and other traffic [and] parking significantly contributes to pollution.”It’s only eighteen months since the first phase of the consultation began. The county council’s next steps? Convene another meeting of Exeter HaTOC to talk about the results."

"content" : "Exeter City Council has excluded scope 3 carbon emissions from a baseline greenhouse gas emissions inventory it commissioned to plan Exeter decarbonisation, effectively ensuring that the city will not meet its “Net Zero Exeter 2030” goal.Scope 3 includes indirect carbon emissions which are imported through the consumption of goods and services from elsewhere, largely including transport, shipping and aviation, procurement and supply chains, waste management and commercial activity.The most widely-used international emissions accounting tool, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol is a corporate reporting approach which includes fifteen scope 3 emissions categories. A Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities builds on this tool to provide a basis for community-scale carbon emission measurement.98% of Apple’s corporate carbon footprint falls under scope 3. As accountancy firm Deloitte says: “Scope 3 is nearly always the big one”.In 2016 the ONS estimated that 40% of the UK’s carbon footprint related to imported emissions while DEFRA found the proportion had risen to 43% two years later. Both used a consumption-based approach to analyse the country’s carbon footprint that complements, but does not map directly on to, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities approach.Wealthy cities typically import a high proportion of their emissions. Those with low levels of carbon-intensive industrial activity, such as Exeter, tend to be at the upper end of this group. So the share of scope 3 imported emissions in Exeter may be as much as 50% or more of the city’s carbon footprint.Production vs consumption based emissions by category from The Future Of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World, University of Leeds, ARUP &amp;amp; C40 CitiesThe council has not announced its decision to exclude these emissions from Exeter’s carbon plans. It was instead buried in the minutes of an audit and governance committee which have only just been published, nearly a month after the meeting took place, in the same week that the IPCC delivered its latest comprehensive review of climate science.The IPCC report is a final warning for policy-makers. It says greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 to give the world a chance of meeting the all-scopes Paris Agreement targets.Professor Jim Skea of Imperial College, who is a member of the UK Climate Change Committee and co-chair of the IPCC Working Group which authored the report said: “It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”UN secretary general António Guterres added: “Some government and business leaders are saying one thing — but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic.”UN secretary general António Guterres on the latest IPCC reportWe asked the council when and on what basis the decision was taken to exclude scope three emissions from the Exeter greenhouse gas emissions baseline inventory it commissioned, as well as who took the decision.It said: “The work was commissioned following the decision of council to establish a carbon budget for the city of Exeter to show the baseline position for the city, the various city sectors that contribute to carbon emissions, and the targets to achieve Net Zero 2030. There was no intention to include scope 3 emissions in this particular commission.”However neither of the decisions taken by councillors to commission a carbon budget mentions any such exclusion.In July 2019 they resolved to “conduct a full audit of the city to highlight gaps between current plans and what is required to achieve carbon neutral” and to “define a clear city plan showing outcomes that will need to be met to deliver carbon neutral”.Exeter City Futures was initially tasked with delivery. The company said it would assemble an academic team with the requisite specialist expertise to establish a “robust definition of what is included in the measurement of Exeter’s carbon emissions” as well as a measurement framework to make sense of all the data.However it later admitted that it did not have the “resource capacity” to deliver the promised audit. Nor did it assemble an expert academic team to define the city’s carbon footprint or produce the framework.The “Net Zero Exeter” plan that Exeter City Futures subsequently produced, and which the council adopted in July 2020, failed to account for around a million tonnes of annual Exeter greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the emissions it ignored are in scope 3.Source: ONS.The council did nothing about this until a second decision, taken in December last year, to “establish a carbon budget for the city of Exeter to show the baseline position for the city, the various city sectors who contribute to carbon emissions [and] the targets to achieve net zero”.This decision was taken in response to calls from Green Party councillors for an Exeter carbon budget based on properly calculated baseline emissions which specifies the annual reductions required to meet the city’s decarbonisation goals, and an annual report which demonstrates progress towards these goals.The council’s chief executive had already said there was a high risk that the council would be unable to “deliver carbon neutral aspirations for Exeter by 2030”.So when Green Party councillor Diana Moore followed up with a formal question about the study at last month’s audit and governance committee meeting it should perhaps not have come as a surprise that the council had quietly decided not to include scope 3 emissions in its plans “at this stage given the limited ability to be able to take direct action”.In response to our questions the council said it had restricted the study to territorial emissions on the basis such emissions are “more in the control of people living, working and visiting the city”. The council nevertheless includes scope 3 emissions arising from its purchasing decisions in its own corporate carbon budget.The council offered no explanation for its contradictions over imported consumption emissions, and it won’t tell us who decided to implement the July 2019 decision to commission a city carbon budget this way.Exeter can nevertheless anticipate a “clear position statement” in “early summer” from Exeter City Futures, which the council says has a “key lobbying and influencing role” in regional and national policy-making “in relation to scope 3 emissions”.  What would a proper Exeter carbon plan include?  As the University of Exeter’s organisational carbon plan illustrates, a proper decarbonisation framework would:      capture a comprehensive baseline of the city’s emissions across all sectors and all emissions scopes    define annual reduction targets for each of these sectors and scopes, including interim targets which minimally match government goals against specific dates    determine annual monitoring mechanisms which report performance against those targets to enable intervention and policy refinement.    It would also include a separate account of the city’s annual offsetting capacity so there is no confusion about offsetting’s limited potential to address our residual emissions.The city council’s decision to exclude imported emissions from Exeter’s decarbonisation plan makes a nonsense of its commitment to Exeter being “recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”.The council and its partners also repeatedly claim, in press releases and policy documents, that the Net Zero Exeter plan provides “a clear roadmap to carbon neutrality”.At the same time Devon County Council’s Devon Climate Emergency Response Group also largely excludes scope 3 emissions from its carbon footprint calculations.It omits aviation and shipping altogether (despite estimating that flights from Exeter airport alone were responsible for 173,000tCO2e in 2019) and only includes scope 3 emissions associated with the transmissions and distribution of electricity in its figures, which are supplied by the same University of Exeter team commissioned by the city council.

Subscribe freeIn September 2020 the city council said it had put fighting climate change “at the top of its agenda”, quoting a pledge by council leader Phil Bialyk that the “ambition of creating a net zero carbon city by 2030 will be at the heart of everything the council does going forward”.The following month Labour councillor Rachel Sutton, who is Executive Portfolio Holder for Net Zero Exeter 2030, said that Exeter was “in the vanguard of this nationwide challenge” and was “one of the few councils in the country to have set out a road map that was both deliverable and practical”.Since then the city’s decarbonisation plans have been found wanting in a nationwide council climate action plan study which ranked Somerset West and Taunton as the highest scoring local authority area in the country. Its Carbon Neutrality and Climate Resilience Action Plan (published in September 2020) addresses all three emissions scopes.Last year’s Exeter local elections campaign was dominated by Labour claims about the council’s environmental credentials, and the party’s efforts this year look similarly focussed. Its campaign leaflets say Exeter is “an exemplar city in the UK for carbon reduction” which is “leading the way on climate change and the green agenda”.Perhaps the council leader’s use of the word “ambition” reveals what’s really going on? Its Latin root means “to go around canvassing for votes”.FOOTNOTESeveral carbon emissions accounting approaches have been developed during the thirty years since the Rio Summit, and efforts to refine these approaches continue.A comprehensive (and globally just) approach to calculating the carbon emissions of a given population or geography requires the use of a methodology which accounts not only for emissions produced (and consumed) with that territory, but also emissions that are imported (and exported).Such an approach accounts for emissions in the places where goods and services are consumed, rather than the (usually many) places that respond to that demand by supplying the goods or services in which emissions are embedded. It produces what is often referred to as a carbon footprint for that population or geography.In the UK there are teams at several universities working on carbon emissions accounting methodologies, each of which have produced slightly different accounts of the situation for various reasons, as we outlined in a previous story which attempted to estimate the true size of Exeter’s carbon footprint.The University of Exeter Centre for Energy and the Environment team commissioned by the city council to produce Exeter’s baseline carbon budget follows, but does not fully adhere to, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Cities approach to calculate carbon emissions for places.The Devon Carbon Plan also relies on this team for its county-wide figures, which are broken down into districts on the Devon Climate Emergency website.However both the county, and now the city, have omitted scope 3 emissions from their carbon budgets, ignoring even the aviation and shipping emissions which the government decided to include in the UK’s sixth carbon budget twelve months ago.Sweden has since become the world’s first country to decide to include comprehensive consumption-based emissions in its national climate targets (which are to reach net zero by 2045, five years earlier than the UK).The restricted territorial approach to emissions measurement chosen by unnamed local council officers in Exeter has the effect of ignoring around half, perhaps more, of the greenhouse gases that are generated by the actions of people who live and work here.It is undoubtedly very difficult to truly reduce our carbon emissions to levels compatible with limiting global heating to 1.5°C. Radical changes far beyond current local discourse would be required.However simply excluding hundreds of thousands of tonnes of annual carbon emissions from city and county decarbonisation plans not only misrepresents the situation, misguiding individual and organisational decision-making and action, it denies the options we do have to reduce imported consumption emissions altogether."

No worries, in that case.NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT?Any Exeter-based readers who fancy £144,000 a year to help the government deliver its “Levelling Up” agenda (still only a white paper) in the South West need look no further. DLUHC is advertising “an opportunity for exceptional leaders to work collaboratively with local areas and all of us across central government to drive new and innovative local policy proposals based on a real understanding of local issues and opportunities.”You’d be expected to “drive delivery of levelling up missions through a new, closer partnership between local and central government” and would draw on existing local networks to “live, breathe and champion the places you represent while working closely with local partners, senior officials and ministers to help develop and deliver new approaches to tackling systemic, place-based challenges.”You’ve got until close on 18 April to get your application in. But you might like to take a look at the Institute for Government’s take on the twelve “missions” you’d be pursuing first.It says five are not ambitious enough, three are too ambitious to be realistic, four don’t define what success looks like, two have too narrow a focus and one (re. R&amp;amp;D spending) has little to do with the aim of levelling up. Its verdict is that the government’s agenda won’t reduce regional inequality or “deliver change on the scale that is needed”. Oh, and there is little or no new money for delivery in any case.IT’S SCRUTINY, JIM, BUT NOT AS IT SHOULD BEThe city council kicked off a quartet of scrutiny meetings intended to pave the way for councillors to give Exeter Development Fund a green light with a session on Wednesday that resembled a sales pitch.Instead of first focussing on substantive detail, then considering risk, before assessing possible benefits and the merits of any rationale, the council has arranged the sequence of meetings the other way around.Karime Hassan was present to make the case for the project, but the only clue as to whether he was there to represent Exeter City Futures, where he now works two days a week, or the city council, where he remains chief executive for the other three, was his reluctance to answer questions.Not content with controlling the agenda, the council sought to determine the meeting’s outcomes in advance and even went as far as suggesting questions that councillors might like to ask.When committee members such as Amy Sparling had the temerity to head off-piste, by asking to what extent Net Zero Exeter plan delivery will rely on the development fund, the meeting’s chair stepped in. But not before Roli Martin, also pitching for Exeter City Futures, said he had no idea.

ON THE AGENDANOT WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TINDevon County Council’s approach to keeping the public in the dark about Devon Carbon Plan production continues with its invitation to the public to “have a say on the Devon Carbon Plan” (which was echoed by Exeter City Council in turn).Instead of making clear that the current (and final) consultation is actually only about the narrow subset of questions (complete with suppressed premises) to which it invited the Devon Climate Assembly to respond, it recently invited residents “to give their views on the Devon Carbon Plan before it gets published this summer”.This follows its decision to scrap the planned public consultation on the draft plan altogether.Those who nevertheless wish to take part have until 14 April to respond to a choice of short or full-length questionnaires. There’s a handy 48 page PDF which also glosses over various other ways in which the public has been excluded from the plan development process.RIFF ON ROADAnother Devon County Council active travel consultation is also under way, this time concerning a segregated cycle route instead of the substandard line-painting approach the local transport authority has recently followed elsewhere in Exeter.It will run along Rifford Road, which connects Burnthouse Lane with Honiton Road at the foot of East Wonford Hill, and will link the two ends of the E12 North-South cycle route.The online consultation runs until 22 April, and there is also an opportunity to air your views in person at a drop-in session next Thursday 7 April from 10am-12pm at Wonford Community Centre. County transport officers will on hand to field reactions to the loss of seventeen car parking spaces that the scheme entails.ON OUR READING LISTTHE BLEAKEST ASSESSMENT YET OF CLIMATE CHANGE RISKThat’s the second instalment (Working Group II) of the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, according to the Met Office.The message could hardly be clearer. The report’s authors said: “Targeting a climate resilient, sustainable world involves fundamental changes to how society functions including changes to underlying values, world-views, ideologies, social structures, political and economic systems and power relationships.”IPCC chair Hoesung Lee said: “This report is a dire warning about the consequences of inaction. Half measures are no longer an option.” And working group co-chair Debra Roberts added: “Tackling all these different challenges involves everyone – governments, the private sector, civil society – working together to prioritise risk reduction, as well as equity and justice, in decision-making and investment.”Summary here and full report here.ISN’T GLOBAL BRITAIN LEADING THE WAY?Not according to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. It says: “The government has unveiled a plan without answers to the key questions of how it will fund the transition to net zero, including how it will deliver policy on and replace income from taxes such as fuel duty, or even a general direction of travel on levies and taxation.“The government has no reliable estimate of what the process of implementing the net zero policy is actually likely to cost British consumers, households, businesses and government itself. It has much more work to do to understand the emissions impact of international supply chains, including the risk of domestic emissions being only window dressing if these are merely shifting emissions offshore to other countries.”Summary here and full report here.LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE COMINGAs the pre-election period begins in Exeter, the Electoral Reform Society had made a bracing intervention on the parlous state of local government in England, which it says “remains one of the most centralised nations in Europe as measured by the local control of resources and over-dependence on Whitehall decision making.”A remarkable table taken from a House of Commons Library research briefing captures striking contrasts with our European neighbours. While there is one local councillor in France for every 130 people, in England the ratio is one to 3,300.SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT JOURNALISMThere are lots of ways you can help Exeter Observer to thrive:      Share this newsletter with your friends and family and encourage them to subscribe free.

"content" : "Exeter City Council has announced an ambitious plan for a network of Alpine-style cable cars to connect key city sites as an alternative to traffic improvement measures.Developed by Exeter City Futures, the council’s vehicle for high-concept solutions to the city’s congestion challenges, the plan would see pods carrying up to 30 people each travelling above the streets suspended from cables.The council said the network of Pods in Exeter’s Sky will extend the city’s Liveable Exeter garden communities brand concept to include its “cheeky little hills”.The cable car network will boast two lines. The first will run from St David’s station to the new bus station via New North Road, with stops at the Clock Tower and the prison. A second line, referred to as BS2, will start at the bus station and terminate at Whipton &amp;amp; Pinhoe Labour club.Stops will take the form of fixed covered platforms at cable level linked to the street by lifts.The first line is expected to open to passengers in 2032. Final costs have yet to be revealed but a consultant working for Exeter City Futures was confident that the project could be delivered for “somewhere around £1 billion, with no risk at all to the council’s finances”.The network of Pods in Exeter’s Sky will extend the city’s Liveable Exeter garden communities brand concept to include its “cheeky little hills”.

After decades of inaction by Devon County Council, the so-called local transport authority, it’s time for the people of Exeter to let rhetoric go to their heads.“Liveable Exeter is more than just a property development programme. At its heart it is about community, well being and gambling with public land and money.“Exeter City Council is about to open a swimming pool which cost the city just £44 million. St Sidwell’s Point demonstrates that money is no object when delivering the world-class facilities demanded by Exeter residents.“The same community-driven value for money approach has been applied to this exciting new transport project, which will make a major contribution to achieving the city’s net zero 2030 target while generating untold economic benefits for the area.“It is the perfect sustainable transport solution for Exeter, even though nobody had heard about it before today, and will provide the infrastructure needed to attract wealthy incomers from the South East and improve their quality of life.”The council is planning a special season of musicals to promote the new cable car network, with tie-ins to established Exeter attractions.

But not before Roli Martin, also pitching for Exeter City Futures, said he had no idea."

"content" : "Council-owned companies have proliferated in recent years as local authorities across the country have pursued a wide range of commercial activities in response to pressures on their finances.For its part Exeter City Council, with town planner Karime Hassan as chief executive, is seeking to profit from property development via its wholly-owned subsidiary Exeter City Living Ltd.Last week Exeter Observer examined apparent breaches of local government legislation in council decisions to spend up to £55 million on the purchase and redevelopment of Guildhall shopping centre and to send its chief executive and another senior director to work for Exeter City Futures. Decisions taken in breach of the regulations may be unlawful and ineffective, could constitute maladministration and may be subject to judicial review, putting the council at risk.To explore exposure to similar risks elsewhere in Exeter City Council decision-making we examined all the significant decisions it has so far made regarding Exeter City Living’s financial, operational and development plans — a mix of business case and business plan production and loan and site sale approvals.We found that most of these decisions also apparently breached local government regulations intended to protect the public interest in the use of public land and money particularly when, as is the case in Exeter, the council is the planning authority and intends to develop its own property.We also found governance arrangements which appear to have undermined effective scrutiny of decision-making about the company, as well as decisions that have been made without any scrutiny at all.  Who might take legal action over the council’s development decisions?  Private sector property developers with in-house legal teams who may not like the council’s plans to dominate Exeter residential development?  Community campaigners who are incensed at the council’s decision to redevelop Harlequins shopping centre for student accommodation and may want to contest its development plans elsewhere, especially in the Exe valley?  Liveable Exeter development site owners who may want to challenge the compulsory purchase of their property under the New Development Corporation powers the council says it will use when it acquires them?While public access to local authority meetings and documents is required by law, there are allowances for councils to exclude the public from parts of their meetings, and withhold related information, in specific circumstances in which the public interest is better served by denying public access than allowing it.But there is an important exception which directly affects Exeter City Living.The public cannot be excluded from part of a meeting, and information cannot be exempt from disclosure, if “it relates to proposed development for which the local planning authority may grant itself planning permission, or permission in principle, pursuant to regulation 3 of the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992”. (Regulation 3 prescribes the rules local authorities must follow when they develop their own land.)This exception is not qualified by a public interest test (although disclosure of any personally-identifying information is always restricted under data protection law).  Proposed development  Part 1 - Descriptions of Exempt Information: England  3. Information relating to the financial or business affairs of any particular person (including the authority holding that information).  Part 2 - Qualifications: England  9. Information is not exempt information if it relates to proposed development for which the local planning authority may grant itself planning permission or permission in principle pursuant to regulation 3 of the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992.  10. Information which —  (a) falls within any of paragraphs 1 to 7 above; and  (b) is not prevented from being exempt by virtue of number 8 or 9 above,  is exempt information if, and so long as, in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in maintaining the exemption outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.  From: Local Government Act 1972, Schedule 12A - Access to information: exempt information.Local authorities are also required to publish at least 28 clear days’ notice of their intention to hold any part of an executive meeting in private, which the public can challenge by making representations as to why the meeting should instead be held openly.In addition, councils must separately publish 28 clear days’ notice of any executive decision which is a “key decision”.Government guidance reinforces the effect of these combined constraints when it says: “Transparency and openness should be the fundamental principle behind everything councils and other local government bodies do”.It also says: “Local authorities should start from the presumption of openness and disclosure of information, and not rely on exemptions to withhold information unless absolutely necessary.”Exeter City Council nevertheless routinely excludes the public from meetings which discuss Exeter City Living, and withholds related information, insisting that the rules about proposed development only apply when meetings relate to applications for planning permission and that the rules about private meetings only apply when the executive is making decisions.  Access to meetings and documents of a council’s executive  How will I know about a private meeting of my council’s executive?  Prior to holding a private meeting, your council must have published on its website and at its offices at least 28 clear days’ notice of its intention to consider a matter in private and the reasons for the private meeting.  This is to ensure that members of the public have reasonable opportunity to make representations as to why the proposed private meeting should not be held in private.  At least 5 clear days before the meeting, your council must confirm its intention to go ahead with the private meeting through another notice on its website and at its offices.  This second notice has to include details of any representations received and the council’s response to them.  Apart from information about meetings, are there other means of knowing about decisions likely to be made by a council’s executive, its committees and subcommittees?  Yes. The national rules require a council to publish its intention to make a key decision in a document at least 28 clear days prior to when the decision is intended to be made.  The notice has to include details of the individual or executive body that will make the decision, the matter that is subject to a decision, other documents to be considered, and where these other documents are available.  From: Open and accountable local government - Plain English Guide, Department of Communities and Local Government, August 2014.Exeter City Council initially made most of its decisions about Exeter City Living in public. It approved £350,000 for a company feasibility study this way in October 2016, then just over £260,000 for business case preparation and company formation in February 2018.In July 2018 it approved a loan of £4.25 million to the newly-formed company as well as a business plan detailing its proposed operational activities and development works to March 2019. A council committee had scrutinised the plans, partly in private, but the substance of the decision was made in public with only limited redaction of sensitive financial information in compliance with the law.The late Pete Edwards, then council leader, made clear at the time that the council would continue with this approach. He said: “The business case and annual business plans would be subject to the same presumption in favour of being made publicly available” with only limited, legally compliant exceptions to cover sensitive financial information.However by February 2019 things had changed. The council approved another loan to the company, this time for £5 million for “business operations and development activity”, and the company’s 2019-20 business plan, which laid out its intended “operational activities and development works”.This decision was taken in private without 28 days’ clear notice, and the company’s 2019-20 business plan was not published at all.Three months later Phil Bialyk proposed dramatic cuts to executive decision-making scrutiny at his first executive meeting as the new council leader.The changes swept away the council’s previous approach to scrutiny, which had been praised by the Local Government Association, and removed opposition leaders from its executive so it became exclusively composed of Labour councillors.The council’s scrutiny committees were already chaired by Labour members, as is the board which controls scrutiny committee agendas, which meets in private and does not publish its proceedings. Labour also holds 28 of 39 seats on the full council.The council has since sought to take all its decisions about Exeter City Living in private.Council leader Phil Bialyk cutting executive decision-making scrutiny, with council chief executive Karime Hassan.Two months after the scrutiny cuts were finalised in October 2019 the council published notices of its intention to hold two parts of its January executive meeting in private. One concerned a “Clifton Hill site report” and the other a “Special Report on Clifton Hill”. No more details were provided about the first, and the second only said: “Report from the Director (DB) on Clifton Hill”.The reality was that the first was to approve a £16 million loan to Exeter City Living for the controversial redevelopment of the Clifton Hill sports centre site and the second was to approve the sale of the site at a discount of more than £2 million to the company.The notices were published on 17 December 2019, less than 28 days’ clear of the meeting. Neither provided sufficient details to make representations as to why the meeting should be held openly. Neither should have been heard in private to the extent they related to proposed development.Clifton Hill sport centre development site: Exeter City Living intends construction of 42 housing units here, some for sale for more than £800,000, but the centre closed four years ago and redevelopment work is still not expected to begin for several more months.Three months later the council published notice of another private executive meeting, this time to approve “Funding for the business case for Exeter City Living”. No more details were supplied.The reality was that the meeting approved £360,000 for the development of business cases for three subsidiary companies: a market rent property management company, a consultancy company and a retrofit company.Less than 28 days’ clear notice was given of the intention to discuss this in private, which it should not have been to the extent it related to proposed development.As the business case funding was to come from existing budgets and service level agreements it appears the decision should have been taken by the executive instead of the full council. In which case it should also have been classified as a key decision, for which 28 days’ clear notice should separately have been given as, according to the council, it affected all electoral wards.  Key decisions  (1) In these Regulations a “key decision” means an executive decision, which is likely —  (a) to result in the relevant local authority incurring expenditure which is, or the making of savings which are, significant having regard to the relevant local authority’s budget for the service or function to which the decision relates; or  (b) to be significant in terms of its effects on communities living or working in an area comprising two or more wards or electoral divisions in the area of the relevant local authority.  From: The Local Authorities (Executive Arrangements) (Meetings and Access to Information) (England) Regulations 2012, Part 3, Regulation 8.Then in June 2020 the council published notice that its July executive meeting would discuss Exeter City Living’s 2020-21 business plan in private.The meeting was also scheduled to discuss “Governance for Exeter City Group” (Exeter City Living’s parent company) but despite the decision being recorded the chair said the item had been withdrawn. It subsequently reappeared, in different form and without notice attached, at the September executive meeting.Less than 28 days’ clear notice was given of the intention to hear these items in private, which the first should not have been to the extent it related to proposed development and insufficient details were provided to make representations as to why they should have been heard openly.Belle Isle park depot development site: Exeter City Living has been awarded £675,000 from the government’s Brownfield Land Release Fund to enable construction of 46 housing units here. The council has also allocated £3.5 million to the cost of relocating the depot to its facility at Exton Road.In September last year the council’s executive decided to sell the depot at Belle Isle park for £2.2 million to Exeter City Living for development as per the company’s business plan.Plenty of notice was given of the intention to hold the meeting in private this time, but to the extent the decision related to proposed development it should not have been. The notice described the item as “Belle Isle Depot - Report on the Belle Isle Depot”.The notice said nothing about the sale and no connection was made with the council’s separate decision to allocate £3.5 million to the cost of relocating the depot, without which the development would not be possible.Nor was anything said about the council’s application for £675,000 towards the development from the government Brownfield Land Release Fund. The application, which included a detailed viability assessment of the development proposals, was submitted in June, before either depot relocation or site sale decision was made.Then in February this year the council’s executive discussed Exeter City Living’s 2022-23 business plan and the previously-funded business case for a market rent property management company. It again met in private to do so despite both items relating to proposed development which had also been set out in detail in its June 2021 Brownfield Land Release Fund application.Vaughan Road development site: Exeter City Living intends to oversee construction of 60 council and 32 market rent units here at a cost of £9.2 million. Demolition is under way but the development contractor has withdrawn “due to current market conditions” so delivery “has yet to be finalised”.The council has also made three significant Exeter City Living-related decisions without publishing how and when they were taken. We asked it to explain each of them.One was the decision to “pause the requirement to deliver a 2021-22 business plan as there were no additional sites or additional financial implications to be considered”. The council told us that its chief executive took this decision in private in March 2021 in consultation with the chief financial officer, council leader and relevant portfolio holders.It said this was because the company’s 2020-21 business plan had not been adopted until July 2020 and “it was not practicable or a good use of resources to undertake the work for a new business plan when the 2020-21 business plan had still to be implemented and no new sites or funding were required for the 2021-2022 business plan period”.The others were the decisions not to pursue the subsidiary consultancy or retrofit companies to which a share of the previously-approved £300,000 business case development funding had been allocated.The council’s chief executive, who has been the council’s Exeter City Group Shareholder Representative since September 2020, took both these decisions in private on 19 April 2021.The council says the powers it delegated to the Shareholder Representative immediately after incorporating the companies were sufficient to have taken these decisions like this. However we cannot find any reference to them in the company management agreement delegation scheme.Exeter City Group delegation scheme detailing which decisions can be taken by company directors, which by the council’s Shareholder Representative and which by the full council.Whether this delegation scheme is consistent with the legislation that defines the council’s executive decision-making structure is also unclear.It says the full council should take decisions which do not appear to involve departure from the council’s budget and policy framework, which would mean they should be taken by the executive instead, and in doing so appears to undermine the powers which backbench councillors sitting on scrutiny committees would otherwise be able to invoke to hold executive decisions about Exeter City Living to account.These include powers to “call in” executive decisions, delaying their implementation so they can be subjected to greater scrutiny, with the option to recommend that they are reconsidered and potentially overturned, and enhanced powers to access exempt or confidential information beyond those which councillors already have.The government says that “the role that overview and scrutiny can play in holding an authority’s decision-makers to account makes it fundamentally important to the successful functioning of local democracy”.That role appears to be compromised by either the full council or the Shareholder Representative taking decisions about Exeter City Living that might more properly be the responsibility of the executive instead.  Relating to proposed development?  Exeter City Living’s 2020-21 business plan summarised the company’s intention to:      complete the Hockings Green development    continue with design then construction works at Clifton Hill sports centre    continue pre-construction activities at Vaughan Road    undertake development planning activities on new sites    progress project delivery for the council on several schemes    and included a delivery programme for sites at or near:      Hockings Green    Clifton Hill sports centre    Vaughan Road    Mary Arches car park    Belle Isle park depot    Bonhay Meadows    Exeter canal basin    Cathedral &amp;amp; Quay car park    Magdalen Road car park    Glasshouse Lane    Exeter Arena    Exeter Golf &amp;amp; Country Club.  Exeter Observer has been challenging the council over these issues since we became aware of them. We objected to the private decision to sell Belle Isle park depot last September then raised this decision again, as well as the Guildhall shopping centre decision, at a meeting with council officials in October.We attended two further meetings with officials in November when we raised these issues again and followed up in December in writing, as requested, explaining our concerns about the council’s potential exposure to risk, referring to the relevant legislation and citing examples of other local authorities which correctly implement the notice regulations.Then in January we submitted detailed representations objecting to Exeter City Living’s 2022-23 business plan and the business case for a market rent property management company, both of which are related to proposed development, being discussed in private.This time the council said our representations would be included on the meeting agenda, with the council’s response, which would be that neither related to an application for planning permission and both concerned the council’s financial affairs. It also said the public interest would be better served by denying access than allowing it.Hamlin Gardens development site: the council approved a budget of £4 million for a four storey block of 21 flats here in October 2019, with Exeter City Living as its development agent, but had to increase the budget by £1.3 million last month in response to rising costs. Work has yet to begin.When the meeting took place, the council leader suddenly announced both decisions would be deferred, although there is no mention of this in the minutes. Our representations have since been deleted from the agenda on the council website.We submitted new, more comprehensive representations objecting to the executive discussing these items in private when it reconvened. The council again confirmed they would be included on the meeting agenda.When it was subsequently published they were not. The council instead republished our previous objections, which did not include our response to the council’s interpretation of the regulations.We asked the council what had happened, and were told it was an error which would be rectified by the republication of the agenda.Instead, however, the council separately published an agenda supplement without updating the original agenda or the reports pack that went with it.No mention of our representations was included in the decisions statement or the minutes that followed, and they have since been deleted from the agenda on the council’s website too.The council published our representations, and its response, as an agenda supplement which was not attached to the rest of the executive meeting papers.The meeting minutes confirm, however, that both items related to proposed development. The first item sought “approval to move into an ambitious delivery phase, with over 426 new homes in the development of nine Exeter City Living sites and a further 150-250 new homes on four Housing Revenue Account [council housing] sites”.It said that the chief executive “explained that the report provided a timeline for the delivery of new homes” and that “he set out the proposed scenario for developing five sites already identified”. The recommendations referred to “a committed development pipeline” and “the timeline for the development programme”.The second item referred to a business case “financial model developed with actual projects costs and actual incomes” based on “planned activities [and] deliverables”.The minutes also record that the council’s Director Corporate Services, Baan Al-Khafaji, advised the executive on its response to these objections. She is also a director of Exeter City Living Ltd and its parent company, Exeter City Group Ltd (as is the council’s Section 151 officer).As a company director she has a legal obligation to act in the interests of each company, and as a council director she has a legal obligation to act in the interests of the council. While the council owns both companies, the companies’ interests are not necessarily aligned with the council’s. In such circumstances her advice would constitute a conflict of interest.Baan Al-Khafaji is also the council’s monitoring officer, who we were told would be investigating the issues we raised in detail in writing in December after our meetings with council officials. More than three months have passed since then and we have yet to receive a response.

Emphasises importance of up-to-date annual business plans and avoiding conflicts of interest entailed by individuals acting as representatives of both company and council.  Specifically says Section 151 officers should not hold such positions.    CIPFA — Council-owned Companies Guidance  Due in the next fortnight. Will focus on governance and effective financial management of council-owned companies to protect public services. Identifies risks including:      lack of understanding of roles and responsibilities    lack of commercial decision-making skills    optimism bias that does not reflect the true position    lack of strategic rationale surrounding company creation    reluctance to listen to challenges.    On every occasion the council has held private meetings to discuss Exeter City Living it has cited the same exemption to justify doing so: the disclosure of information relating to the financial or business affairs of the council or company.The scope of this exemption, even when proposed development is not being discussed, is limited by the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Act prompted a major revision of the local government information transparency provisions when it came into force, since when it has determined their extent.Information access judgements have further reduced the scope of this exemption over time. Simply referring to a risk of reduced profits or impaired negotiating ability may no longer be sufficient to engage it, and the public interest in matters involving spatial development and decision-making in general have significant weight.In particular, disclosure of headline information such as the sale or rental value of housing resulting from development has been judged not to harm developers’ commercial interests as market rates on completion are held to be much more significant.Minor information such as the value of individual subcontracts may be judged to be commercially sensitive, but only where the sensitivity of each element is demonstrated in detail.Anthony Road: Exeter City Living oversaw construction of three 3-bed houses here intending to sell them on the open market but when they remained unsold Exeter City Council bought them for £900,000 for council housing instead.In addition, the extent to which Exeter City Living is a commercial company, and so the extent to which its affairs can be considered commercially sensitive, is restricted by its local authority-owned “Teckal” status which largely prohibits it from trading on the open market.The company borrows money from the council to buy council land which is not offered for open sale, sometimes at preferential rates, and to commission the construction of houses all of which have so far been sold back to the council. Or it is commissioned directly by the council (via its Teckal exemption from EU procurement rules) to build council housing on council land.The council directs the company and determines its viability, paying development and planning costs and providing privileged access to finance and land while allocating significant public expenditure to support its plans which does not appear on the company’s balance sheet.The company also receives government grants as a council subsidiary and has yet to sell or rent any housing on the open market.Hockings Green: Exeter City Living oversaw construction of nine 3-bed council houses here at a cost of £2.6 million.Instead of simply claiming blanket commercial confidentiality for all information relating to Exeter City Living, the council should disclose all but very granular information, as promised by its leader when the company was set up.The sensitivity of the information it does not disclose should be demonstrated in detail in the context of the company’s essentially non-commercial operations to avoid breaching local government transparency regulations and so putting related decisions at risk.Headline information such as the projected price of housing for sale or rent that the council is building in Exeter is precisely the information that the public interest demands should be disclosed, to enable public consideration of whether Exeter City Living is delivering best value in its use of public land and money.The council has so far allocated nearly £1 million to the company for start up and planning costs, loaned it nearly £25 million for development delivery, gifted it more than £2 million in land purchase discounts and commissioned or purchased just over £20 million of housing.The company has also been granted more than £7 million of central government financial support, yet it has so far completed just 22 housing units.There are more in the company’s development pipeline, but it has already taken more than five years to get this far. Is this “building at pace and scale” as the council’s chief executive says? Will the company “disrupt the private rental market in Exeter” as the council leader says?With 57,000 dwellings in Exeter, of which 11,000 are estimated to be privately rented, the company is currently a long way short of doing either.Bovemoors Lane: Exeter City Living oversaw construction of ten 3-bed council houses here with ‘B’ grade energy ratings (the same as Anthony Road and Hockings Green) at a cost of £2.08 million.Exeter City Living’s financing, activities and development plans are of vital public interest, both because local voters are entitled to know what the council is doing with public land and money and because of potential exposure to risk, not only from decisions that may breach local government legislation but also from wider challenges the company may face.Development sector risks are all too apparent in the recent bankruptcy of Midas, which was headquartered at Pynes Hill, following its first loss in 40 years of trading on revenue of £291 million. Brexit, the coronavirus pandemic, labour shortages and materials price inflation, all of which it said brought it down, continue to affect every construction company in the country.But there also is rising concern over the risks associated with council-owned companies more generally. Last year local authority auditor Grant Thornton reviewed three recent Reports in the Public Interest which addressed major financial problems at councils in Croydon, Northampton and Nottingham.Nottingham City Council had made large losses with a wholly-owned energy company as a result of inadequate governance arrangements which Grant Thornton said had “led to institutional blindness” which downplayed the concerns that had been raised.In its review the auditor highlighted the risk of optimism bias in local authority management of public money and criticised council pursuit of political objectives without effective scrutiny. It said these can lead to failures to understand the risks of embarking on complex, major projects without appropriate due diligence.It emphasised the value of decision-making scrutiny and the importance of councils being willing to accept challenges. Citing the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee as a model for scrutiny rigour, it said its key characteristic is that “it is chaired by a member of the official opposition and its members, of all political parties, are required to demonstrate robust challenge”.

A criminal investigation may follow.The auditor’s findings echoed previous government guidance identifying indicators of weak local authority governance.These included inadequate scrutiny, transparency and public consultation and a lack of awareness and acceptance of the need for improvement, citing examples in which scrutiny had been weakened by council domination by one political party and lack of transparency in decision-making processes."

"content" : "Consultants commissioned by Exeter City Council to review Exeter’s Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) market have confirmed that 58% of Exeter’s university students rely on the city’s residential housing stock for term-time accommodation.Jones Lang LaSalle, a global property consultant with a specialist student housing team and offices in Exeter, was asked to provide an assessment to support the council’s application to scrap its own affordable housing requirement for its controversial Exeter City Living Clifton Hill sports centre site redevelopment.The assessment, obtained under freedom of information legislation, confirmed in September last year that the combination of university halls of residence and private sector PBSA was only able to provide residential accommodation for 42% of the university’s Exeter students in 2019-20.Figures published by the university (and confirmed by HESA) show that there has since been an astonishing 20% rise in Exeter student numbers, an increase of more than 4,500 to 27,276 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) students in the city.(FTE student numbers combine full-time and part-time students into a single total used for planning educational provision. This is lower than the number who require term-time accommodation because of the number of, particularly postgraduate, part-time students.)The university now has a total of more than 30,000 students at its Exeter and Penryn campuses, of whom 22% are international students from outside the EU, which may partly explain the huge rise in overseas ownership of Exeter property.The city council told us that a total of 11,488 university halls and private sector PBSA bedspaces had been built by the beginning of last year, enough to provide residential accommodation for 42% of the university’s 2021-22 Exeter students, the same proportion as two years ago.According to Professor Darren Smith of Loughborough University, who is known for coining the term “studentification” to describe the domination of residential neighbourhoods by student households (and who has twice been commissioned by the council to produce reports on the impact of increasing student numbers in Exeter), an average of 3.5 students share a typical student House in Multiple Occupation (HMO).This would mean that nearly 16,000 students currently live in more than 4,500 HMOs in Exeter which could otherwise be used for residential housing by local people.This is consistent with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) finding that only half of all student addresses are revealed by student council tax exemption data.Exeter City Council recorded 2,432 such council tax exemptions in the city’s residential housing stock in 2021, which may mean the current number of student HMOs is even higher.

Subscribe freeThe city council also told us that a pipeline of another 2,500 student bedspaces (of which nearly half will be provided by the Clydesdale, Nash &amp;amp; Birks Grange Village redevelopment alone) will increase the total to nearly 14,000.But this includes schemes that have not yet received full planning consent and schemes on which development work has not yet begun.If the remaining schemes are completed by the beginning of next academic year, six months from now, and the university has another year of growth like this one, PBSA will still only provide 42% of the Exeter term-time accommodation needed by just over 30,000 students of whom more than 17,500 will expect to seek accommodation in what will be more than 5,000 HMOs.In other words another 500 dwellings will be lost from Exeter’s residential housing stock and the number of student HMOs will overtake the number of council houses in the city."

"content" : "At the end of last year Exeter City Council controversially decided to send its chief executive, Karime Hassan, and another senior director, Jo Yelland, to work for Exeter City Futures for a total of five days a week while continuing to receive their council salaries.The decision was ostensibly taken to support Net Zero Exeter plan delivery, although both are expected to focus on enabling Exeter Development Fund.Neither the rationale nor the risk assessment provided by council leader Phil Bialyk in his report recommending the decision stood up to scrutiny.It subsequently emerged that a cross-party group of backbench councillors attempted to challenge the decision under local government scrutiny call-in powers, but were told they could not do so.The council claimed that the decision was for the full council, not its executive, to make and so was not subject to call-in.However local government legislation appears to say otherwise, which would make the decision unlawful, ineffective and subject to judicial review.Exeter City Council in session at Exeter Guildhall. Photo: © Sandra Barrett, All Rights Reserved.The legislation that governs Exeter City Council decision-making requires full council meetings to determine overall policy frameworks and budgets which its executive then implements (sometimes via executive sub-committees or council members and officials using delegated powers).Accompanying regulations specify what local authority executives may do, what they may not do, and what they may only do in conjunction with the full council.Backbench councillors are responsible for holding executive decisions and their implementation to account in scrutiny committees on which executive members may not sit.Some other council decisions concerning regulatory matters including audit, planning and licensing are mostly made by non-executive committees.Backbench councillors sitting on scrutiny committees have legal powers to “call in” executive decisions, delaying their implementation so they can be subjected to greater scrutiny, with the option to recommend that they are reconsidered and potentially overturned.Statutory government guidance says that all council “members and officers should recognise and appreciate the importance and legitimacy the scrutiny function is afforded by the law”. It describes scrutiny as a “check and balance on the executive”.  Key decisions  (1) In these Regulations a “key decision” means an executive decision, which is likely —  (a) to result in the relevant local authority incurring expenditure which is, or the making of savings which are, significant having regard to the relevant local authority’s budget for the service or function to which the decision relates; or  (b) to be significant in terms of its effects on communities living or working in an area comprising two or more wards or electoral divisions in the area of the relevant local authority.  Extracts from: The Local Authorities (Executive Arrangements) (Meetings and Access to Information) (England) Regulations 2012, Part 3, Regulation 8.Executive decisions which are likely to result in significant expenditure (or savings) against council-set budgets , or which are likely to have a significant effect on communities living or working in an area comprising two or more council electoral wards are called “key decisions”.What constitutes “significant” in this context is not defined by the regulations. Many local authorities consider expenditure (or savings) of £100,000 or more to be significant, although Exeter City Council only applies this to expenditure above £1 million. The meaning of “significant effect on communities” is less clear.Somewhat confusingly, local authority executives may also make decisions which involve significant expenditure but are nevertheless not key decisions, because the executive is restricted to recommending its decision to the full council for approval.These are decisions which would be “contrary to or not wholly in accordance with the authority’s budget” or “contrary to a plan or strategy adopted or approved by the authority”. They are known as “departure decisions” and must be made by the full council.  Exeter City Council policy framework  The policy framework is made up of a series of statutory plans and strategies as follows:      Corporate Plan    Development Plan Documents forming the Local Development Framework    Food Law Enforcement Service Plan    Climate Change Strategy    Contaminated Land Strategy    Annual Budget Strategy    Asset Management Plan    Health and Safety Service Plan    Housing Strategy (including Private Sector Housing Renewal Policy)    Anti-Social Behaviour Policy    Homelessness Strategy    Community Safety Strategy    Recycling Plan    Licensing Policy Statement    Gambling Policy Statement.    Extracts from: Exeter City Council constitution, Article 4.The decision to send two council directors to work for Exeter City Futures relied on existing budgets, as the council leader’s report confirms, and it was not related to the council’s current policy framework, as the council’s constitution confirms.As the decision involved neither budget nor policy framework changes it appears not to be departure decision. If so, it should have been taken by the executive and not the full council.It apparently should also have been classified as a key decision as, according to the council, it affected all the city’s electoral wards.As such it should have been subject to call-in too. However the non-partisan cross-party group of backbench councillors which attempted to challenge the decision under scrutiny call-in powers was prevented from doing so by the council on the basis that the decision was not an executive decision at all.The local government legislation which binds the council appears to say otherwise, which would make the decision unlawful, ineffective and subject to judicial review.

The council therefore has no powers to appoint the company’s staff, whether already employed by the council or anyone else."

"content" : "A community-led resource hub is opening in Exeter today to support Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion in search of new homes in the UK.The pop-up hub is housed in an empty Princesshay shopping centre retail unit at No.6 Paris Street where it is open from 10am to 4pm daily.It offers information and resources for people directly affected by the Ukraine crisis as well as those who wish to help them, and will act as a focal point for refugees as they arrive.The Conversation Café intends to cut through the confusion surrounding the government’s new Homes for Ukraine scheme by offering reliable advice on how to approach it, with Ukrainian and Russian speakers available to help directly connect Devon residents with refugees.The new Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme follows intense criticism of the government’s Ukraine Family Scheme, which is restricted to applicants with a UK-based family member.However while the new scheme offers a £350 per month grant to those housing Ukrainian refugees, it does not include a system to match them with the 150,000 households that signed up when it opened at the weekend.Despite expectations that hundreds of thousands of refugees will arrive in the UK in the next few weeks, the scheme’s sponsorship system also places barriers in the way of people fleeing war who may not possess all the documents and the high levels of English fluency required to apply.UK refugee charities have been asked to become matching organisations without being told what the scheme involves, and local authorities are expected to take responsibility for grant payments and accommodation and safeguarding checks without being given further details.Exeter City Council’s website currently simply redirects prospective hosts to register for the scheme on the government website, and the county council’s advice is similar.The sponsorship scheme requires UK residents who want to house Ukrainian refugees to either contact them directly or rely on ad hoc matching mechanisms which are springing up to connect them.Some matching services are administered by national refugee charities while others are being organised by local faith or community groups.These include Exeter Friends of Ukraine, set up recently by local resident Shannon McGinley. As well as helping connect Ukrainian refugees with Exeter hosts, the group’s members, many of whom are Ukrainian, organise collections of food, medicine and other essentials then transport them directly to where they are needed on the ground.The Za Rogiem Polish shop in South Street has been collecting supplies since the first day of the war, Parrs Farm in Matford has donated a large barn to store and sort donations and Blessed Sacrament church in Heavitree is acting as a collection point. Catholic Exeter is considering sending a driver and van of its own.There are similar groups across the county, including Devon for Ukraine and Devon for Ukrainian Refugees.The Paris Street Conversation Café resource hub is the latest extension of this network of committed local volunteers, offering in-person access to the experience and insight they have gained in the 28 days since the war began.It also provides a place for people to meet and extend their crisis support networks, and intends to raise awareness and money with talks, screenings, readings and art-making for all ages, a café supplied by Exe Coffee Roasters and The Sidwell Street Bakehouse and works donated for sale by local artists.Visitors can also learn about Ukrainian history, culture and language while refugees will be given support with learning English.

Subscribe freeThe volunteer-run hub has been put together by Olya Petrakova, Director of Maketank, an artists’ collective which has transformed an empty furniture shop on the other side of Paris Street into a three-storey creative and performance space.She is emblematic of the complex identities of many in the region now under threat, and a reminder of the importance of not confusing the Russian language with Russian nationality or either with the actions of the Russian state.She was born in the former Soviet Union in what is now Moldova and speaks Russian as her first language. Her mother was born in what is now Ukraine and her father in Russia. She studied in Saint Petersburg before leaving for the US, where she remains a citizen, just a few weeks before Moldova became an independent state.Exeter Community Alliance also contributed to the creation of the new hub. It is a group of 28 local organisations which is in the process of setting up a permanent resource and information centre in the city centre.Its member organisations are focussed on a wide range of issues including climate change, biodiversity and social justice.The Ukrainian refugee support hub will initially operate from No.6 Paris Street before either moving to another empty Paris Street retail unit or finding a new home at Maketank."

"content" : "The final bill for the new St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre has not yet been published, but was already expected to reach £42 million by this time last year. Since then costs have risen and the total is likely to be significantly higher.Exeter City Council nevertheless decided to purchase and redevelop the Guildhall shopping centre in October, at an expected cost of £55 million, to include the construction of new build to rent accommodation above the retail space.The council took the decision in private, apparently without complying with local government transparency regulations.It already owned the freehold interest in the 300,000 square feet shopping centre: the purchase involved the leasehold interest, which includes the 440 space multi-storey Paul Street car park.Apart from the public interest in the use of public money which local government transparency regulations are intended to protect, decisions taken in breach of these regulations may be unlawful and ineffective, could constitute maladministration and may be subject to judicial review, placing the council’s finances at risk.Local authorities are required by law to publish at least 28 clear days’ notice of their intention to hold any part of an executive meeting in private. Such notices must include an explanation of the reasons for holding the meeting in private and details of the issue to be discussed.The rules also entitle anyone to make representations as to why the meeting should be open to the public, based on those details. Then, at least five clear days before the meeting, the local authority must publish another notice which must include its justification for excluding the public, any representations received and the council’s response to those representations.When the meeting is convened its voting members (who are all elected councillors) must then decide whether to hold it in private or not.The government said it introduced the current rules because the previous regulations “resulted in more meetings being held in private than could be properly justified on the basis of well founded reasons”.It added that the new regulations “materially strengthen transparency and openness, by providing a clear presumption that all meetings of the executives, their committees or sub committees, must be held in public except in limited prescribed circumstances”.  Access to meetings and documents of a council’s executive  How will I know about a private meeting of my council’s executive?  Prior to holding a private meeting, your council must have published on its website and at its offices at least 28 clear days’ notice of its intention to consider a matter in private and the reasons for the private meeting.  This is to ensure that members of the public have reasonable opportunity to make representations as to why the proposed private meeting should not be held in private.  At least 5 clear days before the meeting, your council must confirm its intention to go ahead with the private meeting through another notice on its website and at its offices.  This second notice has to include details of any representations received and the council’s response to them.  Extracts from: Open and accountable local government - Plain English Guide, Department of Communities and Local Government, August 2014.The £55 million Guildhall shopping centre decision was recommended by an executive meeting on 5 October last year before being approved at a meeting of the full council on 18 October. Both meetings discussed the matter in private.However notice of the council’s intention to exclude the press and public from the executive meeting was not published until 24 September, just ten clear days before the meeting took place, and only 23 clear days before the council approved the executive’s recommendation.The only details provided by the notice were: “Acquisition of property to support Liveable Exeter - To consider the report of the Director Finance”. These do not supply sufficient “particulars of the matter”, as required by the legislation, to make representations as to why the meeting should not be held in private.We challenged the council on its failure to provide 28 days’ clear notice of the private meeting, but were told that it was not required. We also submitted representations objecting to the private meeting, but neither notice of these representations nor any response from the council was ever published.

The risks involved are considered to be severe in some cases.We now face of a cost of living crisis which is likely to see disposable incomes fall faster than they have for half a century with stagflation depressing the economy for years to come. The chancellor is unlikely to address the situation adequately in tomorrow’s spring statement.The end of pandemic business support, rising employers’ national insurance rates and staff shortages which show no sign of abating are also challenging retail and leisure businesses. And that’s without inflation that is likely to exceed 8%, perhaps more, by the end of the year.All those who back the council’s balance sheets via their council tax or business rates payments, or stand to bear the brunt of loss of public services, will be adversely affected if things go wrong.The public interest in council borrowing and investment, especially decisions involving such large sums of public money, could hardly be more pressing. The council should not be seeking to keep such decisions secret whether doing so breaches the regulations or not."

They also found that the much-vaunted railway station, which is more than 550 metres from the nearest housing, is not connected to the main development by bus.Transport for New Homes classifies Cranbrook as a “cowpat” development: new housing dropped on fields, built separately from the existing urban area to which it is not connected by continuous streets.HAS THE COUNTY COUNCIL LEARNED ITS LESSON? Judging by the “ample space” for greenfield business park and housing development promoted in the “Clean Growth Vision for the West of East Devon” it commissioned from City Science Corporation (an Exeter City Futures sister company) for submission to the East Devon Local Plan consultation, it seems not.Worryingly, Devon County Council says the document “provides the next level of detail beneath the Devon Carbon Plan” and expects it to “inspire other areas to create similar plans”. Get your complimentary Kool-Aid here then consider what this sort of thinking would mean for the new Exeter Local Plan.IN OTHER URBAN SPRAWL NEWS a development of up to 80 residential dwellings on a ten acre greenfield site alongside Exwick Lane has been given the go ahead at appeal. The city council refused the development in May last year on the grounds it would have a harmful visual impact on the Redhills ridgeline.The planning inspector rejected the council’s decision, concluding that the development would comply with the council’s planning policies. He said his judgement was not affected by the argument that it might provide a precedent for ridgeline development in other parts of Exeter.This did not deter the council leader, Phil Bialyk, from insisting that “Exeter protects the vital green ridge surrounding the city” in his budget speech on Tuesday.

Feedback on the proposed new parliamentary constituencies can be submitted until 4 April 2022 via the commission website, where the existing Exeter and East Devon constituency boundaries and the proposed changes are mapped alongside comments on the proposals.See Exeter Digest #5 for a summary of the Priory vs Pinhoe argument which led to the city council proposing to sacrifice the latter to an East Devon Conservative MP.Public hearings covering the whole South West region are planned in Exeter from 10am to 8pm on 21 March and 9am to 5pm on 22 March. They will take place at the Guildhall. Recordings and transcripts of the hearings will be made available afterwards.DEVOLUTION FOR DEVON? The prospect of county-level devolution has been entangled with the government’s “Levelling Up” agenda ever since the latter appeared in the Conservative Party’s 2019 general election manifesto.Multiple announcements, swirling rumours and contentious early moves to replace two-tier arrangements with unitary authorities in rural counties, particularly Somerset, have created considerable confusion around the policy.In Devon, overlapping bids were separately submitted by Plymouth City Council in partnership with West Devon and South Hams (see also their Joint Local Plan) and Devon County Council, which intends to take Plymouth &amp;amp; Co. under its wing. The Plymouth-led bid apparently surprised County Hall.Whether either bid would need to include a directly-elected Mayor has been unclear. Meanwhile leaked documents suggested the abolition of district councils (including Exeter City Council) might be on the cards too.The delayed “Levelling Up” white paper, published earlier this month, finally laid out the government’s (provisional) criteria for county deals. County council leader John Hart last week confirmed Devon would be pursuing a “level two” bid focussed on transport, skills and housing without requiring a county-wide Mayor. Negotiations with central government continue.ON OUR READING LISTTHE “LEVELLING UP” WHITE PAPER itself is not so much a challenge to read, at 332 pages plus regional breakdown plus technical annex, but it does pose a dilemma for potential readers: is it worth the attention?Given the criticism it has received it remains to be seen how much influence it will have on the ground, especially in the South West, which is far from the “red wall” on which the document’s political logic turns. Exeter appears just twice: the maths school and the “Exeter M5 Growth Corridor” each get a one-line mention.On the same day the white paper was published, the National Audit Office released a report panning the DLUHC’s performance around local growth policies and funding. It found the “evidence base for effective interventions is limited. The [DLUHC] therefore lacks evidence on whether the billions of pounds of public funding it has awarded to local bodies in the past for supporting local growth have had the impact intended. And it has wasted opportunities to learn which initiatives and interventions are most effective.”The Institute for Fiscal Studies also queried whether the government understands how to deliver the big picture targets which headline the white paper (and whether it even intends to try). Director Paul Johnson said they look “extremely ambitious - that is to say highly unlikely to be met, even with the best policies and much resource. There is little detail on how most of them will be met, and less detail on available funding. There is something for everyone, and hence little sense of prioritisation: ambition and resource will be spread very thin.”Bristol North West MP Darren Jones, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, compared the white paper’s headline “missions” with the now-defunct UK Industrial Strategy, and concluded the former had largely been cribbed from the latter. Other parts of the document were apparently copied from Wikipedia. Your mileage may vary.RATHER MORE RELEVANT TO EXETER is auditor Grant Thornton’s Report in the Public Interest on Croydon Council’s failed Brick by Brick development company. It identifies “serious corporate and governance failings” and “significant concerns regarding the decision making, value for money, behaviour and governance arrangements”, concluding that the council “failed to ensure it was acting lawfully”.It also said “the lack of properly executed written legal arrangements covering the provision of funding to Brick by Brick is in our view a very serious matter and demonstrates fundamental failings by the council.” The report has been handed to the police who are considering a criminal investigation.LAST BUT NOT LEAST everyone involved in UK public life should be paying attention to Edelman’s 2022 Trust Barometer, the company’s 22nd annual trust and credibility survey.It found that trust in government fell thirteen points, to just 29%, in the three months to the end of January this year alone, with only 15% now believing that the UK’s political system works in their favour. Only 31% think voting influences those in power, and a majority feel powerless to effect change.Nearly 60% think that politicians are more likely to lie or mislead compared to a year ago, up seven points, and two thirds think that they are undermining democracy through their actions. City and county councillors are on the hook too: trust in local government has declined at the same rate as trust in Whitehall.SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT PUBLIC INTEREST JOURNALISMThere are lots of ways you can help Exeter Observer to thrive:      Share this newsletter with your friends and family and encourage them to subscribe free.

"content" : "It is often said that the best way to understand a local authority’s priorities is to look at what its chief executive used to do before taking over.In Exeter City Council’s case, Chief Executive &amp;amp; Growth Director Karime Hassan’s trade as a town planner has been reflected in property development projects which have come to characterise the city, including Princesshay shopping centre and St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre.He is responsible for peripheral development too, including Cranbrook and several enterprise zone business parks which have contributed to the government’s description of the area as the “Exeter M5 Growth Corridor” in its recent Levelling Up white paper.It is often also observed that the chief executive’s Paris Street tenure has coincided with a reduction in council transparency, particularly where development is concerned.In recent years the council has convened a series of committees in private to make strategic decisions about the future of the city and its hinterland.Two years ago this trend reached its zenith (or nadir, depending on your point of view) when the city council agreed his proposal to convene the Liveable Exeter Place Board . He said it would provide “a forum in which to address collaboratively issues relating to housing delivery, place shaping, economic development, clean growth and carbon neutral development at a city and sub-regional level”.This unelected board also meets in private and does not publish its proceedings. It oversees the Liveable Exeter property development scheme for 12,000 new dwellings, which includes the planned redevelopment of Marsh Barton, the area around St David’s station and the Water Lane industrial estate.Liveable Exeter Place Board also receives regular reports from Exeter City Futures, which is ostensibly responsible for delivering city-wide decarbonisation but which has been prioritising a development fund, sponsored by central government, which is intended to finance the Liveable Exeter property development scheme.Exeter City Council Relocate to Exeter promo reelAt the beginning of last month Karime Hassan and Jo Yelland, another Exeter City Council director, both began working for Exeter City Futures. Exeter City Council decided just before Christmas that they should, between them, spend five days a week at the company while continuing to receive their council salaries.The decision was ostensibly taken to support Net Zero Exeter plan delivery. However neither the rationale nor the risk assessment provided by council leader Phil Bialyk in his report recommending the decision stand up to scrutiny.His report says that “many councils have shared their chief executive” but cites none in which a local authority CEO has been paid to work in the private sector.It says that Exeter City Futures “provides a vehicle for the partner organisations to take joint actions on behalf of the city of Exeter” without explaining how the company, which has neither statutory powers nor policy-making authority, might, for example, impose or enforce zero carbon development or a city-wide ultra low emission zone.It also claims that “Exeter City Futures is a mature vehicle for addressing challenges facing the city of Exeter” despite it not yet putting together a plan that could actually decarbonise the city, let alone enacting one, in the six years since it was incorporated.Exeter City Futures declared public funding to the end of 2022. Sources: Exeter City Council, Exeter City Futures.The council leader’s report also cites the importance of working with what it called the council’s “strategic partners” on the Exeter City Futures board: Devon County Council, Exeter College, University of Exeter and Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter NHS Hospital Trust.However none of Exeter City Futures’ accounts show receipt of funding from these organisations, and no account of their financial contributions, if any, has otherwise been published.In addition, Devon County Council’s representative on Exeter City Futures’ board resigned three months ago, just before the council’s plan to send its directors to work there was publicly announced, and hasn’t been replaced. (Churn at the company is nothing new: there has been a high turnover of directors since its incorporation and Karime Hassan will be its fourth MD/CEO.)The council leader acknowledged the company’s operational and financial challenges in his report, saying: “There has been a recognition from the partner organisations that something different has to happen to give momentum and confidence to the programme.”The company was awarded a £250,000 National Lottery grant, has received more than £1 million in central government funding and the council has already spent more than £350,000 on its activities. It will cost it another £116,785 to pay its director’s salaries while they work there during 2022.But instead of querying its viability or why it is not recruiting its own staff, the report concludes that “it is easier to redirect the [company] and to give it momentum than to start again”.Exeter City Council report on Exeter City Futures secondmentsThe premise on which the council leader’s recommendations rest actually seems to be that the complex networks of multifaceted relationships that make up Exeter’s social and economic fabric can be instrumentally influenced by a single node, namely Exeter City Futures.If true, it would follow that the only position from which the council’s chief executive could facilitate city decarbonisation is as the company’s CEO.Apart from the reductive oversimplification that this entails, it also implies that the council has so far been unable to realise its decarbonisation agenda because it is unable to play a city-wide facilitation role while its chief executive works in-house.However the council already does just that with a much wider range of stakeholders than sit on the Exeter City Futures board.Its chief executive justified the creation of Liveable Exeter Place Board on precisely these grounds. And the place board is just one of seven strategic collaboration mechanisms the council lists in its authority monitoring report, while it sends councillors as representatives to no fewer than 43 outside bodies.The council also has governance-level representation at Exeter College, Devon Climate Emergency Response Group, Devon and Torbay One Public Estate Board, Devon Place Board, the Heart of the South West Joint Committee and the Local Enterprise Partnership (overseeing the Local Industrial Strategy), and it owns and controls Exeter City Group, Exeter City Living and Exeter Canal and Quay Trust while having significant influence over Exeter Science Park and Monkerton Heat Company.The activities of all these organisations, as well as others in which the council has interests, are all directly relevant to Exeter’s response to the climate crisis.What the council leader’s report does do, however, is obliquely refer to the true focus of the staff secondment: Exeter Development Fund. It says: “In the original report on Net Zero Exeter the chief executive sought, and was given, authority to begin exploring opportunities to bring investment to support the city in this ambitious programme. This remains the task but requires a wider remit beyond the city council.”This emphasis was echoed in the council’s promotion of the secondment proposals. Referring to the cost of decarbonisation, the council leader said: “The money needs to be found in private and institutional investors.”Exeter Development Fund investment outline. Image: Exeter City Futures.To the extent that it addresses the risks associated with the secondments, the council leader’s report correctly identifies the potential “impact on the city council in losing the capacity of two key members of the Strategic Management Board for significant periods of time while they head up this programme of work.”However it fails to adequately explain how this impact will be mitigated, instead simply allocating some of the chief executive’s responsibilities to his deputy and adjusting management reporting lines.It doesn’t, for example, explain whether the deputy CEO’s capacity to fulfil her existing responsibilities will be compromised by the additional workload, whether she will take over the chief executive’s statutory role as Head of Paid Service, or whether the changes will have an impact on council service delivery.The remaining risks the report outlines are all related to operational viability. None are adequately addressed either.While the council leader’s report acknowledges that “a wide range of options” exist other than those it proposes, it considers only what it calls “the obvious two”: to focus primarily on the council’s own carbon emissions as “there is no statutory obligation to lead a city wide net zero agenda” or to fund a temporary secondment “to lead the programme under Exeter City Futures” which it says “was tried in the past and made progress but clearly has not proven to be the complete answer”.The council is not, of course, obliged to lead Exeter’s decarbonisation, although it did decide to do so in July 2019. And it’s not clear why Exeter City Council paying Exeter City Futures’ staffing costs now will yield better results than it did last time.  The decarbonisation agenda “would be much better served if this work was carried out within the council rather than in a stand-alone, secretive, company that we don’t have access to”.  Conservative councillor Andrew LeadbetterThe existing Net Zero Exeter plan lacks basic carbon accounting mechanisms, including baseline emissions measurements which include (and distinguish between) all three scopes, annual reduction targets necessary to meet defined decarbonisation goals and reporting mechanisms to measure progress against those reductions, which is partly why it fails to address around a million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions for which the city is responsible.But this is not because Exeter City Futures was unaware that this approach was necessary. It was originally commissioned by the council to conduct a full audit of the city’s carbon emissions and assemble an expert team to produce a delivery framework but only later admitted that it did not have the “resource capacity” to follow through.The plan’s resulting shortcomings are a reminder that procurement processes which consider alternative approaches and draw on authoritative expertise for assessment often produce better results. Simply rubber-stamping a document which has been prepared under wraps then seeking to impose it as policy is surely no-one’s idea of how to facilitate social change of the magnitude necessary to deal with the climate crisis.Proper processes are also required by the legislation under which local government operates.The council’s account of the secondment proposals nevertheless failed to supply a value for money assessment of their impact, the Section 151 Officer did not set out their financial implications or outline secondment terms including legal agreements, performance indicators and review criteria, and the Monitoring Officer said the report “raises no issues” (other than changes to Strata committee representation arrangements).Exeter City Council Executive meeting discussion of Exeter City Futures secondmentsThe recent Report in the Public Interest concerning Croydon Council’s “serious corporate and governance failings” over its failed Brick by Brick development company should give Exeter city councillors and officers pause for thought. (Croydon is on the lengthening list of local authorities which have found themselves unable to deliver their commercialisation programmes without putting their finances in jeopardy.)They include “a lack of an assessment of the real or perceived conflicts of interest” entailed by the same person simultaneously playing four related roles around a redevelopment which cost more than double its £30 million budget.Exeter City Council’s chief executive, even before becoming CEO of Exeter City Futures, of which he was already a director and whose board he chaired, had begun to elide his multiple roles at the November Executive meeting that considered his secondment. During a discussion of retrofitting he said:“The retrofit issue is an interesting one, because that’s exactly what Exeter City Futures will do. So, wearing another hat of mine, what we will be doing, is looking at vehicles for how we will deliver retrofit to the non-council housing stock and we will be exploring how we may do that.“We haven’t taken a decision on a retrofit company simply because, at the moment, our housing HRA is delivering the standards, probably more efficiently and more cheaply than the private sector is doing, and therefore we don’t need to do that.“But what we need to do, I think, is learn from Housing Revenue Account in terms of the efficiency of delivering at a level which is, I think, an exemplar for what we can do in the private stock.”When he says “we”, who does he mean?Phil Bialyk, Tony Rowe of Exeter Rugby Club, Karime Hassan and Paul Thomas of Marriott International at the Sandy Park hotel development site (right to left). The city council contributed £1 million to a £2.7 million redevelopment of the A379 junction alongside the site. Photo: Exeter City Council.The council’s decision to send two of its directors to work for a private company should have been based on more rigorous analysis.Apart from the distinction between issues raised by their secondment and wider issues around decarbonisation, the council leader’s report did not explain how the council would oversee, scrutinise or hold Exeter City Futures to account, or whether Exeter City Futures would itself begin to operate at the levels of transparency and public accountability commensurate with local authority partnership.Conflict of interest and risk management and mitigation (especially regarding financial liabilities), decision-making mechanisms and legal frameworks for relationships with partner organisations (and other stakeholders) should all have been addressed in detail.Nor should Net Zero Exeter plan delivery have been conflated with promotion of Exeter Development Fund.The plan to gamble Exeter’s future on a property development financing scheme which has never been tried before entails very significant risks, both to the council’s finances and the city’s prospects. Its focus is not the many unaddressed issues which make decarbonisation so difficult.Basic questions remain unanswered, such as how a decarbonisation strategy for Exeter can reconcile the structural changes that are needed with the statutory responsibilities (and accompanying constraints) which determine the scope within which relevant authorities (many of which are not members of Exeter City Futures) can act. Then there’s the rest of civil society, citizens and all. The current Net Zero Exeter plan offers no system-wide theory of change.And while this is not surprising, as many policy-makers around the country are only now realising that our existing governance arrangements are unfit to tackle the climate crisis, it does not mean Exeter decarbonisation plan-makers can ignore such questions. If they are left unaddressed, the plan will fail.There should nevertheless be no doubt that a financing scheme driven by central government interest in exposing public sector property assets to private capital will not provide the answers. To think that it could is to misunderstand the transformation of society that decarbonisation entails and to misconceive the means of enabling it.The council leader’s report should have made clear that Exeter Development Fund is Exeter City Futures’ primary strategic project, on which it has been working since 2017, and for which it has received the lion’s share of its funding. Not from local organisations but from central government.The report should also have accounted for the amount of time each of the council’s directors is expected to spend on city decarbonisation, rather than the development fund, when they are working under Exeter City Futures’ roof.  “Exeter City Futures is not proving to be transparent and it is not democratically accountable.”  Conservative councillor Anne JobsonGreen Party councillor Diana Moore sought to address many of these issues at the November Executive meeting, where she asked questions about missing secondment assessment criteria and the impact on council finances and services.She also asked about due diligence regarding Exeter City Futures’ competency, capacity, financial viability and funding sources, governance and staffing arrangements and conflicts of interest.She asked whether the council’s directors would focus on Exeter Development Fund when working for Exeter City Futures, and called for independent assessment of the council’s exposure to risk related to the fund as it is expected to shoulder a significant share of the required £200 million initial investment.She also queried whether councillors should decide the proposed staff secondments before being fully apprised of the fund’s nature and risks.Labour councillor Rachel Sutton responded: “These are things that can be and will be dealt with. Risk assessments and conflicts of interest and secondment are all the kinds of things that major organisations are involved in all the time.”She said that what she described as “a knock-on effect” from the proposals had been “taken into consideration” and was “actually backed up with proper research”, adding: “I’m quite certain that if you talk with officer colleagues they will be able to give you that reassurance.”She did not explain why requisite risk, governance and conflict of interest assessments had not been carried out in advance or even outlined in prospect in the report.Labour leader Phil Bialyk added: “All decisions that impact on Exeter City Council that come under our auspices, and that we are responsible for, will be reported to the Executive committee. They can be scrutinised by the scrutiny programme board. If they want to scrutinise it they can do, they have every right to. I don’t interfere with that process, they can tell us what they want to do.”The council’s scrutiny programme board, which does not meet in public or report its proceedings, is comprised of five councillors. The majority Labour group hold a majority of the board seats including the chair.Labour councillor Rachel Sutton comments on Exeter City Futures secondmentsCouncillors from all opposition parties then sought to overturn the Executive’s decision at a December meeting of the full council that was held just eleven working days before the secondments were due to start.The Conservative group proposed that the city council take responsibility for Exeter decarbonisation instead of Exeter City Futures, with the chief executive to remain in-house to work on its delivery and regular progress reviews (including target updates) to be reported to public scrutiny committees. It also proposed the inclusion of the Net Zero Exeter plan in the council’s corporate risk register.Conservative leader Andrew Leadbetter said the decarbonisation agenda “would be much better served if this work was carried out within the council rather than in a stand-alone, secretive, company that we don’t have access to” so “it would be open to proper scrutiny from members of the council”.He added: “You need to explain why we can’t have that transparency, why scrutiny is not examining it, why we wouldn’t be setting key milestones and key targets, and why it has to be put out to a third party organisation.”Conservative councillor Anne Jobson said: “Exeter City Futures is not proving to be transparent and it is not democratically accountable. In 2019 it received £200,000 from central government, and a further sum of £840,000 was received from central government in 2020.“The latter concerns the proposal for Exeter Development Fund, which sets out, in its Expression of Interest for that bid, that it was to do with housing and planning on nine identified major brownfield sites and the delivery of 12,000 homes on those sites. Those are all matters that fall to this council to determine, not to a public limited company. Housing being built is a planning matter which should be dealt with by this council.”She added: “Neither grant is referred to in the accounts published on the Companies House website. Has the 2020-21 money been spent? What has been achieved with this money? How is next year’s money to be spent? What will be achieved with the money? There simply is no accountability.“The last meeting [of the Exeter City Futures board] was held on 24 November 2020: over a year ago. There are no published minutes after that date. The minutes do not provide accountability for the voters of Exeter. They are nothing more than a record of decisions made. There is no scope for those decisions to be challenged.”Despite unanimous opposition, the Conservative group proposals were rejected by the ruling Labour group. The city council’s official record of Anne Jobson’s speech omitted all mention of Exeter Development Fund and everything she said about property development.Exeter City Council discussion of Exeter City Futures secondmentsThe Progressive group of Independent, Green Party and Liberal Democrat councillors then attempted to refer the decision for further scrutiny to consider its implications more fully.Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell said: “The [November] Executive meeting highlighted many of our concerns: risk assessments, governance and conflict of interests, but with no clarity that these have been explored or that mitigation factors are in place.“The report on which this recommendation is based has not come from an externally appointed body. We have not conducted a review of our senior management team and found some have time on their hands.”The issues surrounding this policy have not been sufficiently critically examined. If this proposal goes through this evening unamended we feel that we will be doing a disservice to the citizens of Exeter.”The Progressive group proposals were also rejected by the ruling Labour group.  “The issues surrounding this policy have not been sufficiently critically examined. If this proposal goes through this evening unamended we feel that we will be doing a disservice to the citizens of Exeter.”  Liberal Democrat councillor Michael MitchellThe December meeting then turned to discussion of Labour’s unchanged proposals. Diana Moore said none of her questions concerning risk, oversight, finances, funding or governance had been adequately addressed.She said: “As Exeter grows it is fundamental that there is clarity and transparency over the roles and relationships between citizens, the council, developers and potential investors. Citizens need to be taken with us, to understand what is happening and why.”“I agree with the fundamental proposition that is set out in the report that the council should be working with other institutions to bring greater resources to shared goals, to achieve net zero, that they wouldn’t be able to do by themselves.“But other councils are using their leadership role, their powers and status as the council, to work with partner organisations and communities to ensure transparent and inclusive action on the climate emergency. Not least so that residents can see, understand and be active participants in the urgent changes that we need to see.”“So I’d be grateful if the leader would answer this one question: why are we outsourcing our leadership, our responsibilities, our relationships and powers that we do have, as a council, to a private company?”  “Why are we outsourcing our leadership, our responsibilities, our relationships and powers that we do have, as a council, to a private company?”  Green Party councillor Diana MoorePhil Bialyk denied that the city council was outsourcing anything, saying: “We are not devolving our responsibilities, our influence, our power, to somebody else.”Referring to the need to bring the city’s principal organisations together to address the climate crisis, he said: “Leadership is about collaborating and listening, and we’ve been listening and we are collaborating with those organisations”. He added: “We need to get them together, round the table, and we’re slowly but surely doing that.”He nevertheless also said: “Using Exeter City Futures and asking the chief executive to spend up to two days of his time, and to allocate another director for three days to be working on specific designs within that, is the best way forward.”Labour councillor Duncan Wood then rehearsed the same contradiction, citing the council’s convening power in support of its chief executive working elsewhere.He said: “What we can do is mediate, what we can do is bring people together, and for that we need to be seen as a trusted friend, as somebody that can facilitate effectively, and that is what this proposal is about.“It’s about putting somebody into the seat that can actually steer people, bring people together, help people to work together. What we can give to make this happen is the skills and the trusted leadership to bring together as many partners as we can.”Nothing was said that supported the idea that Exeter will only collaborate around decarbonisation if the council’s chief executive, and a second council director, both work for Exeter City Futures.Karime Hassan, who had led the discussion of his secondment at the November Executive meeting, speaking for eleven of the 33 minutes spent on the issue, left the room this time.Local Government Association report on Exeter City CouncilNotwithstanding the way it was made, perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this decision is that the Local Government Association had already concluded that Karime Hassan’s twin posts as chief executive and growth director at Exeter City Council should be separated into two because of the difficulties of fulfilling both at the same time.Its December 2017 assessment of Exeter City Council’s “leadership, governance, corporate capacity and financial resilience” said the “focus of attention for the chief executive will, by necessity, change in coming years from outward looking growth to major internal transformation programmes. These will require the post holder to give these programmes leadership and personal involvement.”It added: “Now is the time to separate the two posts with the Chief Executive to continue with a strategic role on growth and partnership working but balanced to devote more time to leading and driving internal change.”It also raised governance concerns around Exeter City Futures, in the context of the development fund, on which work had then begun. It said: “The council is proposing that Exeter City Futures be mainstreamed into the council during 2018 to lead on city-wide transformation.“However, in doing this it will be important that the council defines Exeter City Futures’ role and how it will be integrated within the organisation.”    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.

We asked the council what happened. A member of its management team said: “I was very much involved in the corporate peer challenge process at the time but for some reason, which I cannot recall, there was no follow-up report to Executive or Council.”We also asked whether another Local Government Association assessment would take place this year, on the usual five year cycle, and were told: “At present there are no plans for another peer challenge, but I anticipate discussions will be had with the Local Government Association in 2022.”Should such an assessment take place, as the council’s chief executive has also since been appointed to work at the University of Exeter Business School, we look forward to its findings with interest."

"content" : "A development of up to 80 residential dwellings on a ten acre greenfield site alongside Exwick Lane has been given the go ahead at appeal.The city council refused the development in May last year on the grounds it would have a harmful visual impact on the Redhills ridgeline.The planning inspector rejected the council’s decision, concluding that the development would comply with the council’s planning policies. He said his judgement was not affected by the argument that it might provide a precedent for ridgeline development in other parts of Exeter.This did not deter the council leader, Phil Bialyk, from insisting that “Exeter protects the vital green ridge surrounding the city” in his budget speech on Tuesday."

"content" : "Individual overseas ownership of property in Exeter has risen by more than 350% over the past decade, with the number of titles registered in Jersey increasing nearly tenfold.There has also been a significant increase in overseas ownership of Exeter property by individuals registered in Hong Kong and Singapore.The rate of increase in Exeter is 25% greater than that across England and Wales during the period, and is greater than in areas of London where offshore ownership is concentrated, such as Kensington &amp;amp; Chelsea and Westminster, which has the highest number of properties owned by overseas individuals in the country.The most recent available data, for August 2021, shows 442 Exeter property titles owned by individuals overseas. A slight fall from the previous year may be a consequence of the introduction of new rates of stamp duty for non-residents in April 2021.In the same year a total of 492 new dwellings were built in Exeter, but this figure includes purpose built student accommodation. Excluding student and other communal accommodation, Exeter’s housing completions in 2020-21 amounted to 348 dwellings.Overseas company ownership of property in Exeter has also increased, though not as dramatically as individual overseas ownership, rising by 175% over the fifteen years to January 2021.This is nevertheless a much greater rate of increase than across England and Wales during the period, where the level of overseas company property ownership has remained essentially unchanged.Jersey again dominates the Exeter data, with more than half of all overseas company-owned titles registered there. Guernsey and the Isle of Man, both also British Crown Dependencies, and the British Virgin Islands, a British Overseas Territory, also figure prominently. All four are considered to be tax havens.Student accommodation represents a significant proportion of overseas company owned Exeter property, in the form of both purpose built student accommodation blocks and student-occupied residential property.At least ten Exeter student blocks are owned this way, and a single company owns 53 residential addresses in EX1 and EX4 alone.As property titles may refer to houses, commercial property or land, a single purpose built student accommodation block title can represent hundreds of student bedrooms in cluster flats and/or studio flats.Overseas property ownership is associated with increased house prices and reduced rates of home ownership, factors which contribute to the poor housing affordability which afflicts Exeter.The Centre for Public Data used Land Registry freedom of information requests to identify property owned by individuals and companies based overseas, extending published data on property registered to overseas companies to create a much more complete picture of the scale and significance of overseas property ownership than has been previously available.It found that 247,016 property titles in England and Wales are registered to individuals with an overseas correspondence address.This represents nearly 1% of all property titles, a proportion that has more than doubled since January 2010, and is more than two and a half times the 94,712 titles now registered to overseas companies.Overseas individuals and companies combined now own about 1 in every 75 property title in England and Wales, with a similar situation in Scotland.

"content" : "Exeter’s decarbonisation plans have been found wanting in the first national ranking of council climate action plans.The city’s plans scored 61% in an evaluation of all the UK’s local authority areas, placing it 17 points behind East Devon which was among the highest scoring districts in the country.West Devon (72%), Plymouth (67%), South Hams (66%) and Torridge (62%) were all also placed higher than Exeter in the rankings, which assessed the city’s plans on the basis of the interim Devon Carbon Plan and Net Zero Exeter plan in combination.North Devon Council did not receive a score, being one of 84 UK local authorities yet to adopt its own climate action plan.A team of 120 volunteers organised by Climate Emergency UK, a non-profit co-operative which advises local authorities on best practice approaches to decarbonisation, spent six months analysing all 325 council climate action plans that had been published by September last year.The plans were scored against 73 criteria derived from the Climate Action Plan checklist, a comprehensive guide for local authority climate action plan development which is published by Climate Emergency UK.The checklist has been developed in partnership with Friends of the Earth, the Centre for Alternative Technology, Ashden and the Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE), and has been subjected to detailed scrutiny by hundreds of councillors, council staff and other experts in successive consultations.Each local authority was sent details of its scores against the checklist criteria last October and invited to comment and correct any inaccuracies: neither Exeter City Council nor Devon County Council were among the almost 50% of councils who responded.All the scores were then audited by a smaller team of 25 before the final action plan rankings were collated.  Council climate action plan assessment sections  1. Governance, development and funding covers council commitment to climate action plans, who will lead them, and how they will be costed, funded, monitored, reviewed and updated.  2. Mitigation and adaptation considers how well action plans outline the implications of climate change for the council area and whether they set out strategies for decarbonising and adapting in key areas including:      planning and land use    transport    infrastructure    business and industry    energy generation    heating    natural environment and biodiversity    food systems and agriculture.    3. Commitment and integration assesses the integration of the climate and ecological emergency into existing council policies and procedures as well as target dates set out in action plans.  4. Community engagement and communications questions who has been involved in action plan development and how the council intends to integrate the community in delivery.  5. Measuring and setting emissions targets concentrates on emissions and other targets set out in action plans. Is there a baseline emissions inventory? Are emissions broken down into scopes 1, 2 and 3? Are greenhouse gas emissions quantified? Do plans prioritise emissions reductions over carbon offsetting?  6. Co-benefits asks whether action plans consider the co-benefits of climate action and the public health risks of climate change.  7. Diversity and social inclusion centres on whether action plans outline which sections of the population will be most harmed by climate change, how resources will be focussed on supporting vulnerable communities and whether differing council and resident responsibilities for climate action are recognised.  8. Education, skills and training focuses on carbon literacy training for all staff and councillors as well as public education and workforce skills development.  9. Ecological emergency looks at action plan commitments to tackling the ecological emergency. Do plans focus on nature-based solutions? Are the ecological impacts of climate change mitigation action considered?Combining assessment of the Net Zero Exeter plan with the interim Devon Carbon Plan meant Exeter scored higher than it would otherwise have done had the city’s net zero plan been considered alone, particularly in key areas including goal definition, monitoring, evaluation, stakeholder involvement and communications.At the same time misrepresentations contained in the Net Zero Exeter plan also inflated the city’s score, such as the false claim that “Exeter City Council has already committed to becoming a carbon-neutral council by 2022”.However Climate Emergency UK intends to examine what are often wide gaps between council decarbonisation plans and real-world action in the next phase of its research into local authority responses to the climate crisis.Having established a policy baseline with the Climate Action Plan Explorer, an open database of UK council climate action plans, and now the publication of its council climate scorecards, it will begin to assess the extent to which local authorities are on track to meet the greenhouse gas emissions targets they have set later this year.Annie Pickering of Climate Emergency UK said: “A good action plan has the basics covered. This means that the actions are specific and measurable and assigned to teams or departments. It should also be clear how the plan will be monitored as it is implemented.“This year’s scorecards are just the start of the process. It has been an important exercise to understand what makes a good council climate action plan and we hope that it will help councils learn from each other and up their game.“While we understand that councils need much more support and funding from the national government, and have been stretched by responding to the pandemic, the fact that some councils have developed well thought out, costed and ambitious plans, shows that it is possible.”    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.

It is currently on track to be carbon neutral by 2028.But Exeter’s near neighbour Somerset West and Taunton leads the way in climate action planning, scoring 92% in Climate Emergency UK’s rankings, the best result of any UK local authority.Its Carbon Neutrality and Climate Resilience Action Plan is a policy-making object lesson for other local authorities, as is its introduction of interim “climate positive” planning policy despite, like Exeter, having already begun a new local plan development process."

It wasn’t Exeter City Council.MUST TRY HARDERThe university recently let us know that its carbon emissions were down 19% during the 2020-21 academic year, although as the reductions came mostly from travel that didn’t take place because of the COVID-19 pandemic we look forward to seeing how it will frame what will presumably therefore be an emissions increase next year.Meanwhile the 2021 People &amp;amp; Planet university rankings placed the university in 16th position nationally for its ethical and environmental performance. Not too shabby, but not quite the table-topping performance promised by the university’s Green Futures PR.MONEY FOR NOTHINGThe Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) closed its consultation on draft changes to the Prudential Code last month, following a preliminary consultation earlier this year. The code governs how much councils can borrow to invest and what forms of commercial activity they are permitted to pursue.The Local Government Association’s response to the changes reflected “concern” among some local authorities that their borrowing-based spending power might be curtailed. However it appears that two thirds of consultation respondents supported the proposed new wording without amendment.No wonder Exeter City Council recently rushed through a decision, taken in private, to create a £55 million property purchase budget without giving the legally-required notice.DEVOLUTION DOUBLESPEAK?Devon is apparently at the front of the pack for a Michael Gove-flavoured “double” devolution deal despite a competing bid led by Plymouth City Council (which wants to combine with the adjacent West Devon and South Hams district councils), next to no guidance on what is on offer from Whitehall, and even less public discussion about the prospect of local government changes across the county.With options being discussed including the replacement of the two tier district/county authority system with a single tier and a directly elected Mayor, it’s about time County Hall came clean about its plans. DLUHC’s “Levelling Up” white paper, postponed until January, is expected to announced Devon is in the first wave of deals.For those being kept in the dark, which is most of us, the Institute for Government has published a useful county devolution deals explainer as well as a report examining the issues. PDF here.DEMOCRACY INACTIONMeanwhile the poor record of the county council-led Devon Climate Emergency Response Group on keeping the public informed about what it is up to reached a new low this month, when it simultaneously published the minutes of ten meetings on the same day, some from as long ago as August.Despite being almost entirely comprised of the representatives of public bodies, and being led by a top tier local authority, Devon Climate Emergency Response Group does not publish its agendas in advance and holds its meetings in private.Its minutes, which it would be charitable to describe as minimal, refer only indirectly to major issues, thus keeping decisions such as the date that has been set for Devon decarbonisation from the public. And it has now decided to scrap the planned public consultation on the draft Devon Carbon Plan altogether.KEEP IT IN THE FAMILYEarlier this year the University of Exeter drew attention to the South West’s significant social mobility issues, which it described as “blighting young lives”, when it launched a research project hoping to better understand the region’s challenges.The South West, which includes pockets of significant rural and urban disadvantage, has some of the largest attainment gaps in the country at the end of primary school, as well as the lowest rate of higher education access for disadvantaged children.The project lead, Lee Elliot Major, holds one of two university seats on Liveable Exeter Place Board, an unelected de facto decision-making and local governance body that meets in private, does not publish its discussions or decisions and exercises public functions with the potential to affect everyone who lives and works in Exeter.He sits alongside Lisa Roberts, current university Vice-Chancellor and CEO, while Steve Smith, former university Vice-Chancellor chairs the board. Steve Smith also chairs the social mobility research project advisory board, presumably following the “key role” he played in a “high profile advisory group aimed at improving social mobility within the higher education sector” that Universities UK convened back in 2016.

ON THE AGENDATORCH SONGPlans to rebuild the burnt out Royal Clarence hotel as luxury apartments with a restaurant and bar on the ground floor are being shopped by the scheme’s developers, who are inviting feedback until 22 December before submitting an application for planning permission early next year.As discussions with the city council have been going on behind the scenes for more than a year, the scope for public consultation at this stage must be limited. That’s what the developers are calling it, nevertheless.FIDDLING IN THE MARGINSDevon County Council is inviting responses to its plans to widen pavements and install zebra crossings in Alphington which it says will help mitigate the impact of traffic from the planned South West Exeter development. The development will include 2,500 new homes, a school for 1400 pupils, shops and a 60 acre business park.As Exeter Cycling Campaign politely puts it: “We fear their proposals lack ambition and won’t deliver on these stated aims.” The deadline for responses is 31 January.ON OUR READING LISTA fascinating research project led by Jean-Francois Mercure, Associate Professor in Climate Policy at the University of Exeter and a research fellow at the University of Cambridge, has priced the risks associated not only with the carbon embedded in traditional capital assets over their expected lifespans, but also with the disruption to human resources that become more likely the longer the transition to a low carbon economy is postponed.It found that a significant proportion of total investment is tied up in things that provide returns over decades, including people, and that carbon reduction policies could require near-complete scrapping of all long-lived carbon intensive capital in the economy over the next 30 years.One arresting conclusion: for the UK to reach net zero by 2050, nearly £11 trillion in planned returns on investment (equivalent to 35% of the size of the UK economy) may need to be written off before then. And that’s if comprehensive action begins next year. With every year’s delay, the bill balloons.

"content" : "Exeter City Council first recognised the now familiar consequences of the university’s expansion fifteen years ago, when it responded to the university’s new estates strategy. This made clear that recently-installed Vice Chancellor Steve Smith had big ideas about the future growth of student numbers in Exeter.The council strategy referred to “the impact on the local community of students living off-campus, particularly in areas close by where many students choose to live” and recognised that “students raise issues of car parking, anti social behaviour, increased rent levels and effects on local demography”.It also set the template for the council’s subsequent policy-making non sequiturs, which began with the assumption “that the private sector will provide space equivalent to about 25% of the growth” despite also admitting that this assumption “appears challenging since the sector accommodates about 50% of existing students”.Fast forward to November this year, and the hearing given to a petition presented by Pennsylvania residents aimed at protecting them from the encroachment of landlords snapping up the remaining residential housing in their area to turn it into shared student housing.The city council’s initial response to the petition was to propose to do nothing, at least until the new local plan had been adopted, following its form on previously-promised policies on low carbon construction and co-living which have also been postponed for at least several more years.Then, perhaps recognising the ire that council officers’ intransigence was causing, the council’s Executive committee first deferred the decision until the end of the month then amended the proposal to task officers with the preparation of another report, delivery date unspecified, on whether the council might address the Pennsylvania petitioners’ concerns after all.However the issues raised by their petition, the latest in more than a decade of similar responses by Exeter residents to the impact of university expansion, run much deeper than the limited scope of the review that may be on offer when officers report back to Executive members.In this special report, we examine the growth of university student numbers and its impact on residential housing in the city alongside Exeter City Council’s flawed attempts to use planning policy to mitigate that impact.We find that while the number of students has soared, the council’s policies have failed to prevent mass student occupation of residential housing stock, despite the proliferation of Purpose Built Student Accommodation, and now co-living, across the city.We also find that the council’s responses to the Pennsylvania petitioners are the latest in a long line of officer reports to councillors which rely on faulty premises, inaccurate information and miscalculated projections and which have repeatedly misrepresented the situation but nevertheless provided the basis on which student accommodation policy has been made.Pennsylvania housing stock in Sylvan RoadUniversity of Exeter student numbers have been at the centre of city council student accommodation policy-making since November 2006, when the council produced the first of many reports on the impact of university expansion on the city.The council’s first subsequent related planning policy, made a few months later, “supported the intention of the university to expand” without grappling with those numbers. A public consultation followed, which produced another policy in February 2008 which did, instead, lead with the numbers.Unfortunately, those numbers were based on the first of several faulty assumptions made by the council about student accommodation which have bedevilled its policy-making ever since.Referring back to its 2006 reports, the council said that around 17% of the university’s then students were “assumed to live at home in Exeter or nearby”. However figures that were published more recently by the Higher Education Statistic Agency (HESA) and the university itself show that only around 6% of Exeter students live at home.The council also accepted the university’s student growth projections, which in 2008 were that it expected to have around 12,000 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) students in Exeter by the following academic year, rising to 15,000 by 2015-16. (FTE student numbers are intended to combine full-time and part-time students into a single total used for planning educational provision, while total numbers of students should be used to plan for student accommodation.)However, the university actually had more than 13,000 FTE students by 2008-9 and grew to have nearly 17,500 by 2015-16.Perhaps the university deliberately downplayed its expectations. It certainly didn’t welcome the prospect of restrictions on its expansion. A  council report on its draft 2008 planning policy guidance included a telling description of the university’s response:“By adding additional constraints, the guidance runs the risk of being ‘part of the problem’ rather then a positive planning measure. The university regard[s] the focus on achieving a ‘mixed community throughout the year’ as a questionable planning objective. […] Accordingly the university suggests that the draft SPG is not adopted.”Polsloe housing stock in Monks RoadThe following year the city council introduced another unsubstantiated assumption into its student accommodation impact assessments which further distorted the figures. It added part-time students, most of whom live at home and are members of the wider community, to the full-time students it said also lived at home, discounting both groups from the numbers that require term-time accommodation.However, HESA figures show that most of the 7% of the university’s students who attend part-time coincide with the 6% who live at home, as would be expected.The city council has nevertheless since typically derived its figures for the number of students that need term-time accommodation, as the basis for its student accommodation policy-making, by starting with FTE numbers then subtracting both part-time students (instead of recognising that the true number of students is greater than the FTE figure) and full-time students (who it says also live at home).This consistently produces figures that are significantly lower than the true number of students who live away from home in Exeter during term-time.And despite ready access to relevant HESA and university data, and being corrected by an independent academic report it commissioned to examine Exeter’s student accommodation issues in 2018 (which it has not published), the city council has not changed its approach.For example, earlier this year a report (which it also has not published) to Planning Member Working Group (which is comprised of members of the council’s planning committee who meet in private to discuss planning policy issues) said that 21,760 students had needed term-time accommodation in Exeter during the 2019-20 academic year. Council officers had calculated this figure by starting with 22,360 Exeter FTE students then subtracting a total of 1,568 part-time and live-at-home students.However HESA confirms that there were actually 24,357 university students in Exeter that year, of whom around 22,895 needed term-time accommodation, 1100 more than the council said.The difference is the equivalent of around 300 typical Exeter shared student houses. That’s three times as many houses as there are in Victoria Street, which stretches from Union Road to the railway cutting that runs through the heart of St James.St James housing stock in Victoria StreetPerhaps it’s not surprising that city council officers have got these numbers wrong so often: the university itself frequently misquotes information on student numbers in its own annual reports and financial statements.The university can also be remarkably coy about historic student numbers: it refuses freedom of information requests for this data on the grounds it is commercially sensitive, instead referring requesters to a private sector data platform which typically charges £1,500 + VAT for such information.Nevertheless, the consistency with which the council has underestimated student numbers growth is still striking. In 2006 it projected 14,965 Exeter FTE students by 2015-16. The true figure was 17,399. In 2009 it increased this projection by only 1,000 despite Exeter student numbers rising by more than 4,000 in the three years following the 2006 strategy.Then in 2016 it made an even more egregious error in a report to Planning Member Working Group (which it has not published). It presented the number of Exeter FTEs as 18,038 that year when the true number was already 19,772 — and projected an increase to 18,600 three years later despite that number already being exceeded. The true 2019-20 number was 22,685.Amazingly, officers again repeated this mistake in the council’s 2019 report  (which has also not been published). It claimed 21,956 Exeter FTEs that year when the true number was already 22,685 and projected 22,879 for the following year, by which time the true number had already leapt to 24,586.City council planning policies contain similar errors. The 2010 Streatham campus masterplan, which is still in force and is supposed to guide development to 2026, was based on the projection that there would be 15,800 FTE students on the campus by 2025-26. There were already nearly 1,500 more than this  by 2016, nine years earlier than that. And Councillor Rachel Sutton, in the preface, said there were 10,700 FTE students enrolled at Streatham at the time, when there were 11,500.The 2012 Exeter Core Strategy, which is the city’s principal planning policy document, is similarly based on a projection that the number of full-time students living away from home in Exeter would be just 16,229 by 2025-26. This is despite a Planning Member Working Group report from the same year concluding that “overall the university will increase from about 16,000 students in 2011 to about 20,000 in 2018”. The true number passed 20,000 in 2015, ten years earlier, according to HESA.Then in 2014 the city council amended a 2011 Supplementary Planning Document, which also forms part of the local plan, which had projected just 18,700 Exeter FTE students by 2025-26, to create a new Supplementary Planning Document based on figures supplied by the university.These projected 18,000 Exeter FTE students by 2018-19, seven years earlier than the previous policy. The true number of Exeter FTE students by 2018-19 was 23,613.  Exeter Local Plan  Exeter City Council is the city’s planning authority. As such, it is responsible for the Exeter Local Plan, which is comprised of the Core Strategy Development Plan Document and policies which have been saved from the Exeter Local Plan First Review.  The local plan is amplified by Supplementary Planning Documents and supported by other materials including masterplans and development briefs.  A monitoring and evidence base, including the 2015 Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment supports existing and emerging planning policies.  An Exeter Development Delivery Development Plan Document has also been prepared, but not adopted.  Exeter’s current local plan includes many policies which are now more than 15 years old, and some which are more than 25 years old.In 2015, when the government removed the cap on student numbers that had previously limited each university’s intake, the city council commissioned external research on student accommodation issues in Exeter by Professor Darren Smith of Loughborough University.Professor Smith is known for coining the term “studentification” to describe the domination of residential neighbourhoods by student households and its associated social, cultural and environmental impacts. He was asked to “identify the options and implications for accommodating the future growth of students in Exeter”.His subsequent report (which has not been published) was based on the projection that the total number of University of Exeter students would be 22,570 by 2030. It is unsurprising that this number is so inaccurate, as Professor Smith relied on information provided by the city council and the university to derive it. According to HESA, this number had already been exceeded in 2018, just three years later.Professor Smith produced a follow-up report in 2018 (which has also not been published) which bizarrely concluded that the total Exeter university student population would be 22,080 by 2030 — less than the previous report. This time Professor Smith relied solely on information provided by the university.According to HESA, Exeter university student numbers have increased by 31% in the five years since 2015, nearly three and half times the rate across the UK higher education sector in the same period.  Planning Member Working Group  The city council’s Planning Member Working Group is a sub-group of members of its planning committee which meets in private to consider specific planning topics, often revisiting key issues over time.  Since 2008 (when Exeter City Council tried to strengthen Local Plan policy H5 by introducing Supplementary Planning Guidance) it has considered the impact of student accommodation on the city on an annual basis.  The city council used to publish records of Planning Member Working Group meetings, including their agendas, minutes and reports.  However it stopped doing so in 2016, and would only release redacted copies of those documents under freedom of information legislation in response to our enquiries.  Relevant Planning Member Working Group reports:      October 2008 - University of Exeter expansion proposals    June 2009 - First St James residents’ petition    August 2010 - Need for Article 4 Direction  and Exeter City Council HMO policies    July 2012 - 20% threshold too high + annual count too infrequent?    June 2013 - Public consultation on extending Article 4 Direction (Executive report)    January 2016 - 2015 research report by Professor Darren Smith (unpublished)    June 2016 - “The number of Council Tax exemptions may therefore further increase” (unpublished)    July 2018 - 2018 research update by Professor Darren Smith (unpublished)    September 2019 - “Previous growth forecasts have been underestimated” (unpublished)    June 2021 - “Around 53% of students in need of accommodation are currently housed in PBSA” (unpublished)  The catalogue of council officer student number miscalculations has continued this year. A June report to Planning Member Working Group (which the council has not published) projected 24,507 Exeter FTE students by 2024-25. Bizarrely this is lower than the figures published on the university website for 2020-21.It also projected an increase of just 183 Exeter FTE students during the following year (to 24,769 by 2025-26) despite an increase of more than 7,000 during the past five years.The council’s reports to November’s Executive committee meetings in response to the Pennsylvania residents’ petition are also riddled with misrepresentations. They both say the total number of students currently studying at the university in Exeter is 23,661, nearly a thousand less even than the 24,586 FTE figures published by the university.According to HESA, the true number of University of Exeter students has been an average of just over 6% more than the FTE figures that the university publishes over the four years from 2016. So the true number of university students in Exeter is currently likely to be in excess of 26,000. That’s nearly 2,500 more than the council says.Around 94% of Exeter’s university students need term-time accommodation, so the city is currently housing 24,500 students who do not live at home. That’s 2,700 more than the council claims in these reports.These reports also miscalculate student number projections, claiming that the number studying in the city will rise to 24,679 by 2025-26 when the university’s published figures confirm the number has already exceeded this total.If the university continues to grow during the next five years at the rate it has in the past five, more than 10,000  additional students should be expected by 2025.And any doubts about the coronavirus pandemic stunting its continued expansion should be dispelled by the fact that Exeter student numbers rose by more than 2,000 in 2020-21 compared with the previous academic year.At the very least we should expect, as Councillor Ruth Williams, who chairs the council’s Planning Member Working Group, said at last month’s planning committee meeting “another nearly 1,000 students in the next year”.  Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs)  A house in multiple occupation (HMO) is a property rented out by at least three people who are not from one household (for example a family) but share facilities like the bathroom and kitchen. It’s sometimes called a house share.  A licence is required to rent out a large HMO in England or Wales. A property is defined as a large HMO if all of the following apply:      it is rented to five or more people who form more than one household    some or all tenants share toilet, bathroom or kitchen facilities    at least one tenant pays rent (or their employer pays it for them).    Mandatory licensing of HMOs came into force in 2006 and originally applied to properties of three or more storeys with five or more people making up two or more separate households living in them.  The scope of mandatory HMO licensing was extended in October 2018 so that properties used as HMOs in England which house five or more people in two or more separate households will in many cases require a licence.  A useful House of Commons Library briefing is available on the subject.The dramatic rise in student numbers in Exeter has had, and will continue to have, a wide range of consequences. These include impacts on residential communities which range from anti-social behaviour including night-time noise, refuse overflowing into streets and term-time car parking and use. However, these issues are often the result of the actions of a minority of students. The majority are responsible and socially-minded citizens.Of greater and lasting significance is the hollowing out of residential neighbourhoods as owner-occupied and resident-rented housing is sold off to become shared student accommodation (which is much more profitable for landlords than renting to families). According to Professor Smith, an average of 3.5 students share a typical HMO, so for every thousand students who move into residential housing around 285 residential dwellings are lost.All these considerations are addressed in paragraph 53 of the National Planning Policy Framework which intends to “protect local amenity or the well-being of [an] area” and has recently been updated.As many shared student houses are HMOs, you might expect changes in the number of HMOs over time to provide a useful measure of the impact of expanding student numbers on residential housing in the city. However, only a subset of HMOs fall under the mandatory licensing scheme which makes them identifiable by city council environmental health officers, and the rest are not being properly monitored.Instead, the city council only estimates the total number of HMOs in Exeter each year, figures which it is required to compile by central government.The city council’s estimates show that the number of HMOs in Exeter has nearly doubled in the past ten years. In 2011 it estimated that there were 2510 such dwellings in the city (of which 836 were licensed) while the figure it returned to central government for 2021 is 4412.However the council has returned identical estimates to central government for the past four years running, so its 2021 estimate must viewed with scepticism. This is not least because the number of mandatory licensed HMOs in the city has risen during this period (following a change in the law in October 2018) so the number of unlicensed HMOs would have fallen were the city council’s estimates correct.As Councillor Emma Morse, who is the Executive member with responsibility for city development, admitted in June this year, the council has “limited capacity” for such monitoring.If the statistical trend in the three years until the city council’s Exeter HMO estimate became fixed at 4412 has continued, the true number of HMOs in the city is now more likely to be in excess of 6,500. This would be consistent with the rise in student numbers during the past four years.It was the then rising numbers of HMOs that prompted 350 St James’ residents to petition the council twelve years ago, saying they were “concerned about the growing number of homes in multiple occupation in the ward”. Their petition proposed that “the whole of St James ward should be declared an area of planning restraint, in order both to protect us against a further increase in the number of HMOs and to maintain a balanced community”.It not only called for a halt to all new HMOs in St James but restrictions north of Union Road too. It is residents in this part of Pennsylvania who have recently petitioned the council again.However, in 2009 planning controls could not be applied to many student HMOs as they were too small: a group of up to six people living as a single household was not treated as a material change of use from a family dwelling.This is why Exeter Local Plan policy H5, which was saved from the previous local plan in 2008, was unable to prevent the spread of HMOs. Its provisions only applied where planning consent was required:“The conversion of dwellings to flats self contained bedsitters or houses in multiple occupation and the development of special needs or student housing will be permitted provided that (b) the proposal will not create an over concentration of the use in any one area of the city which would change the character of the neighbourhood or create an imbalance in the local community.”An accompanying planning policy was intended to reinforce this emphasis by providing “guidance on interpreting Policy H5 within particular areas, so that student developments do not adversely affect the character of the neighbourhood or create an imbalance in the local community”.Then in 2010 the outgoing Labour government introduced a new planning use class which brought many more shared student houses under planning control. The subsequent coalition government then announced that it intended to retain the new use class, but would treat changes of use from family dwelling to small HMO as permitted development that would not normally require planning permission.This compelled councils which wanted to exercise planning control over conversions of residential dwellings to HMOs to make an Article Four direction removing those permitted development rights. Their removal would not prevent such conversions, but would mean planning permission would be required before they could take place.Despite government guidance which made clear that an Article 4 direction area could cover any geography up to an entire local authority area, provided there was “justification for both its purpose and extent”, the resulting Exeter City Council report said: “The area covered by an Article Four direction should have regard to areas where there is an existing problem of a concentration of HMOs that the council may wish to control and a ‘buffer zone’ of areas that have a lesser concentration and may come under pressure due to future expansion.”It also said: “It is considered that an approach based upon council tax exemptions is the most robust, evidence based, approach to identifying any area proposed to be subject to restrictions” despite offering little support for this claim other than the 2008 planning policy guidance which had itself relied on it, on anecdotal and heuristic grounds, and an untested Nottingham City Council plan to adopt a similar approach.On this basis the council proposed an Article 4 direction area which would include streets in which 20% or more of dwellings were “class N” exempt from council tax because they were entirely occupied by students. At the time this equated to about 40 streets in St James, Newtown and Polsloe. In a further six streets more than two thirds of the dwellings were class N council tax exempt.Then in December 2010 another petition, this time signed by 772 St James residents, called for Exeter City Council to “prevent any further conversions to HMOs, except in those streets where the existing high number of HMOs has already significantly harmed the family residential character and where, therefore, it may be in the resident’s or residents’ interest to allow further conversions”.It also called for the council to “provide for all future Exeter university student accommodation in purpose-built developments on the campus itself or on discrete (individually distinct or separate) sites outside St James and other established residential neighbourhoods”.Exeter Article 4 direction area August 2010 proposal map.

Other responses were that the proposed 20% class N council tax exemptions threshold for restrictions was too high, reflecting research previously cited by the council which showed that a majority considered there was a problem at a 10% threshold, and that as student HMOs often housed several people, frequently twice as many as a family dwelling, even a low threshold would equate to a significant proportion of the population in an area. Others said the 20% threshold was not only too high, but also arbitrary.Councillor Sutton, then Executive member with responsibility for sustainable development and transport, nevertheless took the decision, in conjunction with a council officer, to confirm an Article 4 direction which only restricted HMO conversions in a small core area based on 20% class N council tax exemptions (excluding nine streets with very high existing concentrations of students) and defining adjacent “buffer zones” which would be subject to potential future restriction when class N council tax exemptions reached 20%.The Article 4 direction was duly adopted on 1 January 2012, after twelve month’s notice had been given to avoid council liability for student landlord compensation claims.By May 2013 the 20% threshold had already been exceeded in most of the Article 4 “buffer zones”.  The council admitted that despite the policies it had so far put in place there had “been a significant increase in shared student houses as a result of expansion by the University of Exeter” and extended the restrictions in January 2014 to include all of the Article 4 area. It hasn’t been extended or updated since.By April 2015, 81% of Exeter class N council tax exemptions were in Article 4 direction area streets.Exeter Article 4 direction area July 2011 map. Source: Exeter City Council. Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2019.There are several reasons why class N council tax exemption figures are not “the most robust, evidence based, approach to identifying” student occupation of residential housing or a reliable “indicator of the distribution of the student population”, as the city council’s response to the recent Pennsylvania petition said.One is that the exemption figures apply to dwellings, which range from individual studio flats to multi-bedroom cluster flats with a dozen occupants or more. Another is that the lack of unlicensed HMO monitoring means the council cannot cross-refer the council tax N exemption data it does have with data on the majority of the city’s HMOs which it does not have. A third is that some HMOs are not occupied by students at all.In addition, significant numbers of students live in residential households as lodgers and others in their existing family homes and so are also not included in class N council tax exemption figures. And, as a 2015 study of Monks Road showed, a significant proportion of residential housing that has been exempt but then ceases to be so nevertheless continues to be occupied by students. In addition, student accommodation that is owned and managed by the university falls under a different (class M) council tax exemption regime.The city council acknowledged some of these limitations in 2011: “Not all students who live in private houses are in properties that are registered as exempt from council tax. There are students who lodge or share with non-students. There are also many houses in multiple occupation that are not occupied by students and small properties of one or two bedrooms that are council tax exempt that are not classified as houses in multiple occupation.”It nevertheless went on to conclude that “the figures for council tax exemptions do not show the whole picture so far as houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) are concerned, but they do provide a useful measure for gauging the growth and distribution of student occupation in private dwellings.”However recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis definitively rejects this claim. Seeking to better understand how well administrative data can be used to identify residential addresses occupied by students, and excluding halls of residence and purpose built student accommodation, the ONS distinguished between student occupation of family homes, mixed student and non-student addresses and addresses solely occupied by students.It found that only 12% of students live in addresses solely occupied by students, with around 30% living in addresses that appear to be made up of students and non-students. It also found that only half of all student addresses have any indication on council tax that students live there.To the extent that the city council’s erroneous reliance on class N council tax exemptions to set student housing policy in 2008 may be forgotten, and its subsequent reliance on them to determine the narrow scope of the Article 4 direction area may (or may not) be forgiven, it has no excuse for relying on them now.And yet, despite acknowledging that it no longer monitors the spread of HMO conversions through the city, it reasserted its reliance on them in last month’s reports, while claiming “decreases in numbers of council tax exemption N properties in the general housing stock which represent HMOs”.The other city council student housing policy that has been in place for so long that it seems to have substance despite not being based on robust evidence is its policy that 75% of additional student numbers at the university should be housed in Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA). (Additional being the increase in student numbers year on year.)This originates in the council’s 2007 University Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG), which said: “The city council, where appropriate, will impose planning conditions or seek a planning obligation to ensure that expansion in the university’s teaching, research and general facilities is accompanied by the provision of significant increases in purpose-built student residential accommodation, such that 75% or more of the additional student numbers are accommodated.”Apart from the fact that this policy predicates PBSA provision on expansion of university facilities, not student numbers, it was dreamt up by city council planning officers when the public consultation held on the draft SPG produced “a number of comments that the support for the expansion of the university is too open-ended”. No evidence was presented in its support.A clearer formulation was subsequently included in the 2012 Core Strategy, the city’s principal planning policy document. Policy CP5, which says: “The supply of housing should meet the needs of all members of the community such that […] purpose built student accommodation should be provided to meet the housing need” is clarified by paragraph 6.28, which says: “75% or more of additional student numbers should be accommodated in purpose built student housing” (and also refers to all the preceding related local planning policy).  University of Exeter-related planning policies  The city council has a range of policies regarding the University of Exeter, including planning policies:            2005 Exeter Local Plan First Review saved policies H5 - diversity of housing and E4 - Exeter university campus (saved March 2008)              June 2007 University Supplementary Planning Guidance - the origin of the 75% of growth via PBSA policy              February 2008 Student accommodation development in residential areas Supplementary Planning Guidance on interpreting Policy H5 within particular areas              December 2010 Streatham campus masterplan 2011-2026 - contains the single sentence (among a hundred pages) which Exeter City Council cited to justify describing the Clydesdale area of the campus as “a brownfield site where redevelopment is to be expected and encouraged”              February 2012 Core Strategy policy CP5 and paragraph 6.28              July 2013 St James Neighbourhood Plan              July 2015 Development Delivery Development Plan Document - policies inc. Residential Conversions and Houses in Multiple Occupation (inc. DD11) and Purpose built student accommodation (inc. DD12).      Like the unsubstantiated 20% class N council tax exemption threshold, this “75% or more of additional student numbers” formulation has afflicted the city ever since its creation. The council’s subsequent efforts to try to demonstrate that the policy is having its intended effect have led it to present some extraordinary claims to councillors.For example, a report to this year’s Planning Member Working Group (and quoted in the Pennsylvania petition reports) claimed that there had been “a cumulative increase of 11,493 university students in need of accommodation” since 2006-7 which, when measured against an increase of just over 8,100 PBSA bedspaces during the same period, meant that “71% of additional students in need of accommodation have been housed in PBSA”.However the true increase in student numbers during the period was around 3,000 higher than the city council’s calculations, which relied on erroneous assumptions about the number of part-time students and students living at home.So only 56% of the additional students were actually housed in PBSA, leaving an additional 6,300 students to find accommodation in the city’s residential housing stock. (Even the city council’s calculations would have meant an additional 3,400 students living in HMOs.)Last month’s city council Executive meeting was nevertheless told: “These two approaches [Article 4 direction and 75% PBSA policy] have been relatively successful in accommodating the additional student growth in purpose-built student accommodation.”  The march of PBSA  In 2006 there were 3,000 PBSA bedspaces on campus and around 1,000 elsewhere in the city. Since then PBSA development has accelerated, and is now considered as part of a cluster of build to rent styles which also includes “co-living”.  By July 2018, combined on- and off-campus PBSA was providing just over 7,500 bedspaces in Exeter and by January 2021 that figure had risen to just under 11,500 , an increase of 7,500 bedspaces over the fifteen years between 2006 and 2021.  During that period the number of university students in Exeter increased by more than 14,000.  The university continues to plan massive on-campus PBSA expansion and developers continue to queue up to construct enormous build to rent blocks across the city, with 133 bedspaces being built on the former South West Ambulance Service depot on Gladstone Road, 378 bedspaces planned to replace the Harlequins centre and more than 1,000 on their way on the site of the former magistrates’ court and police station on Heavitree Road.  However, PBSA delivery is showing signs of slowing. This year’s unpublished Planning Member Working Group report said: “The pipeline indicated a drop in the amount of new PBSA development over the next three years although the need for student accommodation was expected to rise. The drop could reflect shift in market focus in Exeter to co-living.”  “If the rate of provision of PBSA does decline and students do not wish to live in co-living housing in sufficient numbers […] pressure will grow for the creation of new student HMOs in the general housing stock.”Both Professor Smith’s unpublished 2015 and 2018 reports proposed that the city council should aim to reduce the number of students occupying residential housing stock to 2006 levels by 2030. This would have meant a total of less than 1,200 student HMOs in Exeter by then.Professor Smith thought achieving this aim would entail accommodating 75% of all students in PBSA, not just additional students, a strategy which he expected to produce reductions in class N council tax exemptions and the reversion of HMOs to residential housing use. (He recommended the compilation of an evidence base to demonstrate these effects.)However, not only did Professor Smith accept the university’s expansion forecasts at face value, he also (initially) accepted the city council’s assumptions about term-time accommodation rates. This led him to conclude that class N council tax exemptions would peak at 2,130 across the city’s residential housing stock. By January this year there were already more than 2,400 such exemptions, with a further 2,700 in off-campus PBSA.Despite ignoring the revised PBSA 75% policy proposal, which it described as a “more challenging” option in its resulting, unpublished report to Planning Member Working Group, the city council enthusiastically embraced other aspects of Professor Smith’s 2015 report.Another resulting, also unpublished, 2016 council report said: “If over 3,000 additional bedspaces could be delivered by 2019-20, in a period when students in need of accommodation is expected to rise by about 1,300, then it may be possible to achieve a significant fall in council tax exemptions.”It added: “If the number of council tax exemptions in private shared houses is to be reduced then the council must continue to allow significant amounts of additional PBSA to be delivered that exceed the growth rate of the university. The sites presently coming forward in the city and at Streatham should enable it to do this if planning permission is granted and they are implemented.”And Exeter was ripe for PBSA development. As Professor Smith said: “Exeter is widely perceived by commercial developers and providers of PBSA as a city that is openly willing and seeking to embrace the development of more PBSA.” He added: “The pro-PBSA policy of Exeter City Council is widely circulated within media and policy discourses” which “show that there is a clear perception that there is a buoyant market for the supply of exclusive, high-cost PBSA in Exeter.”This is the context in which the university first presented its enormous 1,200 bedspace East Park development, for which outline planning permission was granted in April 2017, less than a year later, and mooted the 1,250 bedspace redevelopment of Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village, which has since also received outline permission.The council should have been more sceptical about the university’s expansion plans: instead of Exeter student numbers increasing by 1,300 they rose by more than 5,500 during the period.The city council nevertheless did begin to question its position. Its second 2016 report acknowledged that the 75% policy “does leave the remaining 25% increasing pressures for shared student houses in popular student areas” and wondered whether “a target of 100% or more of additional students in PBSA may be more appropriate”.These concerns were repeated in another council report on the issue later that year, which also observed that “even where new market private housing is provided in popular student areas (such as Central Station Yard) it tends to be occupied by a high proportion of students”.Councillors also began to raise issues such as “the growing problem of students bringing cars to the city” and “the public perception that, from an accommodation perspective, the city seemed, in some areas and on some issues, to be overwhelmed by the student presence”.They mentioned “students directly replacing non-student tenants in private accommodation” and “concerns that available land was increasingly dedicated to PBSAs rather than new housing for the wider market” despite the latter “also often [being] occupied by students”. And at least one councillor realised that “the council had conflicting goals and money generated distorted the market development in favour of students”.By 2019 the city council had begun to realise that its policies were ill-conceived. An unpublished report to Planning Member Working Group admitted that another assumption it had previously relied on for its growth forecasts, which it now realised were underestimates, was wrong. Instead of the long-term average annual increase in student numbers who needed term-time accommodation hovering around 250, the true number was more like 770.It also admitted that fluctuating PBSA delivery meant that pressure on the city’s residential housing stock continued to increase despite the planned PBSA pipeline, and that “very little correlation between the annual increase in student numbers and PBSA provision” meant inevitable increases in demand for shared student HMOs in years in which low levels of PBSA provision combined with large increases in student numbers.The comments of an absent councillor, submitted in writing, were nevertheless ignored: “Council planning policy should be amended without further delay to exclude these wards [Duryard &amp;amp; St James, St David’s and Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s] from further new PBSAs and also conversions from private housing to HMOs.”“I would ask that the council does what it can to force developers of PBSAs to produce more affordable accommodation and less ‘luxury’ accommodation. Not only do a large number of permanent residents object to so much land being used for student housing, preventing its use for their children and grandchildren, many of them can only dream about living in such luxury. It adds to the resentment that many residents feel towards the university and its students.”The minutes also recorded a recognition of a “growing dichotomy between university ambitions and community concerns. Whilst issues of noise, parking and bin collection were long-standing there was now a growing concern regarding the impact on the built environment, the latter in particular exacerbating public perception on the impact on the city of the growth in student numbers.”This year’s report on the issue to Planning Member Working Group, which is also unpublished, expressed further scepticism about the value of the university’s expansion forecasts and resulting council student number projections.It went further, admitting that the number of students living in HMOs had increased and that the most optimistic PBSA construction rates would still only provide housing for 57% of the university’s students by 2023-24. (This proportion was based on another incorrect student numbers projection, which had been comfortably exceeded two years before the report was written.)The week before the report Councillor Morse, Executive Portfolio Holder for City Development, admitted that “the council was not able to undertake regular or proactive compliance monitoring in relation with the Article 4 directive area” and said that the council had instead historically relied on complaints from members of the public who suspected that properties were being used as HMOs without the necessary permissions.She continued: “The number of such complaints was however very low - there being two in 2017, one in 2018 and none since then.”When asked how likely it was that unlawful HMO conversions in the Article 4 direction area were “slipping through the net”, Councillor Morse replied that, because of the council’s reliance on complaints and its “limited capacity for additional monitoring and enforcement of the Article 4 restrictions”, it did not “have any data on the impact on residential character”.Despite confirming that it did “not have the monitoring evidence to be able to draw clear conclusions” on the Article 4 restrictions, or the resources to monitor or enforce them, the city council nevertheless made some extraordinary claims in this year’s report on the issue to Planning Member Working Group, apparently still hoping to defend its existing policies.Acknowledging the significant continuing increases in class N council tax exemptions, it nevertheless insisted that “the council’s existing planning policies have contributed to the reduced number of student HMOs”. Even its own figures, cited in the report, showed that the number of student HMOs had risen by nearly 300 between 2019 and 2021 alongside the record provision of 2,230 new PBSA bedspaces.It also demonstrated, perhaps unintentionally, that the effect of the Article 4 direction had been both the construction of significant amounts of PBSA inside the area boundary (notwithstanding the St James Neighbourhood Plan) and significant increases in student HMOs outside it (contradicting the oft-repeated claim that students will only live close to campus).At least it had the honesty to admit that “the number of student HMOs within some parts of the Article 4 area may continue to increase” as well as that at least 4000 residential dwellings are now occupied by students in Exeter.Remarkably, the report nevertheless concluded that “the overall picture is one of the council’s existing planning policies helping to reduce the increase of student HMOs in the city”. This piece of statistical sophistry was then rephrased as “the council’s existing planning policies appear to have helped reduce student HMOs in the city” in the minutes.Unsurprisingly, one councillor observed that the claimed decrease in student HMOs is difficult to “feel” because of the overall increase in student numbers.Council officers went even further in their reports to November’s Executive committee meetings in response to the Pennsylvania petitioners, repeating the panoply of misrepresentations we have examined and which they seem determined to assert despite all the evidence.They claimed the current number of students in Exeter is less than the university’s own published figures. They presented university expansion projections which relied on assumptions about part-time student numbers and the number of students living at home which their own reports have identified are faulty. And they concluded that fewer students will need term-time accommodation in Exeter by 2025-26  than already do.They also continued to assert that class N council tax exemptions are an “indicator of the distribution of the student population” and said such exemptions had decreased despite their own records making clear the opposite is true. And they claimed “only limited increases in the numbers of HMOs in Sylvan Road and Sylvan Avenue and none in Moorview Close since 2015” despite candidly acknowledging their failure to monitor the situation.  Exeter Article 4 direction &amp;amp; HMO SPD history            September 2010 - update on government small HMOs changes, need for Article 4 direction, Exeter HMO policies (cf. August 2010 Planning  Member Working Group)              December 2010 - Article 4 consultation report inc. second St James residents’ petition              March 2011 - Article 4 direction HMO Supplementary Planning Document draft              July 2011 - Article 4 direction HMO Supplementary Planning Document - 20% threshold plus report              January 2012 - Article 4 Direction adopted (following 12 months’ notice)              September 2013 - Article 4 direction extension plus public consultation results              January 2014 - Article 4 direction extension adoption      The city council’s conviction that its Article 4 and 75% additional PBSA policies have succeeded is an article of faith, not a conclusion based on fact. As Councillor Percy Prowse, who has represented residents near the university since 2007, said earlier this month: “It is abundantly clear that the issues of HMO licences and/or conversion of houses into HMOs know no bounds in Exeter.”The council’s single-minded self-belief seems to have undermined its ability to admit that it has made a series of major mistakes around its student accommodation planning policies. But its initial response to the Pennsylvania petitioners, to do nothing until after the new local plan has been adopted, which is likely to mean at least another four years of student encroachment on residential housing stock, suggests something more like hubris. (It also reflects the council’s focus on tailoring the local plan to facilitate the Liveable Exeter development scheme for 12,000 new dwellings and its ancillary development fund.)The council has form in this area. In December 2019 it said it would prepare a Code for Sustainable Homes to set out more detail on how the council expected developers to meet sustainable construction and low carbon energy standards. The new code was scheduled for adoption in January this year, but the council scrapped it instead. It also promised a new student accommodation and co-living policy in August last year but then decided not to follow through at the same time it was considering the controversial Harlequins redevelopment. It said that the policy would also have to wait for the new local plan as that is “the appropriate way to develop new policy”.The new local plan has already been delayed by five years by the failed Greater Exeter Strategic Plan. The council could instead have spent this time developing a new local plan, which would almost certainly have been adopted by now, including new student accommodation policies.Nevertheless, the council does not have to wait for the new local plan to introduce such policies. Local planning authorities are free to make planning policy at any stage, whether in parallel with local plan development or otherwise.Manchester City Council, for example, adopted a co-living policy which it introduced on an interim basis despite itself being in the middle of a new local plan development process and subsequently relied on to prioritise the city’s interests in the face of what would otherwise have been unbridled development. The issue is not whether the city council can introduce new student accommodation policies, but whether it wants to.Instead of hiding behind selective interpretations of an untested update to paragraph 53 of the National Planning Policy Framework, as it did in its response to the Pennsylvania petitioners , and embarrassing itself by relying on lines such as “the potential that prevailing conditions are short term could mean that if a review were undertaken now, further work could be required in the not too distant future”, the council could recalibrate its priorities to focus on Exeter’s existing residents.  New Exeter Local Plan  The first among several consultations to come on the new Exeter Local Plan closed on 15 November. Out for consideration and comment were an Issues consultation document and a new Statement of Community Involvement.  The first outlines the key issues the new local plan is intended to address, and is presented alongside the “Exeter 2040 Vision” and “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme. The second outlines the ways in which the public, organisations and “other interested parties” are involved in city planning processes.  Both will be amended following the consultation and brought back for approval by council members before being used as a basis on which a formal draft Exeter Local Plan will be produced next year.  Publication is expected in September 2022, with final plan publication in February 2023, submission to the Planning Inspectorate in June 2023 and examination hearings in October 2023.  The council then expects to adopt the new local plan in June 2024, notwithstanding continuing uncertainty about the government’s controversial planning reform proposals. This is a remarkably optimistic schedule.  A Local Development Scheme sets out a timetable for the preparation of all these documents.Perhaps in order to do so, or perhaps recognising a risk of impending electoral nemesis, councillors deferred the council’s response to the petitioners at the beginning of November, then canvassed the views of Pennsylvania residents.The subsequent report by council officers remained essentially unchanged but the council’s response was effectively amended from do nothing until later to decide later whether to do something. The latter to be based on “a costed proposal to undertake a review, which would be presented to members for their approval and to agree the resources required”.Councillor Morse nevertheless appeared to limit the scope of any review before the decision had even been taken to consider it. During discussion of the deferred decision at 30 November’s Executive meeting she said: “We have to remember that a review of an Article 4 area across the city is a large ask, and that we’ll probably be asking that there are degrees of information so that we are fully informed before we make any decision on the scale and how far it may go because we do need to be realistic, we can’t look at an entire city for this.”She was similarly non-committal about the timetable, saying: “We will be back at some point to discuss those options with the Executive”. Councillor Williams nevertheless said: “We are on the case: just trust us.”Purpose Built Student Accommodation - The Depot in Bampfylde StreetIf Exeter City Council intends to take the interests of the city’s residents seriously, it needs to do more than repeat the many mistakes it has made in setting student accommodation planning policy, whether intentionally or otherwise, and get to grips with the impact the university’s inexorable expansion is having on the city. (It would also do well to stop insulting the residents of Exeter by telling them that the co-living blocks that are coming are anything other than PBSA by another name.)Referring to a “relentless” increase in student housing, Pennsylvania resident John Danvers, speaking at the Executive meeting on behalf of around 150 residents in and around Sylvan Road, said: “Many residents feel unhappy and dissatisfied with what they feel is the indifference of the city council and university authorities to their plight. They request that the council takes their concerns seriously and engages in dialogue and consultation that will lead to action to address these concerns.“Local residents are unwilling to wait until 2024 for a new local plan to come into effect in the hope that this will address their concerns. We’re requesting immediate dialogue, serious consultation and effective action. Unfortunately the report tabled for this meeting […] does not begin to engage with the issues raised in our letters. We consider it to be an inadequate response to what are serious, widespread and growing concerns. These are serious issues and we hope the council will give them the consideration they deserve.”In raising these issues, the Pennsylvania petitioners have not only drawn attention to the impact of university expansion in their community, they have exposed fifteen years of flawed city council student accommodation policy-making. Exeter does not need a limited, partial review of the Article 4 direction “at some point”, it needs a wholesale review of all relevant policy, and the basis on which that policy is being made, as soon as possible.Purpose Built Student Accommodation - The Barn in Bampfylde StreetFirst, the council needs to understand the limitations of the information it holds. It should recognise the fallacy of using class N council tax exemptions as a proxy for student occupation of residential accommodation, and either stop relying on them altogether or use them appropriately by doubling the number of such exemptions to produce a more accurate estimate of student penetration of the city’s housing stock.And if it cannot produce accurate estimates of Exeter HMO numbers to return to central government it should not rely on them to make local policy either.Second, it should derive term-time student accommodation requirements on the basis of accurate figures, both of the true total number of university students in Exeter, not FTEs, and the true number of those who actually live at home. The university holds this information.But the city council should not rely on the university to provide it with student growth projections, which it knows have repeatedly proved to be huge underestimates. It should begin with long-term averages based on accurate figures, then assume this represents the lowest end of a range which it should also be able to calculate using real-world data.Third, it needs accurate information on student occupation of residential accommodation in the city that does not depend on class N council tax exemptions as a proxy. The university also holds this information. The council does not need to be able to personally identify individual students, it needs to understand the true extent of student saturation of Exeter’s housing stock. Any necessary data pseudonymisation should also be a straightforward matter.The university is supposed to be the city council’s partner in myriad ways. Its recently refreshed corporate strategy strongly emphasises its relationship with the city and the recent Exeter Civic University Agreement goes further still. It’s ex-Vice Chancellor chairs Liveable Exeter Place Board while its current Vice Chancellor and another university representative both also have seats. The university also has a seat on the board of Exeter City Futures from where it promotes Exeter as an “analytical city, where everyone has access to city data and it is used to inform and drive better decision making”.There are numerous examples of the university’s integration into the city, yet it appears to treat Exeter as an externality, at least in respect of the impact of its expansion on the city’s residential housing stock.All the evidence the city council could ever need to compile a detailed evidence base to support the case for a much broader revised Article 4 direction area under the revised National Planning Policy Framework should be readily available just a phone call away. It behoves the university to provide it.Purpose Built Student Accommodation - Kingfisher in Western WayGiven accurate information on student occupation of residential housing stock, it will be clear that the impact of the university’s expansion on the city is far wider and more profound than the council’s faulty figures currently show (or, perhaps, that it is willing to admit). Unless the university is willing to cap its own student numbers, its expansion will continue to consume the city’s neighbourhoods, devouring its residential housing stock supply.It will also be clear that any revision to the Article 4 direction area would have to involve very significant expansion to address that impact. (Like Devon County Council’s active travel road closures, restrictions which are anything less than system-wide simply push the problem elsewhere.)However there is little point in the council spending time and resources on a policy which is intended to restrict the conversion of residential housing stock to HMOs if it refuses to allocate the resources to either monitor or enforce it. An expanded but unenforced Article 4 direction would be just as ineffective as the current Article 4 direction already is. The council can provide the required resources via an increase in the Community Infrastructure Levy on PBSA development, which currently gets a 50% discount.Given that the council cannot constrain the university’s growth, it must also change its PBSA planning policy if it wants to mitigate the university’s impact on the city. Instead of aiming for 75% of additional students in PBSA, the policy must be to accommodate all of them that way. Just as 772 St James residents said in their petition eleven years ago.Then it must go further, with the aim of PBSA providing all term-time university student accommodation. Even then, it would take years to reclaim the city’s residential housing stock from student occupation. But without setting clear target dates for achieving each of these aims the council cannot hope to do so.In addition, unless the council wants the development of PBSA to continue to wipe out city centre employment, retail and service delivery sites, sucking money out of Exeter while consuming valuable development land which might otherwise be used for economically productive purposes, it must also restrict the locations of future off-campus PBSA development to suitable sites.

On what basis would the university see fit to object to these policies? In its application to redevelop the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village area of its Streatham campus, it said that it relies on luxury accommodation “to attract the highest calibre of students to Exeter”. And the university makes handsome profits from the construction and operation of PBSA on its land too.While parts of the 300 acre Streatham campus must be protected, there are still plenty of car parks that will soon become redundant if the city’s carbon reduction plans are to be delivered. And nothing prevents the university buying development land elsewhere, building without parking provision and instead providing mobility services to enable students to travel between campus and halls with ease.Requiring the university to develop PBSA on its own land would also compel it to take direct responsibility for its expansion. Instead of partly relying on ad hoc private development of PBSA, the supply of which fluctuates out of sync with student numbers, which is in the interests of neither residents nor developers, the university could plan its own PBSA development then match its student numbers growth with its construction schedule.Instead of addressing the Pennsylvania petitioners’ concerns by proposing a partial review with so little scope that its production would be waste of public money, and continuing to pave the way for the university’s expansion, it is time that the city council compelled the university to deal with the consequences of its growth in its own back yard.FOOTNOTESThe research for this story involved accessing a wide range of resources, including University of Exeter annual reports and financial statements and Exeter City Council planning policies covering the last twenty years, as well as dozens of Planning Member Working Group and Executive committee reports, central government planning policies, publications and datasets, Higher Education Statistics Agency data and Exeter’s HMO register. (University of Exeter students attending courses at its Penryn campus in Cornwall, which it shares with Falmouth University, formerly Falmouth College of Arts, have been excluded from the above data where appropriate.)It also involved accessing a range of unpublished council reports and documents via freedom of information requests, the use of which was criticised by councillors at a recent Executive meeting, the same meeting at which the Pennsylvania petition was initially presented. One Executive member singled out “local journalists”, described a rise in information requests as “a concern” and “a frightening waste of officer time”, and cited “a high degree of transparency to the work of the council anyway”.Exeter Data Mill, which was created by Exeter City Council in partnership with Exeter City Futures with the aim to make “the city’s data more open and deliver insight into the ways in which we can all make our city a better, more fulfilling place to live”, contains none of the student numbers, HMO information, council tax N exemptions or PBSA data that enabled this analysis.Readers may also like to note that Steve Smith, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Exeter from October 2002 to August 2020 was awarded Freedom of the City of Exeter in February 2019. He has been chair of the unelected Liveable Exeter Place Board, the membership of which is appointed secretly and to which aspects of local governance, in particular property development, has been outsourced since its creation in July of the same year.They may also like to note that Karime Hassan, who joined Exeter City Council as its Director of Economy and Development in February 2011 and has been its Chief Executive and Growth Director since 2013, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Exeter in July 2019, the same month in which he recommended that the city council establish the Liveable Exeter Garden City Board which became Liveable Exeter Place Board."

"content" : "Devon Pension Fund came to prominence in February this year when it was identified as one of the UK’s largest local authority fossil fuel investors, holding significant stakes in companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP and ExxonMobil.The fund has more than 39,000 members who work for over 200 public sector employers in the region. Many of these organisations, which include unitary, district, town and parish councils, education establishments and other public bodies, have declared climate emergencies, including Devon County Council which oversees the management of the fund.Since February several protests have taken place demanding that the fund dispose of its fossil fuel company investments. In September, a protest camp pitched outside County Hall and a large demonstration led by Fridays for Future Exeter and Extinction Rebellion Exeter took place while the county council’s Investment and Pension Fund committee met inside.It was discussing whether to move Devon Pension Fund’s passive equity allocations to a set of investment portfolios which would only incrementally reduce the fund’s fossil fuel investments, with no prospect of them being removed altogether.Last Friday, the committee met again to consider a motion brought by Green Party councillor Jacqi Hodgson proposing much more rapid divestment than the September meeting had agreed.Rather than restricting itself to justifying its policies and simply dismissing Councillor Hodgson’s motion, as it might have done, the county council filleted the motion, replacing most of its content and all of its intent with statements that simply reasserted the council’s existing position.Councillor Hodgson said: “I’ve got huge concerns about the rewriting of the motion presented. It completely undermines the basis of what my motion said.”The difficulty for the county council in adopting this dubious manoeuvre is that, as the past six months have shown, its position on fossil fuel investment has become increasingly untenable.Councillor Jacqui Hodgson talks with protestors at County Hall. Photo © Vanessa Miles.This is not because its contention that divestment has limited potential to influence major oil and gas companies is incorrect.While the fossil fuel divestment movement has grown significantly in size and influence over the past ten years, has contributed to the social stigmatisation of oil and gas companies and is likely to influence some investment decisions as well as policy-making, there is little conclusive evidence that it has had a direct adverse impact on their share price to earnings ratio, the basis of their market valuations.Divestment is also fundamentally limited as a climate change mitigation strategy because around 75% of the world’s crude oil production is controlled by companies which are either mostly or entirely owned by states including Brazil, China, Russia, Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.The shareholder-owned companies in which Devon Pension Fund is invested are small by comparison: by market valuation Shell is just 1/25th of the size of Saudi Aramco, which has been the single greatest contributor to global carbon emissions of any company since 1965.Nevertheless, Devon County Council’s position that Devon Pension Fund’s fossil fuel holdings confer significant potential to influence the actions of those oil and gas companies that are listed on stock exchanges is also incorrect.It claims that shareholder control over company operations and shareholder lobbying is sufficient to transform an industry which is incapable of relinquishing its existing business model and which is happy to try to pass off development plans which depend on continued oil and gas exploration, extraction and combustion as Paris Agreement-compatible.County Hall camp protesters. Photo © Vanessa Miles.Devon Pension Fund investment in fossil fuel companies does not give it control over their operations partly because Devon Pension Fund does not directly own shares in these companies, but instead invests in pooled passive equity investment funds which own such shares to reduce fund management costs.These funds are managed on Devon Pension Fund’s behalf by Legal &amp;amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which directs voting on behalf of the shareholders for which it is responsible.LGIM is Britain’s biggest fund manager, overseeing more than £1.2 trillion of assets. It is accountable to its fund unit holders, including Devon Pension Fund, in respect of such votes. But Devon Pension Fund’s holdings are relatively small, and LGIM has to consider all its investors when deciding how to vote, so Devon County Council investment policy has very little, if any, direct influence on which way LGIM votes on its behalf.As the county treasurer said in a report to September’s Investment and Pension Fund Committee, LGIM “come to their own conclusions on voting”.County Hall protest camp banners. Photo © Vanessa Miles.We can see the limits of the shareholder control Devon County Council claims in practice in votes that took place at the 2021 AGMs of the three fossil fuel companies in which Devon Pension Fund has most money invested: BP, Shell and ExxonMobil.Fossil fuel industry shareholder activist group Follow This submitted a resolution to BP’s AGM in May which challenged the company to set and publish greenhouse gas emissions targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement, covering all scopes including its suppliers and the consumption of its energy products.BP’s board recommended that shareholders vote against the resolution, claiming that the company’s existing strategy was Paris Agreement-compliant despite its aim to reduce the “carbon intensity” of the products it sells by just 50% by 2050.LGIM used the shares it manages on behalf of Devon Pension Fund, among many others, to vote with the board and against the Follow This resolution.However when Devon Pension Fund’s investment managers instead pursue progressive outcomes, other shareholders may not. Follow This submitted a similar motion to Shell’s AGM the following week, which LGIM supported because it did not believe the company’s plan could “credibly claim alignment with a 1.5°C pathway”. But it lost the vote.County Hall protest camp banner.

Three were successfully elected with LGIM’s votes in support.However ExxonMobil’s CEO subsequently declined to make specific pledges or to stop lobbying against climate initiatives when directly asked to do so by the chair of a congressional oversight committee.And a recent report by think tank InfluenceMap, which analysed the world’s 350 largest industrial companies and their industry associations to assess their impact on climate policy and regulations, confirmed that ExxonMobil is still the world’s most negatively influential global company on Paris-aligned climate policy.County Hall protest camp.

Its CEO subsequently issued a defiant statement in which he insisted the company had been playing a leading role in decarbonising the sector, questioned the Hague court ruling and confirmed the company would appeal against it.He also said that the company expects to continue selling oil and gas products for “a long time to come” and said that it would not help the world “one bit” if it “stopped selling petrol and diesel today”.He later confirmed that the company had no intention of changing its strategy despite the court ruling, which applies only in the Netherlands in any case.Shell has since set out a plan to cut the emissions for which it is responsible by just 5% by 2030, a strategy which its CEO called “incredibly coherent”.Youth Strike for Climate march in Bedford Square.

It said it would “engage with the incoming chair”. What was the consequence of this engagement? It said the outcome of the sole meeting it had held with Shell was “dialogue”.Nor did it make any impact on the other major fossil fuel companies in which Devon Pension Fund invests. It said it was “awaiting response” after seeking a meeting with BP, and recorded no attempt to meet with ExxonMobil at all.As Councillor Hodgson pointed out, the county council’s filleted version of her motion included the claim that “continued engagement has a significant role to play in achieving progress and combating climate change” but failed to “recognise that engagement isn’t likely to bring about any change in the fundamental business model of fossil fuel majors, and has not done so in the past”.Topsham Road protest march. Photo: Leigh Curtis.In repeating this line on “engagement” Devon County Council is following government guidance that pension fund managers should resist climate change divestment campaigns and “instead engage with the companies in an effort to influence their actions”.However it is not clear why it would trust the government’s advice in these matters. Three weeks before COP26 the government won a court challenge to its decision to grant a permit to BP to drill for 30 million barrels of oil in the North Sea after its lawyers argued that carbon emissions from burning oil extracted by BP are “not relevant” when granting such permits.Indeed, as the county solicitor admitted in a briefing note to last week’s Investment and Pension Fund committee, “engagement” with fossil fuel companies is just as unlikely to stop them polluting as divestment.And as the county council acknowledges, revenues are a far more significant driver of fossil fuel company operational activity than investment. The county solicitor cited Shell as an example, pointing out that the company has raised no new capital through share issues for the past four years but has received £1.219 trillion in revenues.She also observed that reducing demand for its products is the key to depriving Shell of resources, something which Devon Pension Fund cannot influence via shareholder activism, lobbying or any other means.County Hall protest speeches.

Photo: Leigh Curtis.Analysis of the financial performance of energy companies by Imperial College and the International Energy Agency also concluded that the oil and gas majors would not be more profitable were they to transition to renewables, at least in the short to medium term.This is partly because of high cost barriers which deter new entrants to the markets which they currently dominate, preventing competition, and partly because their profit margins are much higher than those in the renewable sector.Professor Brett Christophers reinforced this conclusion, citing research by Andreas Malm which found that hydrocarbon production remains significantly more profitable for operating companies than renewable energy generation, with internal rates of return on the former around 15-20% and the latter around 5-6%.He said profit is the reason that BP plans to start seven new hydrocarbon production projects next year, and will continue to be the reason energy companies concentrate their activity in fossil fuels, not renewables, for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile the enormous profits fossil fuel companies continue to make (BP 2021 Q3 profits were $3.3 billion and Shell $4.13 billion) are not being directed towards extra investment in renewables as per the county council’s jsutification for its investment position. BP began promoting investor share buybacks last month at an ongoing rate of a $1 billion each quarter.County Hall protest oil poured over protestors. Photo: Leigh Curtis.At the same time fossil fuel company emissions reduction plans will not produce the outcomes they claim, or those the world needs.Professor Gail Whiteman and Professor Johan Rockström assessed Shell’s corporate “energy transition strategy” just before its AGM this year.They said: “Rather than reducing its emissions, Shell plans to offset gigatonnes of emissions by planting trees to capture carbon. It says that reforestation and other nature-based technology will be enough to allow its expanding operations. But Shell’s Sky scenario requires a forest the size of Brazil to offset the volume of carbon it intends to continue pumping out.”“Shell sees oil and gas playing a role in our global economy for many decades to come. Science says that is simply not feasible if we want to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.”Engine No.1’s analysis of ExxonMobil found that it not only excludes around 90% of its emissions from emissions reductions targets which it claims are “consistent” with the Paris Agreement, but has set targets for emissions reduction that are actually higher than its historic emissions levels.And oil industry executives were restricted to side meetings at COP26 because their plans are not science-based: the measurement methodologies they propose and on which their emissions reduction plans depend don’t yet exist.County Hall protest action. Photo: Leigh Curtis.It is no surprise, then, that many organisations have decided to fully divest from fossil fuel companies while there are others who will still pay them for their shares.The largest public pension fund in Washington D.C. purged its $6.4 billion fund of all direct holdings in fossil fuels five years ago.The University of Exeter decided to fully divest its endowment fund two years ago and Harvard University said it will no longer invest its $42 billion endowment fund in fossil fuels earlier this year.And a few weeks ago ABP, Europe’s largest pension fund, announced that it will have sold its entire €15 billion investment in fossil fuel companies by the spring of 2023. Its chairman said it had been unable to use its position as a shareholder to persuade the companies in which it had invested to transition sufficiently quickly towards decarbonisation.DivestInvest, an organisation which has tallied such commitments since 2014, says that nearly $40 trillion of divestment commitments have now been made by more than 1500 institutions.Even the International Energy Agency, which was established to ensure the energy supplies of rich, industrialised countries in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, has now concluded that all investment in new coal, oil and gas production must cease immediately and all exploration and development of new oil and gas fields must halt this year to give the world an even chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C.County Hall protest action. Photo: Leigh Curtis.Devon County Council nevertheless remains confident that its pension fund investment position is not only correct, but leads the way for others to follow.Councillor James Morrish, Investment and Pensions Fund Committee chair, described its September decision to move the fund’s passive equity allocations as a “landmark decision” despite the change only incrementally reducing the fund’s fossil fuel investments, with no prospect of them being removed altogether.But confidence does not explain why it chose to conflate investment in fossil fuel production with the much broader issue of the whole pension fund’s carbon footprint at last week’s committee meeting, despite this not being the focus of Councillor Hodgson’s motion.The assistant county treasurer said: “To achieve the goal of addressing climate change we need the global economy to move, and if we are to achieve net zero as a fund that means that, in effect, the companies we invest in all need to achieve net zero.“That’s not just about disinvesting in fossil fuel suppliers, its about everybody reducing their emissions. We need that pool of companies that are net zero if we are going to have net zero portfolios. At the moment we are relying on the companies to actually take action if we are to achieve that. We cannot control that.”Aside from the acknowledgement that Devon County Council cannot control the decarbonisation strategies of companies in which it invests, echoed from the county solicitor’s briefing note, this statement fails to discriminate between companies which are not engaged in fossil fuel production but whose operations nevertheless still produce some greenhouse gases, and companies whose business models are the discovery, extraction, production and sale of fossil fuels for combustion.Similarly, Councillor James O’Dwyer said: “Full disinvestment, I believe, leaves us with a reduced amount of businesses we could invest with and would present an increased risk to the whole fund”. Is there so little choice of global investment options that divestment from fossil fuel companies would put Devon Pension Fund more at risk than its continuing investment in those companies already does?Protestors hold banner in Bedford Square. Photo: Leigh Curtis.Devon Pension Fund’s members depend on Devon County Council’s Investment and Pensions Fund Committee to take responsibility for their interests. The committee members have a legal duty, as Councillor Hodgson’s motion pointed out, to treat the fund’s members “fairly as between them”. This means, among other things, seriously considering the long-term interests of younger members, who are more likely to be significantly affected by climate change than older members.And there is no legal barrier to a pension fund selling off its fossil fuel investments. According to trade body the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, which represents 1,300 pension funds, the fidicuiary duty of trustees to ensure the best returns for pension fund members is consistent with divestment on financial grounds.These include the increasing risk of oil and gas company assets being rendered worthless as investors exit the sector, something former Bank of England governer Mark Carney has repeatedly warned about.Most committee members also seem oblivious to the wishes of those Devon Pension Fund members who want the fund to divest simply so their pensions do not depend on active participation in fossil fuel exploration, extraction, production and combustion.

Councillor Hodgson quoted one pension fund member, who said: “I’ve worked for South Hams District Council for over twenty years in practical conservation and engaging communities with their environment. I cannot base the comfort of my retirement on the destruction of the global environment and the futures of generations to come, and of our own two children.”Councillor Henry Gent echoed her point, saying some pension fund members “simply didn’t want to own shares in fossil fuel companies”.As the 130 MPs who called for the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund to divest from fossil fuels last month put it, they want to “ensure that [their] pensions are not funding climate disaster”.Councillor Hodgson’s original motion proposed a poll of Devon Pension Fund members to seek their views on fossil fuel divestment, but the county council expunged the proposal, along with everything else in the motion which would entail a change in its position.While Devon County Council continues to insist that fossil fuel investment will clean up the hydrocarbon sector, it seems the only option for fund members who don’t want their pension to depend on dirty money is to divest from the pension fund itself, a worst case scenario for individual members which the committee nevertheless appears to embrace.Unfortunately those who are already drawing their pensions are prohibited from doing so."

"content" : "A landmark study of the role of higher education in social mobility has placed the University of Exeter joint bottom in a league table of Russell Group universities, because of its relatively low levels of students from disadvantaged backgrounds and their relatively low earnings after graduation.It was ranked 103rd overall in a survey of 111 higher education institutions in England.The research was performed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in partnership with The Sutton Trust and the Department for Education.It analysed data on socio-economic background, education pathways and adult labour market outcomes for several entire school cohorts, covering close to the full population of England, to provide the clearest picture yet of how higher education attendance influences social mobility chances.A social mobility rate was calculated for universities, subjects and individual degrees, based on entrance rates for students from disadvantaged backgrounds and how many of them go on to be high earners after graduation.Eligibility for free school meals at sixteen was used as the marker of disadvantage, while adult earnings were measured at age 30 to allow time for careers to stabilise and mature.Universities social mobility scatter chart. Source: The Sutton Trust.Equal access to university and an equal chance of labour market success for those who attend it would yield a social mobility rate of 4.4% using this research methodology.Seven universities met or exceeded this benchmark, demonstrating that high levels of social mobility can be achieved via higher education even in the current context of wider inequality.Queen Mary, University of London recorded the highest mobility rate of 6.8% at the top of a group of higher education institutions which combine high access rates for students from disadvantaged backgrounds with high levels of labour market success.The University of Exeter recorded equal lowest social mobility rate in the Russell Group at 0.3%, combining relatively low levels of students from disadvantaged backgrounds with their relatively low earnings after graduation.It also came ninth from bottom in the national rankings of all higher education institutions in England, just above a handful of specialist institutions including performing arts and drama colleges with low levels of students from disadvantaged backgrounds who also have low earnings prospects.

Exeter is placed above Newcastle in the table because its graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds have slightly better earnings prospects.The study recommended several changes, including increased use of widening participation and social mobility measures in university rankings. Universities are currently rewarded for the school grades of the students they take, a measure which discourages access improvements.It also recommended that the most selective universities make more ambitious use of contextual admissions to widen access. This might include making reduced grade offers to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, reaching out to attract applicants from more diverse communities and providing direct financial support.Goldsmiths College, in twelfth place overall with a social mobility rate of 3.6%, one of the highest among “old” universities, demonstrates this approach.It actively recruits students who live near its South East London campus and offers a range of scholarships, bursaries and fee waivers for local residents on low incomes, students from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds, students in financial hardship, students who live in low participation in higher education postcodes, and students who have been in care, are estranged from their families or are refugees or asylum seekers.

Since then the most selective Russell Group universities (Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial and the London School of Economics) have increased the proportion of students they take from disadvantaged backgrounds from 1.7% to 2.2%, while the proportion entering the wider Russell Group has increased from 2.6% to 3.7%.The research nevertheless found that success rates should not be adjusted for those institutions at which access rate changes had taken place, although Russell Group universities have tended to increase access the least while “old” universities and the least selective institutions have increased access the most.Overall, university graduates remain nearly three times as likely as non-graduates to be among the top fifth of earners by age 30 while disadvantaged young people who don’t attend higher education are much more likely to end up in the lowest income groups."

"content" : "Around 500 people marched through Exeter city centre on Thursday evening to highlight the issue of male violence against women in public spaces.Devon Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Services, local feminist groups and students from the University of Exeter organised the protest under the banner of Reclaim the Night Devon to coincide with the first day of 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, an annual international campaign coordinated by the Center for Women’s Global Leadership.The campaign began on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and runs until 10 December, international Human Rights Day.Reclaim the Night march in Exeter High Street. Photo: Merryn Wilson.The march began at St Sidwell’s Community Centre, with protesters chanting “What do we want? Safer streets! When do we want it? Now!” as they made their way down Exeter High Street and through the Guildhall shopping centre, finishing with a rally in Bedford Square.Organisers were keen to ensure the event was inclusive and child-friendly, with marshals on hand to ensure safety. Caroline Voaden from Devon Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Services said the walk was about “visibility rather than confrontation”.Mandy Barnes of Devon Rape Crisis and Sexual Abuse Services said the context in which the march was taking place “reminds us all that violence and harassment is still an ongoing concern for women in Exeter and Devon, as well as across the globe, and that it is a human right for us to be able to feel safe out on the streets where we live.”Protester Karina Gilbert. Photo: Jenna McGill.Protester Karina Gilbert, a 17-year old college student, said: “I’m here because I’m tired of the discrimination I get for the clothes I wear and that people assume that when I wear a short skirt that I’m asking for it.”She added: “I’ve had lots of remarks from men at night-time that have made me feel very uncomfortable. It scares me because I’m only 17 and this might be what my sisters, who are 13 and 11, might go through.”Emma Pope from Feminist Devon also said she did not feel safe walking around at night. She said: “There’s always the cliché — keys in your pocket and make sure I’ve got my mobile phone on just in case I’m in a space where I feel really, really uncomfortable.”Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw, who attended the march, said he thought that the issue of the safety of women and girls “has really come to the fore recently in some very tragic and unfortunate ways”.He added: “It’s something that I think we, collectively, as a society need to do a lot more about and the government certainly needs to do a lot more about.“We have the opportunity now with legislation going through Parliament for the government to do something about this and I very much hope they will listen to the voices of women and men here today and around the country.”In October Prime Minister Boris Johnson personally overruled an attempt to criminalise public sexual harassment under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which is currently at report stage in the Lords.Despite pressure from Home Secretary Priti Patel, women’s rights campaigners and a cross-party alliance of MPs to amend the bill, he claimed there was “abundant” legislation already in place.Reclaim the Night march at the Guildhall shopping centre. Photo: Merryn Wilson.A report published earlier this year by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for UN Women found that more than 70% of women have been sexually harassed in a public space. This rises to 86% among women aged 18-24.Devon and Cornwall Police recorded 4,542 sexual offences in the year to June 2021, with 164,763 sexual offences reported across England and Wales as a whole.Although 84% of sexual offences are perpetrated against women and girls, only one in six female victims report their experiences to the police, often for fear of being disbelieved.And Home Office figures show that fewer than one in 60 rape cases recorded by the police in 2020 resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed.

Police advice at the time was that women should keep themselves safe by not going out at night.Reclaim the Night has since grown across the rest of the country and has evolved to focus on rape and male violence generally. It gained new momentum this year with the high-profile murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa in London, with protests taking place across the UK on Saturday and others scheduled in the coming days.There are parallel efforts under way to teach men to be better allies to women. A men-only programme called Stand by Her began this month in Nottingham, aiming to educate men about issues around harassment and assault faced by women and giving them the skills and confidence to challenge bad behaviour. The programme is also being delivered in London and Greater Manchester.Communities Inc, which created the programme with Nottinghamshire Women’s Aid, said: “Being an ally, showing solidarity or intervening as a bystander can positively impact girls’ and women’s experiences. It also sends a powerful message and sets a better example for other men so girls and women can live their lives without fear.”"

"content" : "The introduction of public access restrictions in two areas of the Exe Estuary has led to increased numbers of birds using the internationally important feeding and roosting sites at Dawlish Warren and Exmouth nature reserves.A three year monitoring study has observed increases in waders and wildfowl including significant numbers of oystercatchers, shelducks, goldeneyes, black- and bar-tailed godwits and curlews, which are under increasing threat.Black-tailed godwits in Exe Estuary. Photo: Joe Harrison.Ecologists began to monitor the wildlife refuges when they were created in February 2018. Boundary markers were installed asking members of the public to voluntarily refrain from entering the refuges during active periods, which differ at the two sites.Dawlish Warren is active all year round, while the Exmouth reserve is only active from mid-September through to the end of December, a period which corresponds with migratory birds using the site for overwintering.Wardens were also available as sources of information and guidance at the refuges, which together comprise 7% of the Exe Estuary and were chosen for their value to bird communities.Oystercatchers and godwits in Exe Estuary. Photo: Joe Harrison.The study found that the wildlife refuges significantly reduced disturbance to protected bird species, while confirming that they are located in the right places and cover the most critical times of year.It also found that the decrease in human activity resulted both from “reasonable levels of compliance” with the restrictions by members of the public and lower footfall during coronavirus pandemic lockdown periods, although there were increases in human activity during holiday periods too.Maximum wildfowl numbers at the Exmouth refuge increased each year during the course of the study and total wildfowl numbers increased at the Dawlish Warren refuge, implying that both sites are becoming more important for birds over time.Black-tailed godwit in Exe Estuary. Photo: Joe Harrison.The research was commissioned by the South East Devon Habitat Regulations Partnership following the Exe Disturbance Study, published in 2011, which stressed the need to mitigate the impact of local development on the estuary’s wildlife.The number of residential properties within 10km of the River Exe has increased by 11.9% in the last decade, resulting in greater numbers of people using the estuary for recreational purposes, with a corresponding adverse effect on local wildlife.Annual variations in bird numbers may also be affected by factors including adult survival and breeding success as well as food availability, water quality and climatic impacts.Wigeons in Exe Estuary.

It contains two Sites of Special Scientific Interest and is a Special Protection Area and a Ramsar site.It contains a diverse range of habitats including mudflats, saltmarshes and sandflats which support eelgrass and extensive mussel beds and provide rich foraging and sheltered roosting sites for waders and wildfowl including many migratory species.During winter, tens of thousands of birds depend on the Exe Estuary to rest and feed on their long migratory journeys, from places as far away as Siberia."

"content" : "St Thomas Church hosted the area’s first community winter market on Saturday, with stalls and activities spread throughout its Cowick Street churchyard and buildings and festoon lighting strung between the trees to create a festival feel.Organised by local volunteers, the event was funded with small grants from Exeter City Council and Devon County Council and sponsorship by local firms.Event organiser Sophie Yeates, a painter and decorator who has lived in St Thomas for twenty years, said she felt St Thomas was an overlooked area but was now “growing stronger and stronger” with “a community feel and lots of families moving in”.She said: “There’s so many creative people who live in this area and there’s lots of these lovely markets popping up all over the place around the city.“I thought, ‘Why haven’t we got something like that?’ — that’s where the whole idea came from.”Crowds and stalls in St Thomas’ churchyardTraders sold goods ranging from hand-printed cushions to vegan chocolates inside and outside the church building. A children’s storyteller held court in the church hall, where there was also a festive wreath-making workshop and an exhibition by Theatre Alibi.Artist Steve McCracken, who is responsible for the colourful birds which popped up across the city’s streetscape during lockdown, held an outdoor art workshop for children and displayed the canvasses they created against the church walls.Entertainment included a kids’ silent disco and Devon drumming group Tano Taiko, whose members delivered thundering performances in front of a large crowd.Community groups including St Thomas Community Garden  were pitched beside local charities including Refugee Support Devon, Devon Wildlife Trust and Age UK Exeter.St Thomas Community Garden volunteersAccording to Sophie Yeates, a “really big part” of the St Thomas winter market was providing support to fledgling traders by offering “mini pitches”, smaller stalls which cost less to hire than the larger stalls which were used by more established sellers.She said: “There’s just loads of people that have not really done this before. Maybe they don’t have the confidence to put themselves out there, or for whatever reason, but it’s been quite important that we’ve tried to encourage them.”Kiara Baars was selling handmade friendship bracelets from her mini pitch. She said: “I’m a starting-out trader. I’ve only done a couple of stalls so far and this one’s the best one I’ve been to for sure. There are so many people here and it’s a lot of business”.Another mini pitch trader, illustrator Marson Wu, who was trading for the first time at the event, said: “I was a bit nervous but now it’s nice to be around people and see different creative things”.First time trader illustrator Marson WuCo-organiser Jocelyn Mills said the event had been a success: “The footfall has been absolutely extraordinary today. We didn’t expect this for a first time event here but so many people have said how brilliant it is to see the space being used, and it’s such a gorgeous site. We’ve had some amazing feedback.”She said she hoped the market would attract more funding in the future to enable it to programme more artists, musicians, storytellers or other entertainment.“We’d love to do more of that, and have a broader diversity of people and what they can bring, in terms of what they make or what their skills are.”She added: “We’re definitely keen; the heart, the motivation, the core driver of us all being residents of St Thomas , wanting to do something to animate the spaces in our community.”Traders inside St Thomas’ ChurchSt Thomas winter market was one of several outdoor markets taking place in Exeter in the run-up to Christmas.The revamped Eastgate Market opened on Sidwell Street on Friday, where it will trade every Thursday, Friday and Saturday from now on, and Fore Street Flea returned with a festive theme on Sunday. Both are delivered by InExeter.Exeter Cathedral’s Christmas market also opened last week for its fourth year, and Magdalen Road will be closed to through traffic on Saturday 4 December for the long-running St Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association Christmas fair."

"content" : "Exeter City Council has granted planning permission for a second co-living block as part of the Harlequins shopping centre redevelopment, replacing the hotel that was agreed last October despite vehement opposition from residents, campaigners and conservation charities.The scheme’s developer had secured permission to build a 251-bed co-living block and a 116-bed hotel on the site, subject to planning conditions which were met by the end of April this year.However it then submitted a revised application to return to an earlier, rejected, vision for the 1.04 hectare site, replacing the hotel with a second co-living block to build 383 co-living bedspaces along the length of Paul Street.The developer claimed the impact of coronavirus since its November 2019 planning application justified the scheme’s reversion to wholesale co-living. But the scheme was twice substantially revised after the application was submitted, first in May 2020, two months after the pandemic arrived in the UK, and again in July. The hotel remained a fixture throughout.The application was not decided until the end of October last year, by which time the second wave of the pandemic was well under way. Jones Lang LaSalle, the applicant’s agent, continued to extol the benefits of the hotel in a letter sent to the council on the day its planning committee met.The consent that was granted for the previous scheme then became a material consideration in the revised application, tilting this week’s decision in favour of approval.Harlequins revised redevelopment scheme - block two model view of Paul Street elevation. Image: Corsorphine &amp;amp; WrightMonday’s planning committee meeting, at which permission for the revised scheme was granted, considered a report and presentation prepared by the same city council planning officer who dealt with the previous scheme.Various claims about the economic, social and environmental benefits of the development were given significant weighting in the original decision, and many have been retained. But the effect of replacing the hotel with a co-living block necessitated a new economic impact assessment.This estimates that the revised development “could support” a net total of 36 new jobs in the local economy. This is 20 fewer than the previous plans, but the planning officer was unable to confirm this when asked by committee members as he couldn’t recall the content of his previous report despite revisiting much of its content in the revised report.The new economic impact assessment says that the development’s value has shrunk by 17%, but there was no mention of this change in the planning officer’s report and nothing was said about it during the committee meeting either.The difference is worth £1.5 million to Exeter’s economy every year, two and half times all the one-off developer contributions required to mitigate the impact of the development put together.The planning officer’s report nevertheless contained some striking statements, including a description of the development’s gas-fired heating system as “renewable”. It also called the development “car free” — except for the two disabled spaces, two electric vehicle spaces, nine other car parking spaces and two service lay-bys for delivery vehicles and residents’ drop-off-pick-up parking that it provides.It did not, however, mention the carbon footprint of demolition and redevelopment using construction materials with very high levels of embodied energy.Council leader Phil Bialyk, who sits on the planning committee despite national Planning Advisory Service guidance to the contrary, praised what he said were the development’s high environmental standards. He said: “For all those people, including me, who are concerned about the environment, just think about that impact.”  Student accommodation by the back door?  The scheme’s developer Curlew is responsible for nearly 10,000 UK student beds.  It is a privately-owned, non-listed development and investment management company that specialises in student accommodation and build to rent in the UK and the Netherlands.  It is part of a complex group of companies of which at least 73 are registered off-shore in Guernsey.  One of the company’s senior development managers, who joined it in April 2020, was previously responsible for the development of controversial 360-bed student blocks behind Exeter City Football Club’s ground at St James Park and another 150 beds at Exeter Cricket Club’s ground on Prince of Wales Road.  They were developed by Yelverton Properties, itself part of a complex group of companies and responsible for a 500+ bed student block on Western Way.The revised Harlequins scheme is described as “very similar” to the previously approved plans. The additional co-living block will be “marginally” less tall than the previously approved hotel, and the internal layouts of both blocks have been altered, with slight increases in room sizes and shared communal space.According to the planning application amenity space has been increased by 35 square centimetres per room to an average of 3.19 square metres for each of the 383 bedspaces. This is described in the council planning case officer’s report as “generous levels of communal amenity space”.In the revised plans “cluster rooms” (bedrooms in multi-occupancy flats which share a kitchen) will be “approximately” 1m2 larger, so typically 13.5m2, and most of the studios (which include kitchens and toilet/shower rooms) will be just over 18m2. This is less than half the 37m2 minimum national space standard for a one person dwelling (when it has a shower instead of a bath).The revised plans greatly increase the proportion of studios to cluster flat bedspaces. The co-living block which was approved in October was to include 99 studios and 26 cluster flats containing a total of 152 bedspaces.The revised scheme reconfigures that block to provide 138 studios and 18 cluster flats containing a total of 107 bedspaces, and adds another 133 studios in the block which has replaced the hotel. 72% of the rooms in the new scheme are studios, nearly double the share in the previous scheme. A further five studios will be provided in the upper floors of 21-22 Queen Street.The developer cited the “high density mixed use development” envisaged by the city council’s “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme in support of these arrangements, while council leader Phil Bialyk cited what he apparently considers to be a benefit of living spaces that do not meet minimum space standards, saying: “Your house is too big, you’re using too much carbon”.Harlequins revised redevelopment scheme - heritage assets plan. Image: Exeter City Council.When the council approved the previous Harlequins redevelopment scheme last year, a coalition of local residents and campaigners, conservation charities and community groups including Exeter Civic Society, Devon Archeological Society and Devon Buildings Group, backed by The Victorian Society and The Georgian Group, unsuccessfully appealed to the Secretary of State to call in the decision.Their objections concerned a wide range of factors, in particular the impact on nearby heritage assets that the development would cause. These include the historic city wall that borders the site as well as numerous nearby grade I, II*, II and locally-listed buildings.The council’s conclusion that the cumulative level of harm to these heritage assets was “less than substantial”, as well as the methods that were employed to derive it, were strongly criticised by heritage experts and charities including The Georgian Group and The Victorian Society.This conclusion has not changed, nor has the development’s reduced economic value affected the council’s view that the harm the development will cause to heritage assets is sufficient to outweigh the purported benefits of the scheme.It was also widely assumed that despite the developer’s claim that the scheme will be used for co-living, it is likely to be occupied largely by students. Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell, who is a member of the council planning committee, said that the previous scheme’s co-living block “appears to be, in all but name, more student accommodation”.Keith Lewis of Exeter Civic Society also said: “The co-living accommodation appears to be exactly the same as that presented at consultation earlier in 2019 for student accommodation”.Harlequins revised redevelopment scheme - block plan. Image: Corsorphine &amp;amp; WrightWhen Michael Mitchell sought to ask the developer’s agent, who spoke at Monday’s meeting, what proportion of the Harlequins tenants were expected to be university students, Labour councillor Emma Morse, who is Executive city development portfolio holder and planning committee chair, also despite national guidance intended to ensure that planning decisions are taken in a “fair, impartial and transparent way”, intervened to prevent him doing so.The developer’s agent did, however, confirm that the “affordable private rented” units which will be included in the development will cost a maximum of 80% of the rate paid for purpose built student accommodation in Exeter, currently between £950 and £1340 per month. He went on to say that if these units proved unaffordable to the key workers for whom they are intended, the situation would be “subject to negotiation with the local authority”.Despite the lack of council or association housing in the Harlequins plans, Councillor Ruth Williams, a Labour Executive member who is also the planning committee’s deputy chair, mentioned the 2,200 people on the Devon Home Choice waiting list, saying the development would make a “significant difference to addressing the shortage of accommodation in Exeter”.As Exeter City Council will only accept applicants for this list if they meet very strict criteria which include being homeless, having specific health needs or needing to escape violence, and Devon Home Choice only offers council or housing association homes, it is not clear how the Harlequins development might supply the accommodation they need.

Subscribe freeLabour councillor Rob Hannaford then sought to clarify the expected tenancy length on which the development’s operational plan was based, voicing concerns about potential mental health risks for co-living tenants. He said that while compromising on space or amenity standards might be reasonable in purpose built student accommodation because students only occupy it for short periods, co-living tenants might stay in situ much longer.Councillor Morse intervened again, exhorting the committee to ask “planning-related” and not what she called “predicting the future” questions, saying she wasn’t only having “a dig” at Councillor Hannaford in doing so.As the application to redevelop Harlequins largely concerns demolition, construction and subsequent use, and planning permission is conditional on operational agreements which address the building management issues raised by Councillors Mitchell and Hannaford, and which were before the committee for consideration, it is unclear why this distinction was drawn.At the time of last year’s planning decision Diana Moore, Green Party councillor for St David’s ward, which includes the Harlequins site, described the co-living plans as “warehousing for people”. This week she said she was “dismayed” by the decision to approve the revised application, describing the development as “abysmal”.She said: “It became very clear from the answers the developer gave to my questions that this co-living project is poorly thought through.“Far from meeting local planning requirements to provide mixed developments, vital in an area that already has a high transient population, it will instead provide ‘units of accommodation’ for single people, not the long term homes that our key workers deserve.”"

The Paris Street PR machine forgot to mention that those surveyed need never have visited the city.THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER comms team isn’t so keen on topping league tables, at least when it comes to ranking VC remuneration. It wants to get ahead of an Office for Students report expected later this month in which it is likely to figure prominently after Steve Smith received an £830,000 pay package in his final year on the job (2019-20).The pitch is his “extraordinary success” during his eighteen years at the university, and an “exceptional” bonus-based incentive scheme reflecting the “value and importance” of his experience and expertise.Many of the university’s teaching staff might see the situation differently: by 2016-17 (the last year short term academic employees were included in HESA statistics) the university had become the sixth most insecure employer in the Russell Group, with 64% of all academic staff employed on insecure contracts.His successor Lisa Roberts might also feel short-changed on her £275,000 salary, although this still places her firmly in the global top 1%. Perhaps the university is planning to donate the difference to local communities as part of its new “civic university agreement”?AT THE OTHER END OF THE SCALE the TUC has published the results of a poll which found that nearly a quarter of key public sector workers in the South West are “actively considering” quitting their jobs because of low pay and excessive workloads.NO SUCH IGNOMINY for Torridge and West Devon MP Geoffrey Cox, whose escapades in exotic locations must by now be familiar to most of his constituents.

ON OUR READING LISTCOP26 has prompted plenty of “net zero” analysis at all scales and scopes. The local focus of two think tank reports has stood out.Centre-right Onward continues its examination of decarbonisation policy options at regional and constituency levels in Thin Ice? Understanding voters’ support for net zero [PDF].It finds geography drives larger differences in policy support than demography, with some parts of the South West demonstrating strikingly low levels of support for basic measures such as domestic retrofitting.And cross-party Localis outlines the case for (and barriers against) local government as the delivery vehicle for decarbonisation in COP26: Why Local Delivery Matters [PDF].It finds upsides in key local authority roles in planning policy, environmental protection and waste disposal, and downsides in separate liaison arrangements between local authorities and different central government departments and the ongoing problem of competitive regional bidding for short-term government funds.Meanwhile the Committee on Standards in Public Life, currently never far from the news, has published the final report and recommendations of its Standards Matter 2 review [PDF].The report calls for stronger rules, more independent regulation and a better system of compliance, and proposes an update to the Nolan principle concerning the conduct of public office holders.It now says they “should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour and treat others with respect”, “should actively promote and robustly support the principles” and should “challenge poor behaviour wherever it occurs”, having removed “be willing to” from the final clause.Let’s hope our local leaders are paying attention: these principles apply to everyone in public office at all levels, including city council officers and members.OTHER OTHER NEWSDenis the Dustcart, the council’s refuse and recycling spokesvehicle, flies his anti-capitalist flag high in his latest blogpost.Advocating reduced production and consumption, he takes aim at “humanity’s drive towards constant growth on a finite planet” and cites the “problem plastic produced by consumerism” and the “ecological, environmental and human horror” that goes with bauxite mining for aluminium drinks can production as just two examples among many.Perhaps more council officers should adopt alliterative cartoon alter-egos to express their views?HELP POWER EXETER OBSERVER’S PUBLIC INTEREST JOURNALISMThere are lots of ways you can help Exeter Observer to thrive:      Share this newsletter with your contacts and encourage them to subscribe.

There was also a photography exhibition presenting images of personal responses to the climate crisis from local people.Dr James Dyke, Assistant Director of the University of Exeter Global Systems Institute, delivered a presentation which outlined the seriousness of the climate crisis.His talk included a history of past efforts to tackle the problem, explaining how ineffective they had been, and presented newly-released data which painted a bleak picture of our prospects.While emphasising how much harder effective action would be the longer it was delayed, Dr Dyke nevertheless said that COP26 did not necessarily represent our last chance to prevent runaway climate change.University of Exeter students from the Global Systems Institute flagship MSc Global Sustainability Solutions programme, which Dr Dyke leads, ran an exercise throughout the day in which members of the public contributed category-based responses to climate change challenges.Discussing the perspectives needed for effective action against climate change, the students said that systems thinking is necessary to understand the complex feedback loops it involves.Exeter Community Energy, a community benefit society which enables local renewable energy and energy-saving projects and helps reduce carbon footprints while saving money, also offered information and advice to event attendees.Project Manager Tara Bowers said that Exeter Community Energy’s Healthy Homes for Wellbeing anti-fuel poverty project helped 1145 households to save a total of more than £1 million on their energy bills in the six months from September last year, an average of nearly £900 per household, by providing free practical advice and information in pop up clinics and home calls and visits.Johanna Korndorfer was on hand to describe the projects presented as part of a display made from recycled cardboard, which included the Storied Seed Bank, a set of short personal stories each linked to a particular plant, as well as seed-based artworks.Exeter Seed Bank collects seeds and redistributes them without charge to promote urban gardening in the city while sharing knowledge about seed saving, an ancient craft that is being revived in response to diminishing seed diversity.Recycle Devon was also present on behalf of Exeter City Council, which has recently launched its long-awaited food waste recycling scheme in part of Alphington.Carol Arthur explained it was better to use normal plastic bags to line food waste bins, rather than compostable bags, because of the method the city council was using to separate this waste.Other organisations represented at the event included FLOW Orchard Exeter, a community art project which has created an orchard trail along the River Exe, Exeter Connect, a voluntary and community sector support service, and the Palestine Institute for Biodiversity &amp;amp; Sustainability.A second day of COP-EXE events followed on Saturday, during which venues around the city centre hosted themed drop-ins offering ideas for action around climate change.The Mint Methodist Church Centre hosted Good Food Exeter, Exeter Food Cycle and other sustainable local businesses.Divest Devon campaigned for Devon Pension Fund to divest £157 million of public sector pension money that it holds in fossil fuel investments outside St Petrock’s Church, and St Stephen’s Church presented a faith-based response to the climate crisis.Meanwhile Maketank hosted a day focussed on campaigning and biodiversity with Exeter Seedbank, Devon Wildlife Trust, Global Centre Devon - Devon Development Education, Fairtrade Devon and Labour for a Green New Deal.Extinction Rebellion Exeter engaged passers-by outside on Paris Street. A member of the activist group said: “We have reached a critical stage in the emergency and desperately need people to take action.”"

"content" : "Instead of announcing the biggest council funding rise for over a decade, Exeter City Council’s press team marked budget day by celebrating Exeter’s latest quarterly YouGov popularity rating. The Paris Street PR machine forgot to mention that those surveyed need never have visited the city.In contrast, the University of Exeter comms team isn’t so keen on topping league tables, at least when it comes to ranking VC remuneration. It wants to get ahead of an Office for Students report expected later this month in which it is likely to figure prominently after Steve Smith received an £830,000 pay package in his final year on the job (2019-20).The pitch is his “extraordinary success” during his eighteen years at the university, and an “exceptional” bonus-based incentive scheme reflecting the “value and importance” of his experience and expertise.Many of the university’s teaching staff might see the situation differently: by 2016-17 (the last year short term academic employees were included in HESA statistics) the university had become the sixth most insecure employer in the Russell Group, with 64% of all academic staff employed on insecure contracts.His successor Lisa Roberts might also feel short-changed on her £275,000 salary, although this still places her firmly in the global top 1%. Perhaps the university is planning to donate the difference to local communities as part of its new “civic university agreement”?Meanwhle, at the other end of the scale the TUC has published the results of a poll which found that nearly a quarter of key public sector workers in the South West are “actively considering” quitting their jobs because of low pay and excessive workloads.No such ignominy for Torridge and West Devon MP Geoffrey Cox, whose escapades in exotic locations must by now be familiar to most of his constituents.One Exeter Observer journalist, who has been examining income disparities across the county, found herself asking whether he could be single-handedly responsible for Torridge’s mysteriously high average wages. Presumably not, if his staunch defence of tax havens is anything to go by."

"content" : "The UK government has become increasingly vocal in its support for electric cars, extolling them as the carbon-free future of personal mobility. And the motor vehicle industry has used its financial resources and political power to sell the same message for several years.We could be forgiven for believing that electric cars are the answer to fully decarbonising travel and creating a better future. But do they really solve the low carbon transport challenge? Even a cursory glance is enough to see that a wholesale transition to electric vehicles would fall far short of the future we need to create for ourselves and our children.First, few people can afford electric vehicles. They remain a privilege for those that can. However once purchased they’re cheap to run, so there’s less incentive not to make every journey by car. The economics of recycling used vehicle batteries and inevitable changes in how car journeys are taxed nevertheless makes buying an electric vehicle far from a sure bet for the future.More importantly, the world can’t afford them. Electric vehicle manufacture is carbon intensive (far more so than for fossil fuel cars) and their batteries require the use of scarce materials which are mined and smelted in remote locations where environmental and labour standards are often low. As electric vehicle sales surge, their environmental and social impact will surge too.

Replacing combustion engines with electric motors may be a small part of the future but it will do nothing to make it safer for our children to navigate our world by themselves, nothing to prevent the deaths of the five people who are killed on our roads every day, and nothing to disrupt the obesity-inducing design of our towns and cities. Transporting a single person weighing 75 kilos in a vehicle that weighs two tonnes is not a wise use of resources.It will do nothing to reduce the congestion cars create when driven, nor free up the valuable space they use when parked. It will not help the one in four households who don’t own one. And it will not eliminate the lung-clogging particulates from tyres, brakes and road wear that make up a significant proportion of the particle emissions from all cars, however they are powered.Is all this cause for despair? It might be if there weren’t already a machine that helps fight climate change, which is already owned by many and used by children and adults, disabled and non-disabled alike. A machine that doesn’t kill dozens of people every week. A machine whose lightweight design doesn’t damage roads and so doesn’t waste £40 million each year on pothole repairs in Devon alone.You already know what this machine is, and have probably already used one: the bicycle. The majority of car journeys are under five miles: just half an hour by bike, powered by little more than a slice of toast and a piece of fruit.The news from COP26 has brought fresh reminders of the existential crisis we face, and highlighted how dramatically we must change the ways we travel and heat our homes. Listening to speeches from the Glasgow conference it can be difficult to feel positive about our prospects. However this does not mean we cannot create the future we and our children need.What would this future look like? One in which we’ve decarbonised travel by enabling people of all ages to move efficiently, cleanly and safely without reliance on fossil fuels. One in which our highways are equitably shared by people travelling by foot, scooter, wheelchair, bike or bus. One in which the dominance of cars on our streets has been reversed. This is the clean, safe, fit and friendly city that Exeter Cycling Campaign is working towards.As campaigners we often hear “I don’t cycle because it’s not safe”. But, increasingly, cities across the UK are finding ways to improve cycling safety. Measures including creating protected cycle paths alongside busy roads, removing through traffic from residential areas and introducing reduced traffic speeds (why is 20mph not yet the default in Devon?) all contribute to the creation of an environment where children and adults can switch their everyday, short journeys to walking, scooting or cycling.Recently there has been pushback in Exeter against modest changes that enable safe, low carbon travel. One councillor argued that minor inconvenience for a few drivers should be prioritised over safer journeys for school children, a view that has no place in a forward-looking society. The changes we must embrace to help decarbonise our lives will not only help to avert the worst consequences of climate change, they will also help create a better world for all of us.We have a generational opportunity to change our communities for the better: let’s not mess it up. Let’s not be seduced by the motoring lobby into accepting the fallacy that electric cars are the only answer. Instead let’s embrace a transition away from cars towards active travel. We’ll be a healthier and happier society if we do.And, yes, for those who are unable to walk, scoot, cycle or take the bus, our city will be a better place in which to drive their electric cars too."

"content" : "As David Attenborough reminded COP26 delegates on Monday, what matters most in climate change is the amount of carbon we release into the atmosphere. The message was simple: we have to cut our carbon emissions rapidly and we have to cut them now.It is in this context that Exeter’s Green Party councillors have called for a carbon budget for the city, based on properly calculated baseline emissions and specifying the annual reductions required to meet its decarbonisation goals.They are also calling for an annual report which demonstrates progress towards these goals and evaluates the degree to which the city’s existing decarbonisation plan, the Net Zero Exeter plan produced by Exeter City Futures, is contributing towards them.Councillor Diana Moore said: “In 2019 the UN called for a 7.6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions every year between 2020 and 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5°C. However, we simply have no idea if Exeter has made any progress towards that goal.”Councillor Amy Sparling added: “Just as we need international agreements to succeed we must also take a rigorous approach locally. We believe that a carbon budget for the city is an important evidence-based approach.”In this article we consider the approach taken by Exeter City Council and Exeter City Futures thus far, look at emerging criticisms of “net zero” policies and outline what a proper carbon budget-based emissions reduction plan for Exeter might look like.We also suggest that, should the council and its partners want Exeter “to be recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”, as they claim, it is high time that they consulted some of the city’s many climate scientists on how to frame such a plan.  COP26  The 26th Conference of the Parties (the UN member countries, EU and a few small non-UN member countries which support the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed at the Rio Earth Summit) is taking place in Glasgow until 12 November.  Its main task is produce realistic plans to reduce global carbon emissions to levels that limit global warming to as close to 1.5°C as possible.  This target was decided at the 2015 Paris COP, which agreed to “limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels” by reaching a global greenhouse gas emissions peak “as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century”. It took 23 years to achieve this agreement.  The principal emissions reduction mechanism to deliver these aims is the Nationally-Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country. The UK’s most recent NDC commits it to reducing emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.  However last week the UN warned that we are on course for 2.7°C of warming and said current pledges will only produce reductions of 7.5% by 2030, far less than the 45% cut scientists say is necessary to meet the 1.5°C target.  If emissions don’t fall very rapidly, very soon, too much carbon will already have been added to the atmosphere to prevent dangerous climate change.In July 2019, the city council commissioned Exeter City Futures to conduct a full audit of the city’s current carbon emissions to identify its “baseline state” as well as to “highlight gaps between current plans and what is required to achieve zero carbon”.This audit was a key component of the city’s response to the climate emergency: the decision to commission it was discussed and approved at no fewer than four city council meetings.Exeter City Futures had said it would assemble an academic team with the requisite specialist expertise to establish a “robust definition of what is included in the measurement of Exeter’s carbon emissions” and “how this accounts for the carbon emissions created in the wider region by commuters” as well as a measurement framework to make sense of all the data.However it later admitted, in a December 2019 progress report, that it did not have the “resource capacity” to deliver the promised audit. Nor did it assemble an expert academic team to define the city’s carbon footprint or produce the framework.The council committee which considered the report had nothing to say about these failures.While the Net Zero Exeter plan that Exeter City Futures subsequently produced, and which the council adopted in July last year, acknowledged that “a more comprehensive assessment of the carbon cost will need to be undertaken”, the total of all projected carbon savings from the actions it proposed amount to just 329,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).The lack of alignment between the plan’s proposed actions and Exeter’s emissions is reflected in its presentation: almost all the actions it proposes are framed as vaguely-defined activities, rather than focussed on specific outcomes, and very few include quantifiable measures of success.The plan does not mention the impact of Exeter Airport. A University of Exeter study estimated the airport’s 2016 emissions as around 9% of Devon’s total transport emissions. This suggests it was responsible for more than 200,000tCO2e of emissions in 2019 alone.Nor does the plan address the consumption habits of Exeter’s residents. In 2016 the ONS estimated that 40% of the UK’s carbon footprint related to imported emissions while DEFRA found the proportion had risen to 43% two years later.Exeter City Council climate credentials claim on St Sidwells Point development hoardingFollowing its adoption, Exeter City Futures commissioned a review of the Net Zero Exeter plan by engineering consultants WSP which assessed ten of the plan’s “priority actions”.The primary recommendation of the WSP report, which has not been published, was that a baseline model of Exeter’s greenhouse gas emissions should be created to “allow better analysis and comparison of actions, as well as mapping of ‘business as usual’ and tracking of progress”.Its feedback included that “clarity would be useful on why goals are chosen” and that the overall carbon emissions reduction claims needed “recalculating”.The Net Zero Exeter plan acknowledges that it has limitations, and that it is incomplete work in progress that requires further input and development. However an update was promised by December 2020 and there is still no sign of it nearly a year later.

Since Exeter City Futures unilaterally decided to adopt the term “net zero” to describe Exeter’s decarbonisation plan, against the wishes of city councillors, the term has become the subject of significant criticism.In April James Dyke, Assistant Director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter, co-authored a landmark article criticising the concept of net zero as a “dangerous trap” that “has licensed a recklessly cavalier ‘burn now, pay later’ approach which has seen carbon emissions continue to soar”.The article’s authors said: “Current net zero policies will not keep warming to within 1.5°C because they were never intended to. They were and still are driven by a need to protect business as usual, not the climate.“If we want to keep people safe then large and sustained cuts to carbon emissions need to happen now. That is the very simple acid test that must be applied to all climate policies. The time for wishful thinking is over.”The article provoked intense debate. Greta Thunberg said it was “one of the most important and informative texts I have ever read on the climate and ecological crises” and warned that “net zero targets” are “being used as excuses to postpone real action”.Then in May a survey of 300 climate experts found that 79% thought governments and companies should set separate emissions reduction and offsetting targets to address the risks created by “net zero” policies relying on carbon removal to balance the books.We have nevertheless since been confronted with the spectacle of  Saudi Arabia pledging to reach “net zero” by 2060 without diminishing its position as the world’s leading oil producer, and the chancellor announcing that the UK would become “the world’s first net zero financial centre” without requiring companies or financial institutions to decarbonise or imposing any restrictions which would prevent private investment in fossil fuel development projects.Oil refinery in PembrokeshirePart of the challenge in getting decarbonisation policy right is that climate science is not widely understood, enabling greenwashing and misinformation to mislead many.An advertising agency invented the idea of personal carbon footprints in 2004 as part of a BP marketing campaign called “Beyond Petroleum”, while recent research found that almost half of the 1,700 UK adults surveyed were unable to correctly identify fake climate change news headlines or spot climate-related misinformation they encountered online.We can see this at work locally in the way Exeter City Futures repeated a claim that Exeter had the lowest carbon footprint among UK towns and cities, found in a joint press release from Stockholm Environment Institute and WWF, without first checking whether it was accurate.One might think that the headline statement that Exeter was listed as among towns and cities with populations of more than 250,000 might have rung alarm bells, as the city only has 133,000 inhabitants. Instead the city council and its partner organisations, the council leader and its chief executive, several Exeter Labour councillors and many others repeated the claim in turn.However a cursory examination of the research on which the claim was based turned up several significant issues which would equate (using normative fact-checking methods) to it being somewhere between half true (partially accurate but omitting important details or taking things out of context) and mostly false (containing an element of truth but ignoring facts that would give a different impression).First, the area identified as “Exeter” is more than 75 miles wide, stretching from Axminster to Bude, and covering a population of 410,000.Second, research survey respondents were self-selecting, and constituted just 0.68% of the area’s population. No attempt was made to make their responses more representative via demographic weighting or other techniques.Third, the survey simply captured changes in self-reported behaviour over time. No attempt was made to benchmark survey results against available carbon footprint estimates.Fourth, perhaps most striking of all, the research concluded that Exeter’s carbon footprint was 11.6tCO2e per person per annum, which would make the city’s total carbon footprint more than 1.5 million tCO2e each year.This is nearly 1.2 million tCO2e more than the 329,000tCO2e accounted for in the Net Zero Exeter plan, which would mean that all the carbon savings from the actions it proposes put together would equal less than a quarter of the city’s total emissions.We can also see limited understanding of decarbonisation policy detail in Exeter City Council’s recent decision to scrap its apparent goal of achieving carbon neutral operations by 2022.The decision was taken not only on the basis that the goal was deemed “unachievable” but also that the council hadn’t actually passed a resolution to achieve it in the first place.The goal had been on the council’s risk register since November 2019, since when it has been repeatedly reviewed. It seems the council had been confusing its energy policy with an (apparently non-existent) decarbonisation plan for the previous two years.At the same meeting at which the confusion was discovered, Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell and Conservative councillor Anne Jobson proposed a new risk register item to monitor the council’s ability to meet the 2030 decarbonisation target set for the city.While the meeting agreed the proposal, the council said it would not be able to deliver it until March next year.This is in stark contrast with the claims made by Councillor Rachel Sutton, Executive Portfolio Holder for Net Zero Exeter 2030, in October last year, when she said that Exeter was “in the vanguard of this nationwide challenge” and was “one of the few councils in the country to have set out a road map that was both deliverable and practical”.These followed a press release in which the council said it had put fighting climate change “at the top of its agenda”, quoting a pledge by Council Leader Phil Bialyk that the “ambition of creating a net zero carbon city by 2030 will be at the heart of everything the council does going forward”.Perhaps the use of the word “ambition” is revealing? Its Latin root means “to go around (canvassing for votes)”.Meanwhile the city council and its partners continue to claim, repeatedly, in press releases, policy documents and election manifestos that the Net Zero Exeter plan provides “a clear roadmap to carbon neutrality”.What would Exeter’s decarbonisation plan actually need to include to deliver the progressive annual carbon budget called for by the city’s Green Party councillors, and thus “a clear roadmap to carbon neutrality”?First and foremost, as previously identified (and promised), it needs a “robust definition of what is included in the measurement of Exeter’s carbon emissions”.The UK government uses three key official measures of UK greenhouse gas emissions. BEIS territorial estimates include emissions produced within the UK’s borders, ONS residence estimates cover emissions by UK residents and UK-registered businesses, whether in the UK or overseas, and DEFRA carbon footprint estimates account for the emissions of all goods and services consumed in the UK wherever they are produced in the world.Of these, carbon footprint estimates provide the most comprehensive emissions accounting basis, but methodologies used to produce them vary and are still being refined.In their open letter calling for an Exeter carbon budget, Exeter’s Green Party councillors cite a University of Exeter study commissioned by the Devon County Council-led Climate Emergency Response Group to quantify the county’s carbon emissions at local authority level.However, as the study methodology makes clear, it is based on BEIS territorial estimates, which it only partially extends, without including emissions from aviation, shipping or the net imported emissions which are included in carbon footprint estimates.Despite excluding these emissions, the county council nevertheless claims that the study findings represent “Devon’s carbon footprint”.Source: ONS.More recent research by the Centre for Sustainable Energy and the University of Exeter Centre for Energy and the Environment approaches carbon footprint calculation from the other end of the telescope, by combining household energy use with the behaviours and purchases of people living in particular areas, right down to individual community level.It therefore includes the impact of goods and services, many of which are imported, such as food, clothing and banking, but its focus on personal and household consumption excludes the emissions from some publicly-funded services like the NHS and other wider economic and financial factors.This research estimates Exeter’s carbon footprint at 770,000 tCO2e per annum but the emissions it excludes could represent as much as a third of the city’s total, meaning the true figure is likely to be more than a million tonnes each year.This conclusion is borne out by another, similar, consumption-based footprint calculator produced by the University of Oxford Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions in partnership with researchers at the University of Leeds and the University of Manchester.It also provides estimates at community level, relying on a range of data sources to calculate Exeter’s carbon footprint at just over 1,000,000tCO2e per annum.The DEFRA figures, which were the basis of the estimate we quoted in last year’s article examining the Net Zero Exeter plan, are for the whole UK so it is only possible to use them on a UK-wide per capita basis.They have since been updated, as have the ONS population estimates for Exeter. Recalculating the city’s footprint using the new DEFRA and ONS figures gives an annual emissions estimate of 1.4 million tCO2e for the city.Sources: BEIS, ONS, DEFRAHowever estimates derived from the DEFRA figures in this way probably represent the upper end of the range of carbon emissions estimates for Exeter because of the city’s relatively low levels of industrial activity.This means its per capita carbon footprint is likely to be lower than the UK average because other parts of the country have much higher levels of carbon-intensive industrialisation, although it also means that the scope for carbon capture and storage offsetting is limited here too.On the other hand the city sits at the centre of the second largest travel to work area in the country, with half of all those employed here commuting in each day, almost all by motor vehicle.Exeter-specific multi-regional economic input and output modelling would be necessary to decide where to allocate responsibility for the emissions generated by commuters who travel into the city to work, particularly as Exeter decision-makers are partly responsible for the economic geography that defines the region.While methodological differences in what is a developing research field mean we cannot simply rely on an off-the-shelf account of Exeter’s carbon emissions, what we can safely conclude is that a bespoke analysis of Exeter’s emissions which comprehensively addresses the city’s specific circumstances would conclude that its existing decarbonisation plan falls far short of its billing.South West strategic road network congestion. Photo by osde8info.However complex the challenge of clarifying the true scope and scale of Exeter’s carbon budget, once a “robust definition” has been agreed all else follows.Defining measurement methodologies, calculating baseline states, determining the annual reductions necessary to meet the city’s decarbonisation goals and creating reporting mechanisms to measure progress against those reductions all depend on that definition.Without taking these steps the city cannot hope to understand by how much and when it must reduce the emissions for which it is responsible, and it is only by taking them that the remaining questions around how to achieve those reductions can then be effectively addressed.As the University of Exeter’s organisational decarbonisation plan illustrates, such a framework should:  capture a comprehensive baseline of the city’s emissions across all sectors of activity and all emissions scopes  define necessary annual reduction targets for each of these sectors and scopes, including interim targets which minimally match government goals against specific dates  specify annual monitoring mechanisms which report performance against those targets.It should also include a parallel, separate account of the city’s annual offsetting capacity so no-one is in any doubt about the limited scope offsetting offers for addressing residual emissions.University of Exeter carbon tree. Source: University of Exeter.Despite Exeter City Council’s commitment to the so-called “Exeter Vision 2040”, in which it and its partners commit to being “recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”, it is clear that it does not have the answers to all of these problems.But it is also clear that the council still has a very limited understanding of what reducing Exeter’s carbon emissions to sustainable levels would actually involve.Instead of thinking of itself as “municipal entrepreneur, ring master and story teller” and trying to pass off the presence of significant climate science expertise in the city as a proxy for its claims about the Net Zero Exeter plan, it would do well to live up to its ostensible “analytical city” status by adopting an evidence-based carbon budget.

The embarrassment of climate science riches on its doorstep provides it with all the resources it could ever need to get to the bottom of its methodological options and create a new, improved decarbonisation plan for Exeter.Such a plan could present a truly ground-breaking local carbon budget, based on the facts of the matter, and a sophisticated policy-making framework in turn, complete with rigorous measurement and reporting methods to keep it on track.Instead of disguising the enormity of the challenge that confronts us for the sake of political expediency by relying on net zero rhetoric and partial, arbitrary targets that the city can neither measure nor meet, it could also grasp the fact that the principal route to preventing runaway climate change is actually cutting carbon emissions, rapidly and immediately.Then the city could legitimately claim some of the global leadership status to which its rhetoric tends but which the reality, sadly, currently does not.CORRECTIONThis story was updated on 12 November to reflect the fact that it was Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell who proposed the new risk register item to monitor the council’s ability to meet the 2030 decarbonisation target set for the city, not Liberal Democrat councillor Kevin Mitchell."

"content" : "Stagecoach drivers across Devon intend to go ahead with strike action on Monday following unsuccessful negotiations with the company for improved pay and working conditions.Transport union RMT has been fighting a national campaign for “pay justice” but says there is no alternative to industrial action as “an exodus” of bus workers is threatening vital services.Workforce shortages have already led to disruption across Devon, with service reductions and some temporary suspensions on less popular routes.RMT General Secretary Mike Lynch said: “It’s well established now that we are facing a national shortage of bus drivers as staff leave over poor pay and conditions”.He also said that the “RMT is fighting for professional wages for professional bus workers” who are underpaid, undervalued and often vulnerable.During the pandemic bus drivers continued to provide key services while working in close proximity to the public, putting their health at risk.RMT campaign sticker on Exeter bus shelterIndustry commentators have said that Brexit and the pandemic are the main drivers of staff shortages, both causing issues with recruitment and retention.Mike Watson, Managing Director at Stagecoach South West, said his firm is “committed to ensuring our people who keep our communities connected are properly rewarded, particularly after their contribution to the country over the past 18 months of the pandemic”.Earlier this week Stagecoach proposed a new pay package that it said would “deliver a near £1,000 increase in pay as well as other related improvements” and urged the RMT to support the offer.Today the union said strike action would still go ahead and claimed that Stagecoach has linked the pay offer with cuts to existing staff benefits.Related industrial action will also take place in the East Midlands, Derbyshire and Yorkshire. In Devon, services will be affected across the county.Those wishing to travel are advised to check the Stagecoach website for journey information.UPDATE: Stagecoach announced on 17 October that South West strike action has been called off. The RMT confirmed that industrial action has been suspended in order to allow members to vote on the latest offer from the company."

Please feel free to reply to this email or get in touch with any comments or suggestions you may have.TOP STORIESCITYPOINT POP-UPS REPRIEVEAn unplanned renaissance in Exeter city centre is being driven by short-lease tenants in repurposed retail units vacated as a result of the failed Princesshay II scheme.Revamped council plans for the area bounded by Paris Street, Sidwell Street, Cheeke Street and the old bus station nevertheless threaten the futures of artistic and cultural initiatives and independent local businesses that have spring up during a prolonged redevelopment hiatus.Council leader Phil Bialyk now says the council’s first priority is to build a new “civic hub” on the Bampfylde Street car park, and that it will be “some years” before anything happens on the rest of the site, whose tenants the council “would want” to accommodate “should they wish to remain”.Read more on our website or join the conversation on Twitter.WHEN IS A PBSA NOT A PBSA?Apparently when it’s the basis of an Exeter City Council planning decision to scrap the affordable housing requirement for the Clifton Hill sports centre redevelopment.Council-owned and financed developer Exeter City Living has cited an unpublished report which values the council-owned Clifton Hill site for student housing, despite a previous council decision ruling out this use, in seeking to overturn last year’s decision to require affordable housing there.Having received a council loan of nearly £16 million to buy and develop the site on the basis it would make a 20% profit, Exeter City Living now claims that the development is no longer financially viable if the affordable housing requirement remains.It nevertheless says that a government grant may be available to cover the cost of building the flats for social rent, a proviso which the council’s planning committee accepted at its Monday meeting despite its decision paving the way for other developers to dodge affordable housing provision.Read the full story or join the conversation on Twitter.GRETA TELLS IT LIKE IT ISAn interview with activist Greta Thunberg on the eve of the COP26 summit in which she calls on world leaders to be honest in confronting the climate crisis, published in partnership with Covering Climate Now.Since then it seems HM QE II has chimed in in support of Greta’s “all talk, no action” criticism.Read the interview here.IN CASE YOU MISSED IT“CHUMOCRACY” OVERSEEING THE CITYThe first of two stories following an Exeter Observer investigation of Liveable Exeter Place Board, the unelected and unaccountable body that meets in private, does not publish its discussions or decisions and is taking responsibility for major policies which will determine Exeter’s future.Normal practice for appointments to a body with a remit as significant as that of Liveable Exeter Place Board would be to advertise widely and make transparent choices on the basis of objective assessment of candidates. No such process applies to Liveable Exeter Place Board appointments, nor has it ever.Instead, board members are selected and appointed in secret, in a way that is redolent of the current Conservative government’s approach to appointments and procurement, despite Exeter City Council’s claim to be “committed to openness and transparency”.OUTSOURCED EXETER LOCAL GOVERNMENTThe second examines the board’s role, reach and potential impact. We have gathered evidence which shows that, notwithstanding Exeter City Council’s claims to the contrary, the board is a de facto decision-making and governance body which exercises public functions with the potential to affect everyone who lives and works in Exeter.NOTES &amp;amp; SKETCHESEXETER CITY COUNCIL SCRAPS OWN “UNACHIEVABLE” CARBON EMISSIONS TARGETIn an extraordinary reversal, the city council removed the goal of achieving carbon neutral operations by 2022 from its corporate risk register at a recent Audit &amp;amp; Governance committee meeting.The reason? Not only was the goal deemed “unachievable”, it seems the council hadn’t actually passed a resolution to achieve it in the first place.So what was it doing on the risk register, where it’s been since November 2019? It seems the council has been confusing energy policy with decarbonisation.Let’s hope the planned “net zero delivery team” won’t be prone to such schoolboy errors when it finally comes on stream in March next year.By then it will have been more than three years since the council declared a climate emergency: let’s hope the team comes equipped with a dictionary, too.MAY THE FORCE BE WITH UNESCOTorbay and Exeter’s joint UK city of culture bid, said to be inspired by the “closely connected coastal and city destinations” despite Brixham and Exeter being an hour and a half apart by public transport, didn’t make it onto the longlist of eight places which have caught the eye of culture vulture and escapee celebrity Nadine Dorries.Bested by Armagh, Bradford and Wrexham, among others, Exeter City Council nevertheless sees “many positives .. on which exciting plans can be implemented” coming out of the bid.LESS IS MOREThe University of Exeter published its long-awaited “Strategy 2030” at the beginning of the month. It’s a remarkable document, not least because of the Nobel-sized aspirations it expresses.Apparently the university plans to “lead meaningful action against the climate emergency and ecological crisis” while making “key breakthroughs” which will “transform human health and well-being”. It also hopes to “lead the progress towards creating a fair, socially just and inclusive society”.The scope and scale of its vision is commendable, but the document seems a little light on the detail of how it might achieve these Herculean tasks. Despite record high scores in the game of buzzword bingo, at just over 2,000 words it is only a little longer than this newsletter.

ON THE AGENDANEW EXETER LOCAL PLANThe first among several consultations to come on the new Exeter Local Plan continues until 15 November.Out for consideration and comment are an Issues consultation document (here with officer report here) and a new Statement of Community Involvement (document here and officer report here).The first outlines the key issues the new local plan is intended to address, and is presented alongside the “Exeter 2040 Vision” and “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme. The second outlines the ways in which the public, organisations and “other interested parties” are involved in city planning processes.Both will be amended following the consultation and brought back for approval by council members before being used as a basis on which a formal draft Exeter Local Plan will be produced next year.The new Local Development Scheme, which sets out the local plan preparation timetable, is here.ON OUR READING LISTBEYOND THE BIG SOCIETY?Michael Gove, recently reshuffled to a new post as communities secretary, has thrown his support behind a devolution model outlined in a pamphlet published by the New Local think tank in partnership with The New Social Covenant Unit.“Trusting the People: the case for community-powered conservatism”, by ten Conservative MPs from the 2019 intake, makes a case for “community power as the future of the party”.It claims to explore “how to level up the country” through what it calls a “double devolution to councils and communities” while calling for “businesses to act like citizens” via reform of the Companies Act and “an end to top-down funding decisions”.The report champions the “Wigan Deal”, which saved the borough council £115 million over ten years by encouraging residents to “take more responsibility” for public services themselves.While it’s not clear whether the Treasury will embrace the ideas contained in the report, the UK is among the most centralised mature democracies in the world, so there is plenty of interest here, not least because some of the pamphlet’s policies would look at home in the Labour manifesto.PDF here.HOUSING FOR PEOPLEMeanwhile, as Exeter’s housing crisis reaches fever pitch, think tank Localis weighs in with some timely ideas on planning for community need rather than developer profit.In the wake of the government’s controversial “Planning for the Future” white paper, it presents a case for a “stewarded model of land and housing delivery”.It emphasises state funding for affordable, mixed-tenure and sustainable housebuilding, community value charters intended to provide a transparent picture of how procurement around development benefits local economies, and more community engagement in design codes, protection of community assets and planning policy- and decision-making.The government is expected to announce its intentions for the delayed planning reform bill as part of the spending review which is due on 26 October.PDF hereHELP POWER EXETER OBSERVER’S PUBLIC INTEREST JOURNALISMThere are lots of ways you can help Exeter Observer to thrive:      Share this newsletter with your contacts and encourage them to subscribe.

"content" : "In July this year Exeter Observer reported on the successful opening of a new community arts project in the Sidwell Street building that used to contain clothing chain Peacocks, which we juxtaposed with the uncertainty presented by development plans which threaten the futures of all of the short-lease tenants in the area.Artists’ collective Maketank has transformed what was a three-storey furniture store building on Paris Street into a creative, rehearsal and performance space and The Sidwell Street Bakehouse trains volunteers in craft bread baking and sells high-quality loaves in what was a branch of Halfords.Independent retailers including houseplant specialist Hutch, the Cuckoo taproom and bottleshop and Kids Hub Coffee, a cafe with children’s play area, have also set up shop on Paris Street, where homeless charity St Petrock’s is opening a new pop-up hub tomorrow.This unplanned renaissance in the city’s East Gate area is being driven by short-lease tenants in the shadow of council plans to redevelop the area bounded by Paris Street, Sidwell Street, Cheeke Street and the old bus station that are known as the CityPoint scheme.2018 CityPoint development scheme drawingCityPoint was conceived as a response to the September 2017 failure of private/public sector plans for a new leisure complex, bus station and mixed retail and food development on the site extending down to the Western Way roundabout at the foot of Heavitree Road.The original scheme was presented as an extension of the existing Princesshay shopping centre across Paris Street, which was to be closed to motor traffic as part of the redevelopment.When The Crown Estate suddenly pulled out, citing unfavourable market conditions, the contractor which was expected to deliver the public sector works also declined to proceed.Exeter City Council found another contractor and continued with the leisure complex - now  St Sidwell’s Point - and the new bus station, financing both itself. The final bill for the work is awaited, but expected to be in excess of £52 million.In preparation for the demolition of the buildings on the south side of Sidwell Street and the east side of Paris Street, The Crown Estate, which owns the buildings, began terminating leases or offering short-term replacements. Several businesses decided to relocate.At the same time, ideas for the remainder of the original development site were commissioned from Jones Lang Lasalle, the firm which presented the controversial redevelopment proposals for Harlequins shopping centre last year.It proposed a mix of private sector build to rent and open market housing, a “civic hub” to which the council would relocate, offices and flexible workspaces, retail and food outlets and two hotels.Councillors approved the proposals in December 2018 as the basis for drawing up development plans.However progress since has been slow, with the hiatus prompting a range of independent local businesses, many with an artistic or cultural bent, to move into the vacant units, opting to trade low rents for the uncertainty of leases which can be terminated at short notice.  Paris Street &amp;amp; Sidwell Street tenants at October 2021                          Business type            Paris Street            Sidwell Street                                    Independent local            10            5                            Chain/franchise            0            7                            Charity            2            1                            Other            1            0                            Vacant units            1            3              Seven Paris Street and four Sidwell Street units are occupied by (broadly-defined) arts and culture organisations.The council was asked at a meeting in September to provide a progress report on the CityPoint development.Council leader Phil Bialyk said: “The Memorandum of Agreement with the principal landholders has been provisionally agreed. [It] provides for both a long term ownership structure of the site and for the joint promotion of opportunities as they arise.“This will enable the council and/or the principal landowners to select development partners or deliver elements of the scheme themselves.“We are currently in talks with both the Government Property Agency and the university regarding their joining with us to deliver the first phase of development, this being the Exeter Civic Hub, where the city council and public sector partners can create a vibrant city core, anchoring activity in the city centre and contributing to its continued resilience.”Indeed, the Liveable Exeter Place Board approved the development of a business case for a city centre “innovation district” for potential inclusion in the CityPoint redevelopment in March this year, although its decision has yet to appear on a city council meeting agenda.In July, when the council announced it had given financial support to Positive Light Projects, Amal Ghusain, lead councillor for culture and communities, said that the project “could be the spark for other artistic and cultural initiatives to follow and take root”.When asked for assurance that her statement would be factored into future site development planning, the council leader endorsed her ambition as “absolutely correct”.He also said that developing the civic hub on the open space beside the old bus station (the site of the Bampfylde Street car park) was the first priority, and that it would be “some years” before anything happened on the sites of the repurposed Paris Street and Sidwell Street retail units.Even more encouragingly, Councillor Bialyk said that the council “will want to work with whoever our partners are at the appropriate time to accommodate all those people who are currently there should they wish to remain. That is what we would want to do.”Exeter Civic Centre on Paris Street: Construction of a new civic hub would allow the council to vacate (and redevelop) its current officesCouncillor Bialyk’s cautious approach to further phases of the redevelopment may well be sensible, given the genesis of the proposals.First, the proposed scheme was presented to councillors in December 2018, before the coronavirus pandemic changed working and shopping patterns. What seemed viable then may be less so now, and still less in future.Second, the council will be aware of The Crown Estate’s past form in pulling out of a redevelopment project at the last minute, as it did in September 2017.Third, the site is within an nationally designated Area of Archaeological Importance. The designation aims to prevent important archaeological sites from being damaged or destroyed without at least allowing for some investigation and recording, which can cause delay and extra costs. The excavations for the new bus station confirmed that the area is rich in Roman remains.Finally, there is growing awareness of the carbon cost of demolition and redevelopment. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors calculated in 2017 that embodied emissions can constitute up to 75% of a building’s total carbon emissions over its lifespan, and the Architects’ Climate Action Network launched a campaign this year for embodied emissions to be regulated through changes to planning policy and building regulations.Since then the 2021 Pritzker Architecture Prize, the profession’s highest accolade, has been awarded to French architects Lacaton &amp;amp; Vassal, whose professional motto is: “Never demolish, never remove or replace, always add, transform and reuse”.Positive Light Projects photography studio under construction: Converting space to new uses need not be difficult or expensiveWe asked both the council and The Crown Estate if they would consider site redevelopment options which involved retaining the existing buildings.The council said there was nothing to add to Councillor Bialyk’s September statement.The Crown Estate said: “As owners of Princesshay, we want to ensure Exeter is a welcoming and exciting place to live and visit. We continue to work closely with the council on how we can enhance our offer at Princesshay, and the surrounding area, and ways we can work with those in the community to help meet local needs.”Neither the council nor The Crown Estate has so far made an explicit commitment to demolition, so – at least hypothetically – the option of refurbishing the existing buildings remains open.Such an approach is demonstrably achievable. As Positive Light Projects has shown, it is perfectly possible to transform vacated East Gate buildings into a range of spaces with flexible uses over several floors, and to do so at low cost (albeit with plenty of volunteer labour).The design of many of the existing buildings, particularly in Paris Street, makes them already fit for this purpose.And while the existing Paris Street and Sidwell Street frontages may not conform with the council’s vision of brand new architect-designed glass-fronted monoliths, a series of modest improvements to their facades, as well as their surroundings, could well create the “liveable” environment the council is so keen to promote.The west end of Sidwell Street has few trees: Denser planting could transform public realm by softening architectural impactsThese improvements could include planting many more trees on what are broad pavements - and even down the middle of both roads to create two carriageways, making superficial external changes to building facades - employing new surfaces and colour schemes, and enforcing existing motor traffic regulations - in particular to ensure the west end of Sidwell Street is used only by buses and taxis.These are among many options in routine use in other towns and cities around the country.The council could do worse than engage the city’s creative and artistic communities, many of which are driving the East Gate area renaissance, to help it develop ideas for what would be low cost, low carbon interventions to help Paris Street and Sidwell Street grow.Then the council could deliver its leader’s vision without needing the enormous capital investment that will otherwise be required to demolish and replace the existing buildings with a wall of concrete, glass and steel."

"content" : "For climate activist Greta Thunberg, success at the upcoming U.N. climate conference would come only if world leaders honestly admit that their action is not living up to their words.The summit, taking place next month in Glasgow, aims to secure pledges by the world’s nations to limit the global temperature from rising more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average.“We are so, so far behind what would be needed,” the 18-year-old told Reuters in an interview at the kitchen table of her two-bedroom Stockholm apartment on Wednesday evening, after returning home from school.“Maybe leaders being honest will create a sense of urgency that will make people wake up.”Greta Thunberg outside the Swedish parliament building in August 2018 Photo: Anders Hellberg under a Creative Commons licenseIn just three years since she started skipping school on Fridays to protest alone outside the Swedish parliament, Thunberg has become a global figure, giving voice to her generation’s fury at the world’s failure to tackle a problem known about for decades.Next month’s COP26 summit is billed as the last big chance for leaders to announce firm targets to cut climate-warming industrial emissions this decade. Thunberg says she will probably go to the conference but expects to be disappointed once again.She said: “My expectation is that we will hear many, many nice speeches, we will hear many pledges that - if you really look into the details - are more or less meaningless, but they just say them in order to have something to say, in order for media to have something to report about.“And then I expect things to continue to remain the same. The COPs as they are now will not lead to anything unless there is big, massive pressure from the outside.”With global temperatures having already risen by 1.1°C, and a UN climate panel warning that climate change is close to spinning out mediaof control, Thunberg discussed the upcoming summit in interviews with Reuters, NBC News and The Nation, co-ordinated through Covering Climate Now, a global media partnership of which Exeter Observer is a member.Greta Thunberg outside the Berlin Reichstag in September 2021 Photo: Stefan Müller under a Creative Commons licenseOver the last three years, millions of young people have joined Thunberg’s Fridays for Future movement, skipping school to protest for action against climate change.Her forthright speeches have put world leaders on notice: “You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal”, she said in a speech at a UN summit in 2019. “The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.”After a year out of class promoting her cause full time, Thunberg is now a student once more, enrolled in her second year of high school.She has moved from her parents’ home into her first apartment, a borrowed one, shared with a labrador named Roxy and a golden retriever called Moses. Her father, Svante, visits often. Her younger sister and opera-singing mother Malena Ernman are performing these days in Stockholm in a musical about Edith Piaf.“When you stay grounded, it’s not so hard to come back to normal life again”, said Thunberg. “And I am fortunately in Sweden, where people don’t care so much about famous people. So I’ve been left alone.”The forthrightness which brought her to global attention is still her trademark. Before the interview, she said her autism - a diagnosis she has referred to in the past as a “superpower” - made her more comfortable looking directly into the camera than towards an interviewer.Greta Thunberg: “Democracy is the only solution to the climate crisis”Last month, she mocked world leaders in a speech to youth activists in Milan, saying: “Build back better, blah blah blah, green economy, blah blah blah, net zero by 2050, blah blah blah, climate neutral, blah blah blah.”“This is all we hear from our so-called leaders. Words. Words that sound great, but so far has led to no action.”Now, she says she is trying to manage her work with Fridays For Future with her regular school workload. Because of the pandemic, the movement meets mostly online, making it less time consuming.“I’m trying to be efficient: to do all the homework while I am at school, so that when I go home, I am free to do other things, to work”, she said. “Surprisingly, I manage.”She has few plans for when she finishes high school in two years, but said she wanted to continue studying “because I like doing that.”And after school? “I’m sort of procrastinating that. But I guess we’ll see where I end up.”This story originally appeared on Reuters and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration committed to strengthening coverage of the climate story.The interview with Greta Thunberg was conducted by Covering Climate Now partners NBC News, Reuters and The Nation."

"content" : "Exeter City Council is planning to reverse its decision to require affordable housing as part of the redevelopment of the Clifton Hill sports centre site in Newtown.Council-owned developer Exeter City Living has challenged last year’s council planning committee decision to require the inclusion of eleven flats for social rent as part of a luxury enclave of high specification four- and five-bedroom homes to be built on council-owned land alongside an area of the city which is among the most deprived places in the country.Its challenge is based on an unpublished viability assessment which values the site for development as student accommodation despite council leaders repeatedly ruling out this use and the city council passing a resolution in January 2020 to exclude this possibility.Exeter City Living, which received a council loan of nearly £16 million last year to buy and develop the site on the basis it would make a 20% profit, and has since also received a £425,000 government grant for the project, now claims that the development is no longer financially viable if the affordable housing requirement remains.It says that if the council removes this requirement a government grant may be available to cover the cost of building the flats for social rent, but does not say that it will receive the money.If the city council planning committee agrees to scrap the affordable housing requirement at its meeting on Monday, other developers will be able to cite its decision as a material consideration in future planning decisions when they seek to avoid affordable housing requirements.There is no opportunity for public comment on the plan, which the council only published on Monday this week and which is being presented as a fait accompli.We asked the council questions about the plan on Tuesday, requesting responses by this morning as the decision will be taken next Monday. It said it was not able to answer them in the timeframe provided, despite itself being responsible for limiting notice of the decision to a single week.The council also provided a statement which was sent earlier this week to concerned ward councillors, who had been kept in the dark about the plan. The statement addressed none of the issues we raised.Clifton Hill sport centre has been closed since March 2018 after suffering weather damageAn unpublished viability assessment is at the centre of Exeter City Living’s claim that it can no longer develop the site on the basis it previously agreed with the council.This secrecy is normally justified on the grounds that such assessments contain commercially sensitive information, but for a council-owned and financed company to rely on a tactic that is partly responsible for the poor public perception of many private sector property developers is unusual, to say the least.Members of the planning committee are in the same position as the public: neither are entitled to see it. The detail it contains, on which the council planning officer’s recommendation that the committee approve this decision is based, is not available for scrutiny.However it is normal practice for planning officers to summarise viability assessment findings, as well as those of an independent evaluation of the findings that is also required, to enable planning committee members to make better-informed decisions.No such summary has been provided in this case. We asked the council why not, but it did not answer. We also asked it why no opportunity for public consultation on this decision has been provided. Again, no answer.The planning officer’s report does, however, say that the viability assessment demonstrates that Exeter City Living’s previously-agreed proposals are no longer financially viable when “an alternative use of the site as purpose built student accommodation”, which would dramatically increase the value of the land, is taken into account.It also says that the independent evaluation of the viability assessment agrees, concluding that Exeter City Living would not be able to deliver affordable housing as part of the development if Exeter City Council agrees that purpose built student accommodation could create this elevated “alternate use value” for the land.This is one of four government-specified tests which viability assessments must pass: they must demonstrate that “the alternative use could be implemented on the site in question”. If so, the viability of development can be assessed on the basis of the land value for that alternative use.The city council planning officer concluded that all four tests had been met and that the Clifton Hill sports centre site should therefore be valued, not for development as residential housing, but for development as purpose built student accommodation, making the previously-agreed proposals no longer financially viable.What he did not say was that, having bought the land for a song, Exeter City Living now wanted the council to behave as if it had paid full whack.The proposed development will take place largely on the brownfield areas of the site …It is not clear on what basis the council thinks student accommodation could be built on the Clifton Hill site when it has repeatedly ruled out this use. When the decision was taken in January 2019 to demolish the sports centre and build housing instead, the council’s scrutiny committee, its Executive and a meeting of the full council itself all unambiguously resolved not to allow the development of student accommodation there.The council resolution was to “delegate authority to the city surveyor to take the necessary steps to ensure the Clifton Hill land is not used for purpose built student accommodation”. Pete Edwards, then council leader, said the “voluntary condition of sale had been imposed to benefit the economic, social and environmental well-being of the community”.The decision was publicised by the city council’s press office, ward member Richard Branston (who is a member of the planning committee) said that all the Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s ward councillors supported the decision, and the local Labour party promoted it on its campaign leaflets.In July that year Phil Bialyk, who had by then taken over as council leader, said: “I’ve made a commitment, and my party has made a commitment, not to build student houses on that site”.In January 2020, when the city council approved a loan of £15,643,478 to Exeter City Living to allow it to buy and develop the land, Phil Bialyk reinforced the message, saying Exeter City Living, as a council-owned development company, would ensure that the housing mix delivered on the Clifton Hill site would accord with council requirements.In fact this loan was explicitly agreed on the basis that the Clifton Hill site was valued for residential housing and not student accommodation, an alternative use of the site which the council knew, and said, at the time would increase the site value by “in excess of £2 million”.The decision not to sell the land on the open market for the highest price, which would have meant development for student accommodation, required the Secretary of State’s approval because of the size of the under-valuation.The loan was also explicitly granted on the basis that the development would make a 20% profit. Exeter City Living now says that rising land values and Brexit-related labour and supply chain cost increases, among other things, have increased development costs so much that its proposals would no longer make enough money to satisfy government guidance on profit margins, although this is only so if the land value is increased to the levels a student accommodation developer would pay.However rising land values and post-Brexit shortages, particularly in the construction sector, which were all widely predicted long before the council’s loan decision, should have come as no surprise to either the council or its property development company.Every property developer, and every local authority that owns a property development company, has to factor these issues into their decisions, and most have managed to do so since the EU referendum, which took place three and half years before the council gave its company a green light at Clifton Hill, without reaching for viability assessments based on alternative land uses that have already been ruled out.… but will also consume green space and entail the removal of a range of treesWe asked the council whether the city surveyor did, in fact, take the necessary steps to ensure the Clifton Hill land is not used for student accommodation, and what those steps were. We asked it on what basis the viability assessment, and the independent report on the viability assessment, consider that the alternative use of the site as student accommodation is possible.We asked on what basis the council thinks the Clifton Hill site could be used to build student accommodation, so allowing the alternate use and consequent increase in land value claimed in the viability assessment, and on what basis the council accepts that assessment.We asked whether the Secretary of State had approved the lower site valuation based on the council ruling out student accommodation on the site, and we asked whether the Secretary of State’s decision had any bearing on the subsequent viability assessment.We also asked the council why it had not considered the possibility that a developer would seek to reduce or remove the affordable housing requirement by using a viability assessment in this way (a frequently-used tactic in the sector) when any of the relevant decisions concerning the site were made. And we asked whether its decision to rule out student development on the site was, in fact, relevant at all.It answered none of these questions. Nor did it explain what, apart from predictable development cost increases and some minor material changes in circumstances identified in the planning case officer’s report, had caused the expected development costs to rise so much that the 20% profit margin on which Exeter City Living’s £16 million loan had been based had evaporated.We were also left wondering whether the council’s political leadership has been kept in the loop. Just four months ago, when asked about progress on the development at a scrutiny committee meeting, council leader Phil Bialyk, who said he was having regular discussions with Exeter City Living’s directors, did not mention that their plans for the Clifton Hill site might no longer be financially viable.Clifton Hill sport centre has deteriorated since its closureExeter City Council has end to end control over the redevelopment of the Clifton Hill sports centre site. It owns the land and the development company and has directly financed the development with public money. It is also the local planning authority, with control over both planning policy and individual planning decisions.Whether the council or the company is responsible for the failure to foresee the rising land values and post-Brexit shortages that have led to the company asking the council to disapply its affordable housing policy, the consequences of doing so could be far-reaching.The affordable housing provision agreed last December was already a perversion of the council’s policies. It was presented as 26% of the development (eleven of 42 dwellings) and deemed acceptable as the developer could claim vacant building credit to reduce the affordable housing it would otherwise have to supply by the size of the demolished sports centre.But the eleven affordable units were small flats, and the remaining 31 units large houses, so when the proposed development was measured by floor area the affordable units represented less than 13% of the total. The council’s policy is for 35% of total housing provision to be affordable.And now the company wants the council to scrap the affordable housing requirement altogether, leaving the door open for developers to cite the decision as a material consideration in future planning applications in the city when they want to avoid affordable housing requirements too.The Clifton Hill development will include 45 car parking spaces despite being less than five minutes’ walk from the city centre …When planning permission for the Clifton Hill development was granted at the end of last year, councillors queued up to praise the development’s affordable housing provision.One welcomed the “principle of the development focussing on high quality, affordable homes and not seeking to maximise profit”, while another said “this superb development […] will enhance the community and will provide sorely needed social housing and affordable homes for the community”.A third said “the people lucky enough to live in the houses will bring a lot to the area” and council leader Phil Bialyk called it “a major boost to the community”.Which community? The council is building a luxury enclave of high specification four- and five-bedroom homes alongside an area of the city which is among the most deprived in the country.The expected purchase price of the houses has not been provided, although it will be included in the unpublished viability assessment. If we look at similar houses as a guide, as depicted in an Exeter City Living consultation document for the development, such as those on Marmalade Lane in Cambridge, we might expect the Clifton Hill houses to be priced at around £700,000 each if they were on sale today.How many local residents will be able to afford to live in these houses? We should probably look further afield for their future owners. Not long after planning permission was granted, Exeter City Council enthusiastically promoted a Guardian story subtitled: “Winchester, Exeter and York are new property hotspots for those fleeing the capital after lockdown in search of space”.As independent city councillor Jemima Moore, who was elected by a landslide in 2019 on the back of public opposition to the council’s plans for the Clifton Hill site, said at the planning committee meeting that granted permission for the development last year: “This is not an application coming from a private developer to develop private land. This is a development on public land and this is Exeter City Council’s very own development delivery company, a company which should be setting the bar, showing the expected standard for developments in our city.“We should be able to expect something excellent and yet we have a proposal that does not accord fully with our own policies. It doesn’t meet the very standards that we expect other developers to abide by. It will provide much needed residential homes but homes which are out of the reach of most of those who live in Newtown on a space which previously belonged to all of us.”… with three public car parks within the same radiusIt appears that Exeter City Living would like the members of the council planning committee to take it on trust that, despite everything, it will nevertheless deliver the affordable housing planned for the site via a Homes England grant. This may be what happens, although the council admits that it also may not.The statement issued to ward councillors says, in the passive voice, that “it is insisted that affordable council housing is to be provided and this will be honoured”. It adds: “The council can potentially benefit from [a] Homes England grant”.The city council’s planning officer appears satisfied that Exeter City Living “has indicated to officers [its] intention to seek third party funding to deliver affordable housing”.Do these reassurances provide a sufficiently substantial basis for the city council’s planning committee members to remove the current affordable housing requirement for the site?We asked the council why the planning committee is being asked to do so before Exeter City Living secures funding to provide the needed housing by another means, and why the planning officer’s recommendation is not that its decision should be contingent on Exeter City Living securing the grant funding it seeks first.We asked whether the development would proceed without any affordable housing provision if Exeter City Living cannot secure grant funding, and how the eleven social rented homes for the over 60’s that were identified as a specific need in the area during public consultation would otherwise be provided.We also asked whether the council would recommend such a decision if the applicant were not a council-owned company. No answers were provided.Exeter Labour Party has property interests alongside the development siteWhen the council planning committee considered Exeter City Living’s planning application last year it did so on the basis of the application as a whole, balancing numerous relevant considerations against one another. It is now being invited to rescind a single, major element of its decision in isolation.This is similar to the tactic employed at the Harlequins shopping centre. Having secured planning permission on the basis it will build a hotel on the site, the developer has since submitted a revised application to return to an earlier, rejected, vision which will replace the hotel with a second co-living block.The planning committee is also being asked to make Monday’s decision in haste, the same way as earlier decisions about the site were taken. This often leads to ill-informed decisions and increases the risk of the council making a mistake.

Is Homes England really insisting that Exeter City Council rescinds last year’s decision to require affordable housing on the Clifton Hill site before it will consider funding affordable housing there itself, as the statement issued to ward councillors implies? Why would it do so given the likelihood that such a decision will undermine the city’s ability to enforce its affordable housing policy in future?One answer would be that Homes England is a stakeholder, and expected to be a shareholder, in the Exeter City Fund property development vehicle that is approaching Exeter like a speeding juggernaut and would like the road ahead cleared of planning policy that might obstruct its progress.Exeter City Council’s most significant powers are as the city’s planning authority. If what is happening at Clifton Hill is a guide to its intent when it has complete control over every aspect of the development process, we should expect the property development bonanza that is coming under the Liveable Exeter banner to deliver more of the same.We should also expect other developers to follow the way Exeter City Council-owned Exeter City Living is paving for them, by seeking to use viability assessments to evade affordable housing provision and by returning with revised applications to get the parts of planning decisions they don’t like overturned after the fact."

It also hopes to “lead the progress towards creating a fair, socially just and inclusive society”.The scope and scale of its vision is commendable, but the document seems a little light on the detail of how it might achieve these Herculean tasks.

Not only was the goal deemed “unachievable”, it seems the council hadn’t actually passed a resolution to achieve it in the first place.So what was it doing on the risk register, where it’s been since November 2019? It seems the council has been confusing energy policy with decarbonisation.Let’s hope the planned “net zero delivery team” won’t be prone to such schoolboy errors when it finally comes on stream in March next year.By then it will have been more than three years since the council declared a climate emergency: let’s hope the team comes equipped with a dictionary, too."

"content" : "Initial proposals for changes to parliamentary constituency boundaries which will come into force in late 2023, and so are likely to affect the next general election, are currently out for consultation.Changes intended to make Parliament more representative by reducing variations in voter numbers between seats will reduce the Exeter constituency’s complement and entail moving its current boundary westwards.At the moment all Exeter City Council’s electoral wards form the parliamentary constituency except parts of Priory, St Loye’s and Topsham. These are divided by the current parliamentary boundary, although few people live in the section of Priory that is over the border, much of which consists of Ludwell Valley Park.The proposed changes would involve moving the remainder of these three wards out of Exeter. This would avoid the current ward split and reduce the Exeter constituency electorate of 80,676 to 71,713, firmly into the desired range.Another 11,512 Exeter electors already live in the East Devon constituency.The Ordnance Survey’s election maps site shows the current arrangements in detail.The proposed changes would mean that the Exeter parliamentary constituency would lose the lion’s share of Priory ward, which the Labour Party dominates in local elections.Exeter City Council’s July Executive meeting instead decided to put an alternative proposal to the boundary commission.The committee report relied on the same number of voters residing in Priory and Pinhoe, somewhat simplifying the situation, to present the possibility of keeping Priory and jettisoning Pinhoe instead.Arguments in favour included concern about which constituency would end up with the RD&amp;amp;E hospital, which is apparently in the “urban heart of the city” despite being located in leafy Wonford, but Pinhoe’s history as a two-way Labour-Conservative marginal did not feature among them.Nor did the committee focus on the feelings of the residents of the rump of St Loye’s, not all of whom would necessarily celebrate being moved to a safe Conservative seat.The consultation on the initial boundary change proposals closes on Monday, but there’s no need to panic if you’re not familiar with the city’s psephology: a second consultation with public hearings is planned for early 2022."

"content" : "Welcome to The Exeter Digest, Exeter Observer’s essential free email newsletter. Thanks for subscribing. Please feel free to reply to this email or get in touch with any comments or suggestions you may have.LIVEABLE EXETER PLACE BOARD DOUBLE BILLBoth top stories in this edition of The Exeter Digest follow an Exeter Observer investigation of Liveable Exeter Place Board, the unelected and unaccountable body that meets in private, does not publish its discussions or decisions and is taking responsibility for major policies which will determine Exeter’s future.“CHUMOCRACY” OVERSEES THE CITYThe first focusses on the secretive, informal way in which board members are selected and appointed. Freedom of information requests have revealed a “chumocracy” redolent of the current Conservative government’s approach to appointments and procurement despite Exeter City Council’s claim to be “committed to openness and transparency”.Read more on our website or join the conversation on Twitter.OUTSOURCED EXETER LOCAL GOVERNMENTThe second examines the board’s role, reach and potential impact. We have gathered evidence which shows that, notwithstanding Exeter City Council’s claims to the contrary, the board is a de facto decision-making and governance body which exercises public functions with the potential to affect everyone who lives and works in Exeter.Read the full story or join the conversation on Twitter.IN CASE YOU MISSED ITHARLEQUINS DEVELOPER PLANS SECOND “CO-LIVING” BLOCK INSTEAD OF HOTELExeter City Council approved plans to redevelop Harlequins shopping centre last year despite vehement opposition from residents, campaigners and conservation charities.Since receiving formal consent for the scheme the developer has submitted a revised application to return to an earlier, rejected, vision for the site which will replace the planned hotel with a second “co-living” block.A revised economic impact assessment now discounts the scheme’s claimed benefits and observers remain convinced the co-living blocks are student accommodation in all but name.COMMUNITY ARTS CENTRE DESPITE CITYPOINT REDEVELOPMENT THREATParts of Exeter city centre are experiencing an unplanned renaissance as small shops and cultural venues fill empty units on Paris Street and Sidwell Street, but the council still intends to demolish and redevelop the area, with outline plans framed around massive build to rent blocks, hotels, offices and a brand new civic centre for itself.Positive Light Projects has nevertheless transformed a disused building on Sidwell Street into artist studios, gallery space, a photography studio, offices and meeting space for local groups.NOTES &amp;amp; SKETCHESSOUND FAMILIAR?A Centre for Governance and Scrutiny report into Nottingham City Council’s “superficial and inadequate” scrutiny mechanisms has been published following a public interest report by auditor Grant Thornton which accused the council of “institutional blindness” over poor financial decision-making which led to it borrowing £35 million from the government to avoid collapse.The CfGS report (item five) places some of the blame on a political culture where any public challenge is seen as “disloyalty”.IT’S GRIM DOWN SOUTH WEST …Recent synthesis of economic data by Devon County Council makes for gloomy reading. Before the pandemic began 39% of children across the county were part of working families claiming tax credits (3% higher than the national average) with even more in some areas (43% in North Devon and 44% in Torridge), while average pay for the lowest 20% of earners fell between 2019 and 2020, a period during which it rose nationally.Exeter fared worst among Devon districts, with a 14% fall, at the same time as house prices rose by 18% and rents increased by more than twice as much as in the rest of the country.As the pandemic has eased, the county has continued to struggle, with high housing costs, low wages and the “staycation” boom prompting landlords to cash in on short term lets among factors causing significant local labour shortages. Meanwhile high street vacancy rates remain above the national average in many areas, including Exeter city centre.… BUT WE’RE ALL IN IT TOGETHERLast Friday the UN released a report assessing the combined climate action plans of all 191 parties to the Paris Agreement which found that they point towards a catastrophic 2.7°C temperature rise by the end of the century.Not only that. Instead of a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2010 levels by 2030, necessary to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C according to the IPCC sixth assessment report published last month, current Paris Agreement signatory plans put us on course for a 16% increase by that date.Meanwhile, back in post-Brexit blighty, an analysis of how UK broadcasters are exposing audiences to climate change found that the word “cake” was used ten times more often than the phrase “climate change” on UK TV in 2020.NO JOKEOur thanks to a reader of Exeter Digest #5, who pointed out that use of the toilets included in Exeter’s new, apparently “state of the art” bus station, is not free of charge. He told us he found that users have to spend more than a penny whichever way they pay.

ON THE AGENDANEW EXETER LOCAL PLANExeter City Council began the process of lining up its spatial development aspiration ducks this week by opening the first of several consultations on the new Exeter Local Plan. We are asked to consider and comment on an Issues consultation document ( here with officer report here) and a new Statement of Community Involvement (document here and officer report here).The first outlines the key issues the new local plan is intended to address, and is presented alongside the “Exeter 2040 Vision” and “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme. The second outlines the ways in which the public, organisations and “other interested parties” are involved in city planning processes.Both will be amended following the consultation and brought back for approval by council members before being used as a basis on which a formal draft Exeter Local Plan will be produced next year.The current consultation runs until 15 November, and includes two public exhibitions: Thursday 30 September at Exeter Central Library and Wednesday 13 October at the Guildhall, both 1-7pm. Hard copies of the consultation documents can also be viewed during opening hours at the Civic Centre on Paris Street and at Exeter Central Library.The new Local Development Scheme, which sets out the local plan preparation timetable is here.HEAVITREE &amp;amp; WHIPTON LOW TRAFFIC NEIGHBOURHOODThe second phase of public consultation on Devon County Council’s plans to reduce traffic volumes in Heavitree and Whipton (although not, of course, on the arterial routes which run through them). The first phase, which informed the options on offer in phase two, took place at the end of last year: a response summary is available here.The current survey can be completed online until 7 October. “Measures which receive the most public support are expected to form part of a trial later this year.”QUEEN STREET &amp;amp; IRON BRIDGE ROAD LAYOUT CHANGESAnother county highways consultation, this one on making permanent the temporary traffic restriction changes on Queen Street and Iron Bridge that were introduced earlier this year. Respondents are asked to comment on three options as well as make additional suggestions.The online survey closes on 13 October. “If a permanent change were supported, Traffic Regulation Orders would then need to be advertised and consulted on, with a final decision on progressing any permanent change to be made by elected councillors at a future committee meeting.”LABOUR UNLIMITEDThanks also to another reader, who sent us a local Labour party leaflet which was delivered through their door complete with some rather surprising claims. One in particular stood out. Under the heading: “Across Exeter your Labour councillors have achieved” it said: “Reaching net zero carbon by 2030”.Unless a casual slice of grammar butchery, or an act of radical historical revisionism, it must surely mark a new peak in heroic Exeter Labour confidence, presenting the city’s future as a fait accompli. Perhaps the planned “innovation district” has got off to a flying start by producing a Team Labour time machine?ON OUR READING LISTCCN GOES COP26A report published last week by the County Council Network (which represents county and unitary authorities in England) unsurprisingly concluded that the government has been too city-focused in its climate action to date and must provide more funding and support to reduce emissions in county areas.OPPORTUNITY KNOCKSThe Social Market Foundation published related research two days before, ranking the impact of the prospective net zero transition across local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales in the form of an opportunity/risk index.As assessment criteria included proximity to the nearest decarbonising industrial cluster Exeter came in at a less than world-class 168th position (out of 363 local authorities surveyed).The Midlands, North West, Wales and the North East all ranked highly, reflecting the opportunities when both problems and potential problem solvers are in the same place.

"content" : "Last week Exeter Observer published the latest instalment in a series scrutinising the Liveable Exeter Place Board, an unelected and unaccountable body that meets in private, does not publish its discussions or decisions and is taking responsibility for major policies which will determine the city’s future.It examined the secretive and informal way in which the board’s members are selected and appointed, in contrast with other local public bodies, and exposed similarities with the current Conservative government’s approach to appointments and procurement, the much-criticised “chumocracy”.Despite Exeter City Council’s failure to respond to freedom of information requests about the activities of Liveable Exeter Place Board, which we continue to challenge, we have gathered evidence which shows that the board is a de facto decision-making and governance body which exercises public functions with the potential to affect everyone who lives and works in Exeter.Liveable Exeter Place Board agenda October 2020 (redacted by information request responder)The board’s extraordinary reach is reflected in its extensive terms of reference. These were drafted in secret and enacted months before being presented to the council as a fait accompli.In July 2019 the council’s Executive committee agreed the following recommendation, which was adopted without discussion at a full council meeting two weeks later:“Council approve[s] the establishment of a board to oversee the Liveable Exeter Garden City programme, the proposed composition of the board and the draft terms of reference be delegated to the CE&amp;amp;GD [Chief Executive &amp;amp; Growth Director] in consultation with the Leader of the Council and be reported back to a future meeting of Executive.”Eleven months then passed without the presentation of a report on the board’s membership or its terms of reference.The board had already met seven times when St David’s councillor Diana Moore asked about the missing report at an Executive meeting in June 2020. Council leader Phil Bialyk said: “The original draft terms of reference agreed by Council have not been amended in any meaningful way. Hence we have not reported back to Executive”.His response neither addressed the issue of the board’s membership nor the fact that the Council had never agreed its terms of reference.However the board then did change its terms of reference, at its meeting the following month, when it decided to take over governance of the Exeter &amp;amp; Cranbrook Sport England local delivery pilot. The paper proposing this change was dated the same day as the meeting at which the council leader had said no changes had been made.The proposal to replace the original Sport England programme board with the Liveable Exeter Place Board described the latter as “the driving force behind the recovery process for the city”. It said: “Liveable Exeter Place Board … defines what needs to be done … has overall responsibility and determines policy, strategy, parameters and resource requirements. It maintains a common purpose, assesses options and evaluates progress.”This decision was not reported to the city council’s Executive until September 2020, two months later, when the Executive was also presented, for the first time, with the board’s (by then extended) membership.By this time the board had met on nine occasions and discussed a wide range of topics, including Exeter Vision 2040, which forms part of the city council’s corporate plan, the Liveable Exeter property development scheme for 12,000 new dwellings in the city, Devon County Council’s Exeter Transport Strategy 2020-30, the COVID-19 test and trace programme and the redevelopment plans for CityPoint (aka East Gate), Marsh Barton industrial estate and the area around St David’s station.

At subsequent meetings the board discussed the Exeter City Fund (a plan to sell hundreds of millions of pounds’ worth of public sector assets to finance the Liveable Exeter property development scheme), the Arts Council England Cultural Compact and Exeter City of Literature, a “potential opportunity to deliver enhanced recreational and natural opportunities along the Exe Estuary” and the delivery of the Net Zero Exeter plan by Exeter City Futures.In March this year it approved the development of a business case for an Exeter city centre “innovation district” intended to help promote the CityPoint redevelopment, which will involve the demolition of the remaining buildings on Paris Street and Sidwell Street beside the bus station and leisure centre. This decision has yet to appear on a city council meeting agenda.The board has even discussed how to respond to difficult questions about its membership, role and remit from Exeter Observer, as well as how to deal with press enquiries in future. The plan was for the city council to release a “brief, high-level statement” after each board meeting from December 2020 onwards, however only one such statement has since been published.It said that the meeting included remarks by the chair and a presentation on the city’s cultural strategy but says nothing about the meeting’s six other substantive items of business.CityPoint redevelopment scheme drawingPerhaps most significantly of all, the board also oversaw the development of the city’s “Building Exeter Back Better” pandemic recovery plan.In June 2020, the city council’s Executive was presented with an initial draft of this plan, which ran to just over two pages in length.The council leader, Phil Bialyk, said that “all members would be fully informed via Executive and Council through further reports and that there remained appropriate mechanisms for the plan to be considered through the council’s scrutiny process.”A completed draft of this plan was ready for discussion by the time the board met in October 2020. The covering email which was sent to board members with the meeting agenda and papers beforehand included a request “not to share the draft recovery plan beyond yourselves at this time and until the board has had the opportunity to review and endorse the document.”The board approved the plan in principle, but also asked the project director, who is an Exeter City Council employee, to make some amendments, particularly to the “scale” of the plan’s spending priorities. The project director agreed to review these details “prior to presentation to ECC’s Executive”.By the time the plan was presented to the council’s Executive, in November 2020, a month after the Liveable Exeter Place Board meeting which had approved it, it was 80 pages long and outlined more than £500 million in spending priorities.No interim reports had been presented to city council members via Executive or Council, and at no point had the plan been considered through the council’s “scrutiny process”.Liveable Exeter Place Board minutes December 2020 (redacted by information request responder)The report accompanying the pandemic recovery plan said the Liveable Exeter Place Board had “endorsed” and “adopted” it, and its development had been “co-ordinated by council officers, with input from other key city stakeholders.”In fact just four city council officers had been tasked with co-ordinating seven working groups, each of which was chaired by a Liveable Exeter Place Board member, with input from just under 100 stakeholders in all.It did not explain why the board had, in effect, signed off on the plan (complete with requested amendments) before its presentation to the council’s Executive for approval.Throughout the plan development process the city council used words such as “endorsed”, “adopted” and “co-ordinated” in this context. Earlier this year it described the board as having “shaped” Exeter’s recovery plan.However it sometimes fails to filter out what amount to Freudian slips in its statements about the board’s true status.In June last year it said that council officers were “leading the work on the recovery plan” then, a week later, that the plan’s development was being “led by the Liveable Exeter Place Board”.Both these things cannot be true at the same time, in the same way as the city council cannot be taking decisions that the Liveable Exeter Place Board has already made.  Liveable Exeter Place Board agenda items  Liveable Exeter Place Board has dealt with the following topics since its first meeting in December 2019, several of which it has addressed on more than one occasion:      Exeter Vision 2040    Liveable Exeter property development scheme    Exeter &amp;amp; Cranbrook Sport England local delivery pilot    Exeter Live Better/Liveable Exeter branding    FlyBe    Devon County Council Exeter Transport Strategy 2020-30    Sandy Park Hotel &amp;amp; Sandy Gate traffic/transport    Arts Council England Cultural Compact    UNESCO City of Literature funding award    COVID-19 test and trace    Devon County Council electric bus funding bid    St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre    Building Exeter Back Better city pandemic recovery plan    CityPoint (aka East Gate) redevelopment    Marsh Barton redevelopment    South West Venture Capital Fund    Reframing the Cultural Landscape options analysis    Exeter City Fund (aka Exeter Development Fund)    MHCLG White Paper on planning reform    Exeter Chamber return to workplace survey    HotSW LEP recovery work &amp;amp; the levelling up agenda    Whimple passing loop &amp;amp; the levelling up agenda    DEFRA Agriculture Act &amp;amp; Environmental Land Management Scheme    MHCLG New Development Corporation competition    Exeter Innovation District    St David’s station area redevelopment    Exeter City Futures business plan    Net Zero Exeter plan delivery    Met Office supercomputer    University of Exeter Civic Agreement  The transformation of what was initially envisaged as a steering group for a major housing programme into a multi-purpose body overseeing Exeter’s post-pandemic recovery as well as its transport, infrastructure, economic, investment, decarbonisation, health and cultural strategies, while acting as a single point of contact with government and its departments and planning £500 million of expenditure, must surely constitute a “meaningful” change to its terms of reference and consequent reach.However whether the Liveable Exeter Place Board is a public sector body to which the normal rules of governance should apply is less a question of semantics and more a question of whether it meets government definitions of what constitutes such bodies.The council maintains that the board “is not an Exeter City Council board”. This is correct in the strict sense that Liveable Exeter Place Board was not formally constituted by a resolution of the Council.It is nevertheless likely that Liveable Exeter Place Board is a public sector body.Entities are classified as public or private sector according to Office of National Statistics criteria focussed on the level of direct or indirect control over the entity being classified and who has that control. Key indicators include:  the ability to appoint those in control, or those who determine the policy of the entity  a right to be consulted over such appointments, or to have a veto over appointments  the provision of funding accompanied by rights of control over how that funding is spent  a general right to control the day-to-day running of the body.Once a body is classified as public sector, it is allocated to a sub-sector based on its characteristics. The local government sub-sector “includes those types of public administration that only cover a specific locality and any non-market bodies controlled and mainly financed by them”.Exeter City Council’s chief executive officer and leader drew up the board’s terms of reference and determined (and continue to determine) its membership, as we saw last week.Exeter City Council provides the board’s secretariat, publishes its website complete with council contact email address and phone number and responds on its behalf to enquiries from the press and others.And Exeter City Council finances Liveable Exeter Place Board, as per the board-related expenditure recorded in its corporate accounts.

Instead of a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2010 levels by 2030, necessary to limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C according to the IPCC sixth assessment report published last month, current Paris Agreement signatory plans put us on course for a 16% increase by that date.Meanwhile, back in post-Brexit blighty, an analysis of how UK broadcasters are exposing audiences to climate change found that the word “cake” was used ten times more often than the phrase “climate change” on UK TV in 2020."

"content" : "Liveable Exeter Place Board is an unelected and unaccountable body that meets in private, does not publish its discussions or decisions and is taking responsibility for major policies which will determine the city’s future.Exeter Observer first examined its composition and role in July last year, when we identified the significant number of board members with known, substantial interests in land and property and the extent of its involvement in the city’s post-pandemic recovery plan.We also highlighted its role in relation to the “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme to build 12,000 new dwellings in the next 20 years, the “Net Zero Exeter 2030” decarbonisation plan and the Sport England local delivery pilot.We then followed up in February this year when the council responded to our questions about a second Church of England member being appointed to the board by accusing us of promoting a “partisan narrative” and claiming our public interest reporting about the board, which is focussed on its lack of transparency and scrutiny, “bears no resemblance to fact”.We have since sought to find out more about the how the board’s members are selected and appointed using freedom of information legislation.Volume house-building at Hill Barton Vale: Will the Liveable Exeter property development scheme do better?We asked Exeter City Council to provide information about the criteria used to select board members for appointment. It said it does not hold information about this “in a recorded format”, then voluntarily added:“The Liveable Exeter Place Board is not an Exeter City Council board.“As we look to prepare our city for the challenges of the future and ensure both sustainable growth and resilience, the Liveable Exeter Place Board was established to bring the city together to achieve this, in line with ECC’s Vision 2040.“The board allows the city a forum to discuss the key issues, including housing delivery, that affect both local government and local businesses, as well as other organisations, residents and visitors to Exeter and the region.“Members were appointed because they are senior people in their organisations and the work that they’ve done shows their capability for bringing alignment to the task in hand. This is particularly the case with national representatives of organisations connected with the housing and the cultural agenda.“Some individuals have been approached to provide sector insights, not as representatives but as individuals who may help illuminate subject matter and therefore provide a form of challenge and steer, such as small businesses and culture. Some individuals have been invited as a representative, such as the Chamber of Commerce.”Exeter City Council offices on Paris Street: Who is really calling the shots on Exeter’s future?We also asked the council to provide information about the process by which the board’s chair was appointed. It again said it held no recorded information about this, adding:“Sir Steve Smith was invited by Councillor Phil Bialyk and Karime Hassan to become the chair of the board because he is a respected figure within the city, region and, indeed, a national figure in education. Sir Steve is capable of convening leaders from across the institutions within the city and is an effective chair.”These additional comments are unusual, though welcome, instances of the council going beyond its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act. Given that no relevant information was held in recorded form it must be the case that the answers were prepared specifically in response to the requests.The council subsequently told us that they were authored by Karime Hassan, its Chief Executive and Growth Director.Exeter city centre from Exeter Cathedral roof: Who represents non-Anglican faith groups on Liveable Exeter Place Board?The council was less forthcoming on the matter of the considerations which led to the appointment of the Dean of Exeter Cathedral to the board, about which we also asked.It claimed the information had already been provided by the council leader, Phil Bialyk, when answering a public question at a full council meeting in April.Not quite. Councillor Bialyk’s reply was:“Over the course of the year, the chair of the Liveable Exeter Place Board has invited a number of people to join the board, in part as a consequence of the issues that have emerged during this pandemic.“This has been an extraordinary year and our leading institutions have been able to have frank conversations about the impact that COVID has had on their sectors and organisations. It has also raised issues that have highlighted gaps on the board and, no doubt, this will continue to be the case.“The cathedral is a major institution in the city, at the heart of the tourism and visitor economy and probably the biggest visitor draw to the city centre. In a very practical way COVID-19 and the production of a recovery plan highlighted the value of having the Very Reverend Jonathan Greener, Dean of Exeter Cathedral, as a member of the board.“Bishop Robert is also a significant figure in the spiritual life of the city and brings a unique insight and sensitivity to issues such as well-being, and provides a linkage to the wider Devon community and the role of the city in the region.”Whether or not this is a polite way of saying that the council appointed the wrong Anglican cleric in the first place, it continues to dodge the issue of why no other faiths are represented.When asked about the consideration which was given to appointing representatives of other faiths to the board, the council’s response was the bland and unhelpful statement: “The board is committed to ensuring inclusion and equality for all.”  Liveable Exeter Place Board membership update  Since we last reported on the board’s membership there have been further changes:            Mark Hopwood has returned to his post as Managing Director of Great Western Railway, replacing his stand-in Matthew Golton on the board.              Mark Peck, Group Director South West for Work and Health Services at the Department for Work and Pensions becomes the first representative of central government on the board.              Lady Studholme has retired as chair of the trustees of the Northcott Theatre but remains on the board in her new role as High Sheriff of Devon, so bringing to its work not only the accoutrements of an office that predates the Norman Conquest but also becoming the board’s first representative of the Crown.      Exeter City Council is well aware of how to make appointments in an open and fair manner. For example, the places on its new Harbour Board for non-councillors were filled after a selection process which began by publishing advertisements inviting people to apply and setting out the criteria against which applicants would be assessed.A similar process was followed for the council’s new Council Housing and Development Advisory Board.It would be normal practice for appointments to a body with a remit as significant as that of Liveable Exeter Place Board to be advertised widely and made transparently on the basis of objective assessment of candidates.No such process applies to Liveable Exeter Place Board appointments, nor has it ever.And the informal approach to membership continues, as evidenced in council leader Phil Bialyk’s April statement and in Exeter City Council’s insistence that it does not hold any paperwork in relation to the process of making board appointments.Exeter Observer has nevertheless seen two letters inviting people to join the board, both of which constitute “information in a recorded format” which should have been released by the council on request under freedom of information legislation.These make clear that the board’s chair, the unelected Sir Steve Smith, now has a role in making appointments, but neither explains how either invitation arose.Belmont Pleasure Ground: Who speaks for climate and environment on Liveable Exeter Place Board?The absence of members who might, for example, speak up for open spaces and the natural world, and so balance the presence of extensive land and property interests on the board, is either a glaring omission or a revealing reflection of its priorities.The failure to appoint board members to represent the many community and campaigning groups that comprise much of Exeter’s civil society, or those who have real experience of the hardship, disadvantage and poverty experienced by many Exeter residents, or the trade unions to which many of Exeter’s large public sector workforce belongs, not to mention the city’s non-Anglican faith groups, is similarly remiss.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            It is a departure from good governance that appointments to a self-evidently important - or even evidently self-important - board should be made in such a secretive and informal manner.While comparisons between the selection and appointment of Liveable Exeter Place Board members and the current Conservative government’s approach to appointments and procurement contracts, the much-criticised “chumocracy”, may be odious, they are unfortunately valid.Exeter City Council nevertheless claims to be “committed to openness and transparency”, as its pro forma responses to freedom of information requests all say."

"content" : "A new regional transport strategy for the South West has been outlined by Peninsula Transport in a vision document which it says sets the overall direction and principles of a plan “to transform transport within the region over the next thirty years”.Peninsula Transport, a consortium formed in 2018 by the five South West transport authorities and advised by representatives of transport operators and business, passenger and road user groups, is inviting comments on its strategic vision from residents, businesses and visitors to the region.Emphasising the consortium’s focus on the economy, Councillor Andrea Davis, who is Devon County Council Cabinet Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport as well as Chair of Peninsula Transport, said: “The key challenge for the peninsula is to strengthen strategic links to keep pace with the rest of the UK, reinforcing connectivity and maximising opportunities to boost productivity.”She also said: “With climate change and decarbonisation at the forefront of our agenda, it’s important that transport is fit for the future.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            However, while one of the goals listed in the document is “to deliver a net-zero carbon transport system”, it says this is to be achieved by “promoting walking and cycling”, “making the case for improvements to public transport”, relying on “better digital services” to enable people to work from home and aiming to deliver a “private and commercial” electric vehicle charging network.The document also identifies investment in the region’s roads as a priority.Mike Walton, chair of Exeter Cycling Campaign, said that rather than strengthening transport links in and out of the peninsula “the key challenge is to work out how we are going to decarbonise transport whilst keeping business and tourism alive.”He added: “Until our transport strategies commit to things like congestion charging, road-use charging, investing in safe walking and cycling routes, low emission zones and public transport investment then we’re not going to make the change we need.”South West peninsula car travel statistics. Source: Peninsula Transport.The vision document includes statistics which emphasise the region’s high car dependency rate. 90% of all journeys to work are made by car despite half the region’s workers travelling less than seven miles to work.The South West also has the highest private transport mileage per person and the second highest rate of private car ownership in the country.Other challenges are identified in a technical report cited in the document, which found that even if the Department for Transport’s “Acceleration to net zero emissions scenario” were achieved, South West road transport would still emit nearly a million tonnes of CO2e each year in 2050.It also found that “decarbonisation of vehicle fleets in the peninsula may lag behind the average, as historically older vehicles have been cascaded into the peninsula from other locations”.The report acknowledged that, while “encouraging people to use more sustainable modes has been one of the main aims of transport planning over the past twenty years”, this policy has been largely unsuccessful, it said “perhaps because of the affordability and convenience of car travel compared to other modes”.Peninsula Transport vision document. Source: Peninsula Transport.Peninsula Transport is inviting feedback on its strategic vision until this Friday, 17 September. It says responses will be used to inform the development of a detailed transport strategy which it expects to publish next year.However, the feedback survey consists of just three questions about the vision. It invites respondents to indicate to what extent they support or oppose a list of the five goals set out in the document as well as a single sentence top-level statement, with additional comments limited to 100 words.It then asks respondents to comment on transport challenges, opportunities and priorities for the region over the next 30 years in no more than 250 words."

Even before the pandemic, the area with the lowest average wages in the UK was North Devon.The South West is heavily reliant on retail, hospitality and tourism for employment, sectors in which employees often have low-paid, insecure jobs which were significantly affected by the pandemic.Emma Congreve of the University of Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute said the TUC’s findings revealed “a long-standing issue of low pay in sectors that have been particularly affected, meaning they are more likely to tip over the threshold into being able to claim universal credit.“The pandemic has exposed a number of underlying inequalities in the labour market.”Katie Schmuecker of Joseph Rowntree Foundation called the end of the uplift “the biggest overnight cut to the basic rate of social security since the Second World War”.There have been renewed calls to make the £20 uplift permanent as its abolition approaches.Analysis by Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows more than a third of working-age families in 413 parliamentary constituencies would be hit by the cut, 191 of which are represented by Conservatives.Conservative MPs Peter Aldous and John Stevenson wrote to Boris Johnson last month, describing universal credit as “a system that can better protect families when they face hardship” and asking him to reconsider the cut.In response, the Prime Minister said that the government’s preference would be for a “jobs-led recovery”, echoing Work and Pensions Minister Therese Coffey’s comments to MPs in July that the focus of support should be “strongly [on] getting people into work and jobs”.

"content" : "A damning Environment Agency report has found that South West Water has failed to meet pollution targets for the tenth year running.The annual assessment placed South West Water and Southern Water at the bottom of an environmental performance league table of water and sewerage companies in England.The Environment Agency uses measures such as the number of incidents of pollution caused by sewerage and the self-reporting of these incidents to gauge the environmental performance of each water company.South West Water was responsible for both the highest number of pollution incidents and the highest number of serious pollution incidents per 10,000km2 during 2020, the period covered by the report. The company’s performance was poorer than the previous year on both measures.It scored significantly worse than Southern Water, which was recently fined a record £90 million after pleading guilty in court to 6971 unpermitted pollution discharges over a period of five years.Environment Agency chair Emma Howard Boyd said the performance of South West Water gave “serious cause for concern” and “drags down the whole sector’s reputation”.She added: “When under pressure on the issue of pollution, there is still a tendency for some water companies to reach for excuses rather than taking action to reduce serious pollution incidents to zero.”The privately-owned regional water companies, which were created in 1989 through the sale of the nine regional water authorities in England, have each been awarded a rating out of four stars based on an annual environmental performance assessments since 2011.South West Water and Southern Water both received two star ratings for 2020, while six of the other companies were awarded the maximum four stars.South West Water has failed to achieve a rating higher than two stars since 2011, and has been awarded the lowest rating of one star three times during that period.The report said it had been significantly below target for the sewerage incidents metric for ten years in a row and described its performance as “consistently unacceptable”David Black, Interim Chief Executive at industry regulator Ofwat, said: “It’s disappointing to see repeat poor performance from some companies who are failing to take their responsibilities seriously enough.“A step-change in culture and commitment is required if the sector is to fundamentally change the way it delivers for customers and the environment.”Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said that the report made for “extremely disappointing reading”. She is to discuss the report’s findings with South West Water.Since privatisation the English regional water companies have assumed a total of £48 billion of debt, at an annual interest cost of £1.3 billion.Researchers at Greenwich University found that the companies paid out £53 billion in dividends to shareholders between 1989 and 2017, which led to an aggregate £51.7bn cash shortfall.A separate Guardian analysis concluded dividends paid between 1991 and 2019 amounted to £57 billion, nearly half the sum spent on maintaining and improving distribution systems and treatment plants during that period.At the same time water bills increased by more than 40% above the rate of inflation, driven mainly by continuously growing interest payments on debt.In the decade to 2020, South West Water paid £1.1 billion in dividends, while averaging £163 million per annum in pre-tax profits. Its parent company, Pennon Group, ended 2020-21 with a £3 billion cash surplus following the sale of waste management company Viridor, then paid out nearly £2 billion to shareholders.As a result of South West Water’s consistently poor environmental performance it has agreed a bespoke performance commitment with Ofwat aimed at achieving 4 star status by 2023 then maintaining it for a minimum of two years.South West Water acknowledged its failures in its 2021 annual report. It said: “Our performance in respect of wastewater pollution incidents did not achieve the improvements we had targeted.”“We have intervened and restructured our operation, established a new wastewater leadership team and aligned our business to improving our environmental performance.”Susan Davy, the company’s chief executive, said: “We are currently investing £150 million in our largest environmental programme for 15 years, which includes a commitment to reduce pollution by 80% and additional storage protection measures to enhance our bathing waters.“We know we can do more and are committed to doing so.”The Environment Agency report has highlighted wider concerns about the ongoing pollution of England’s waterways.The target of the government’s 25 year environment plan is for at least 75% of England’s water bodies to be close to their natural state “as soon as is practicable”.However, according to Environment Agency data, only 14% of English rivers were of a good ecological standard last year. None are of a good chemical standard, with discharges from sewage treatment works, agricultural run-off and industrial discharges largely to blame.Mark Lloyd, CEO of The Rivers Trust, said: “We need to see stronger regulation in this and other sectors. Every company should know that they will not get away with cost-cutting that results in pollution.”Westcountry Rivers Trust CEO Laurence Couldrick added: “Ordinarily, pollution would be countered through regulation, but the number of officers has reduced due to a halving of the government budget over the last decade.“Recent increases in the Environment Agency budget should help but it doesn’t restore enforcement to pre-2008 levels, so both sewage and agricultural pollution will continue.”The government claims to be tackling the problem of England’s polluted waterways through its new Environment Bill, which is intended to replace European environmental regulations and create a new watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection.The bill contains provisions intended to mitigate sewerage pollution incidents from storm overflows.However, according to the Environment Agency, only about 7% of rivers are polluted because of raw sewage from storm overflows. Nearly a third (32%) of rivers are failing to meet tests for good ecological status because of effluent from sewage treatment works.

An alliance of cross-bench and opposition peers has tabled more than 100 amendments to the Environment Bill, which is in its final parliamentary stages in the House of Lords, in an attempt to enhance protections for nature, air quality and water standards and to give the new watchdog more powers.The existing proposals do not give it independent power to issue binding judgments or force the government to take action.Laurence Couldrick warned that the bill may allow a lowering of environmental standards. He said: “The bill’s been watered down”, adding that its impact will be revealed when it comes to decisions around delivery such as “do we have development in this area or do we protect water quality?”"

Thanks for subscribing.Feel free to send feedback by replying to this email or get in touch with any comments or suggestions you may have.TOP STORIESTHE PBSA THAT DARES NOT SPEAK ITS NAMEExeter City Council approved plans to redevelop Harlequins shopping centre last year despite vehement opposition from residents, campaigners and conservation charities. Since receiving formal consent for the scheme the developer has submitted a revised application to return to an earlier, rejected, vision for the site which will replace the planned hotel with a second “co-living” block.The developer says coronavirus impacts since its 2019 planning application justify the scheme’s reversion to wholesale co-living. But the hotel remained throughout major changes made to the plans in the months after the pandemic began, and was still at their centre when the application was decided last autumn.A revised economic impact assessment now discounts the scheme’s claimed benefits and observers remain convinced the co-living blocks are student accommodation in all but name.Read the full story or join the conversation on Twitter.IN CITYPOINT’S SHADOWParts of Exeter city centre are experiencing an unplanned renaissance as small shops and cultural venues move in to fill empty units on Paris Street and Sidwell Street, but the council still intends to demolish and redevelop the area.Outline plans for what was once to be Princesshay II and is now known as “CityPoint” are being framed around massive build to rent blocks, on the basis of “very strong investor demand”, and hotels, offices and a brand new civic centre to house the council.Despite the threat of redevelopment a community arts centre has recently opened in a disused building on Sidwell Street. Positive Light Projects has transformed its three floors into artist studios, gallery space, a photography studio, offices and meeting space for local groups.First of a series in which Exeter Observer will look at businesses and projects in the area and consider their compatibility with the CityPoint redevelopment plans.Read more on our website or join the conversation on Twitter.IN CASE YOU MISSED ITUNIVERSITY DROPS ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WITH COUNCIL APPROVALA follow up on our coverage of the university’s plan to demolish 30 buildings to construct ~50,000m2 of new student accommodation, adding another 1,250 student bedrooms to its Streatham campus.The university describes the project as “an opportunity to develop an exemplar of environmentally sustainable buildings” but both it and the city council have dropped their published policy commitments to minimum construction standards for the development. Both organisations make lofty claims about world-leading climate ambitions but it appears neither plan to practice what they preach on the ground.EXE VALLEY GREEN SPACES AND HERITAGE HARBOUR SITE UNDER THREATExeter Civic Society and the progressive group of Green, Liberal Democrat and Independent city councillors have raised the alarm at the prospect of development on green spaces beside the River Exe and a heritage harbour site in the city’s historic canal basin.Bonhay Meadows, New Haven Field and the site of Exe Water Sports Association and the Ride On bicycle recycling project are all in the sights of the city council’s “Liveable Exeter” development scheme.NOTES &amp;amp; SKETCHESFREE TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD ITTorbay Council, Torbay Development Agency and Exeter City Council have “joined forces” to bid for 2025 UK City of Culture status, with their eyes on a prize of £300 million in claimed economic benefits.The bid is said to be inspired by the “closely connected coastal and city destinations” despite Brixham and Exeter being an hour and a half apart by public transport. A “cultural corridor” to “link the city to the sea” is proposed, presumably running down the A380 and showcasing the new Kingkerswell bypass.Andy Burnham dreamt up the quadrennial designation when he was culture secretary after seeing how much money flowed into Liverpool during its stint as 2008 European Capital of Culture.Ben Bradshaw, his successor at DCMS, announced the first competition the following year. Its previous winners were Derry in 2013 and Hull in 2017. Coventry is the current title holder.Runners and riders for 2025 apparently include Bradford, Chelmsford, Medway, Southampton and Cornwall. Plymouth is also rumoured to be considering a bid, offering the prospect of a south west peninsula playoff.Lancashire withdrew its county-wide “virtual city” bid from the competition last month after deciding that underwriting the project by up to £22 million was “too great a financial risk”.The Tees Valley Combined Authority, which was first to throw its hat into the ring for the 2025 competition back in 2015, put down £1.8 million to prepare its bid before also withdrawing earlier this year.It concluded that costs of up to £25 million were a bit steep for “someone to give us a pat on the head and give us a fancy title”.A shortlist of six applicants will be notified in September and the winning bid announcement is expected by the end of the year.BONANZA ON THE BUSES?There was no shortage of hyperbole to accompany last Sunday’s opening of Exeter’s glamorous new bus station.Certainly having four walls and some doors gives it the edge on the open-sided structure it replaced, but it’s not clear what makes its design “state of the art”, particularly as it doesn’t meet the BREEAM Excellent environmental construction standards required by the city’s core planning policies since 2013.This didn’t deter city council leader Phil Bialyk, a former bus driver, as was his predecessor Pete Edwards, from extolling the new station’s virtues, which include departure screens and, to the relief of many, public toilets.Prince Charles visited the new station earlier in the week, which prompted a minor media flurry, although none of the coverage we saw pointed out his abiding interest in the CityPoint redevelopment site.Stagecoach South West will operate the new facility but several of its services, those of other companies, and National Express and Megabus coaches will continue to use street stops in the area to pick up and drop off passengers.PRIORY VS PINHOEInitial proposals for changes to parliamentary constituency boundaries which will come into force in late 2023, and so are likely to affect the next general election, are currently out for consultation.Changes intended to make Parliament more representative by reducing variations in voter numbers between seats will reduce the Exeter constituency’s complement and entail moving its current boundary westwards.At the moment all Exeter City Council’s electoral wards form the parliamentary constituency except parts of Priory, St Loye’s and Topsham. These are divided by the current parliamentary boundary, although few people live in the section of Priory that is over the border, much of which consists of Ludwell Valley Park.The proposed changes would involve moving the remainder of these three wards out of Exeter. This would avoid the current ward split and reduce the Exeter constituency electorate of 80,676 to 71,713, firmly into the desired range.Another 11,512 Exeter electors already live in the East Devon constituency.The Ordnance Survey’s election maps site shows the current arrangements and the boundary commission’s website the proposed new boundaries.These changes would mean that the Exeter constituency would lose the lion’s share of Priory ward, which the Labour Party dominates in local elections.Cue Exeter City Council’s July Executive meeting, at which alternative proposals were agreed for submission to the boundary commission consultation.The committee report relied on the same number of voters residing in Priory and Pinhoe, somewhat simplifying the situation, to present the possibility of keeping Priory to jettison Pinhoe instead.Arguments in support included concern about which constituency gets the RD&amp;amp;E, which is apparently in the “urban heart of the city”, but Pinhoe’s history as a two-way Labour-Conservative marginal did not feature among them.Nor did the committee focus on the feelings of the residents of the rump of St Loye’s, some of whom may not be delighted by the prospect of Simon Jupp as their MP.The consultation on the initial boundary change proposals closes on Monday but there’s no need to panic if you’ve got better things to do this weekend than pore over maps and ponder the city’s psephology: a secondary consultation is planned for early 2022.COMMUNITY JOURNALISM TRAINING RETURNSExeter Observer was about to begin its third community journalism training course when the pandemic torpedoed our development plans back in March last year. Notwithstanding the still-shifting sands we are planning to pick up where we left off this autumn, in a large, well-ventilated city centre venue which enables effective indoor social distancing.Our courses are designed to help potential contributors quickly develop core journalism skills and produce publication quality content, with support from our experienced editorial team. We also offer complementary workshops on specialist topics including how to use freedom of information requests and other transparency legislation to hold local institutions to account.Our community journalism training is accessible, practical and free.

ON THE AGENDASW TRANSPORT NETWORK CONSULTATIONPeninsula Transport, the shadow sub-national transport body formed by the five South West peninsula transport authorities recently published its vision for the future of transport in the region. It intends to frame a full regional transport strategy which will plan and prioritise strategic infrastructure across the peninsula for the next thirty years. Plymouth City Council is gathering feedback and comment until 17 September.NEW LOCAL PLAN CONSULTATIONExeter City Council’s Executive outlined the first formal steps towards a new Exeter Local Plan at its meeting earlier this month. An eight-week public consultation will start in September which will consider an Issues consultation document (officer report here) and a new Statement of Community Involvement (officer report here).The first outlines the key issues the new local plan is intended to address, and is presented alongside the “Exeter 2040 Vision” and “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme. The second outlines the ways in which the public, organisations and “other interested parties” are involved in city planning processes. Both will be amended following the consultation and brought back for approval by council members before being used as a basis on which a formal draft Exeter Local Plan will be produced next year.ON OUR READING LISTHOUSE OF CARDSTransparency International’s recent report into the prevalence of property development interests among major Conservative Party donors found that 20% of the donations it received in the decade to 2020 came from companies and individuals with a substantial interest in the residential housing market.It also found that while government ministers held 669 meetings with 894 separate interest groups to discuss housing issues between January 2017 and March 2020, the statutory register of consultant lobbyists included additional information on just three of these groups.Meanwhile the FT has been working on its own analysis [paywall]. It found that the party has been given at least £17.9 million by donors with property interests in the two years since Boris Johnson became PM, one quarter of the total donations it received during that period. Rumour nevertheless has it that Robert Jenrick’s department is frantically trying to “de-Cheshamise” the planning reform bill before its expected publication in the autumn.NET ZERO LOCALGOV?Also this month, the National Audit Office followed up on December’s Achieving Net Zero report, in which it highlighted the critical role local authorities would have to play in decarbonisation, with an examination of the effectiveness of central government collaboration with councils around the issue.It identified “serious weaknesses” in the government’s approach, stemming from a “lack of clarity”, “piecemeal funding” and “diffuse accountabilities” which are creating “significant risks”.

"content" : "St Sidwell’s Community Centre is hosting a double celebration on Saturday. It will be the community centre’s twentieth anniversary and Sidwella Day, when Exeter’s patron saint is celebrated each year.Local residents are invited to enjoy an afternoon of good food, live music and activities from 2pm.Kofta, falafel, salad, cakes and hot and cold drinks will be served by volunteers from the community centre café, Sidwell Street Bakehouse and Olive Tree ESOL class, and Julie, the centre’s garden manager, will be inviting kids and families to learn more about the centre’s flora and fauna on a community garden discovery trail.A guided heritage tour of the area around the community centre will start at 12.30pm. It lasts an hour and a half and delves deep into the history of the eastern end of the city centre, known as the Grecian quarter after its earlier non-Roman inhabitants. Tickets are available from the community centre website.Rolling tours of the community centre are also on offer throughout the afternoon, including a chance to see the magnificent stained glass windows in the chapel at its west end.The community centre, which opened in 2001, is known to most as “St Sid’s”. It is an independent, entirely secular charity which welcomes everyone regardless of background, ability or circumstance and offers a range of activities, events and services for the local community.It runs a community café, a bakery and cookery school and free English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes. The centre also manages a large community garden, where events are held and organic fruit and vegetables are grown for use in the café, offers meeting rooms for hire to local groups and acts as a local heritage hub for Exeter city centre’s eastern quarter.In 2020, with crowdfunding support, the community centre refurbished what had been a Halfords chain store on the other side of Sidwell Street. It re-opened as a dedicated bakery and cookery school, where volunteers are trained in craft bread-making while making sourdough and other slow fermentation breads and cakes for sale over the counter and at Exeter Farmers’ Market.There are volunteering and work experience opportunities across all areas of the centre’s work. Gardening sessions have recently resumed, offering a chance to learn about tasks like seed sowing, weeding, planting, mowing, watering and more. Sessions are open to everyone and the centre provides tools, gloves, guidance and refreshments.St Sidwell’s Community Centre volunteers with Sidwella willow sculptureMost of Sidwell Street, including the community centre, was rebuilt in the 1950s after the destruction of the street in the 1942 Exeter Blitz, but the area has a rich history which dates back 2000 years. There have been four churches on the site, the first of which was built more than 1000 years ago.This Saturday’s celebrations mark Sidwella Day in honour of the patron saint of Exeter and namesake of Sidwell Street.Sidwella, who is believed to have lived during the 6th century, is said to have been a modest, chaste, virginal, devout and courageous local lass. At least she was until a couple of farmworkers apparently killed her with a scythe.The truth of this is far from certain, since the story appears to have been sexed up by Bishop Grandisson in the 14th century. He introduced a wicked stepmother into the story, who paid the farmworkers to do the deed, and the miraculous creation of a water spring where she fell.Nothing is known about Sidwella’s taste in architecture and we can only imagine what she might have made of today’s Sidwell Street, including the current 1957-58 replacement for the original Saxon St Sidwell’s Church. It was designed by the same firm that bequeathed the city the nearby supermarket building.She might, however, have concluded that the 21st century was not beyond redemption if she visited today and discovered what goes on within the former church’s walls.St Sidwell’s Sidwella 19th century stained glass window detailThe building is now divided into three parts: a small chapel at the west end, social housing on the two upper floors and the community centre itself.The chapel is used for services by a small but faithful congregation. Its centrepiece is a stunning stained glass window by the Bideford artist James Paterson installed in 1958, juxtaposing the murder of Sidwella with the 1942 bombing of the previous 19th century church on the site.Sidwella is not a “saint” in the sense of having been canonised but rather a local “martyr” recognised by the local bishop, a practice which became so uncontrolled that in the 16th century the Catholic Church took over and centralised authority for canonisations in Rome.However she could instead be seen variously as a symbol for civil society (the transfer of most of the church building to the community centre), the natural environment (the nearby well spring water) and, through her secularisation, as an image for a wider community of all faiths and none."

The developer says coronavirus impacts since its November 2019 planning application justify the scheme’s reversion to wholesale co-living. But the scheme was twice substantially revised after the application was submitted, in May 2020, two months after the pandemic arrived in the UK, and again in July. The hotel remained throughout the changes that were made.The application was not decided until 26 October 2020, by which time the second wave of the pandemic was well under way. Jones Lang LaSalle, the applicant’s agent, continued to extol the claimed benefits of the hotel in a letter sent to the council on the day its planning committee met.The consent that was granted for the previous scheme now becomes what is called a “material consideration” in the revised application, which means the council must take it into account when making its decision.Harlequins shopping centreThe revised scheme for the site is described as “very similar” to the approved plans. It has the same footprint as the previously proposed buildings and the overall design is unchanged.The developer emphasises a reduction in the height of the second block as the co-living bedspaces would have lower ceilings than the planned hotel rooms. This would amount to the building being 2’6” shorter.The internal layouts of both blocks have been altered, with slight increases in room and shared communal space sizes.According to the application statement “cluster rooms” (bedrooms in multi-occupancy flats which share a kitchen) are “approximately” 1m2 larger and amenity space, which is intended to be shared between the occupants of both blocks, has been increased by 0.43m2 per room to an average of 3.27m2 for each of the 378 bedspaces.In the revised plans “cluster rooms” are typically 13.5m2 and most of the studios are just over 18m2. The national minimum space standards are 37m2 for a one person dwelling (when it has a shower instead of a bath).The revised plans greatly increase the proportion of studio rooms to cluster flats. The co-living block which was approved in October was to include 99 studios and 26 cluster flats containing a total of 152 bedspaces.The revised scheme reconfigures that block to provide 143 studios and 18 cluster flats containing a total of 107 bedspaces, and adds another 128 studios in the block which is intended to replace the hotel. 72% of the rooms in the new scheme are studios, nearly double the share in the previous scheme.The developer cites the “high density mixed use development” envisaged by the city council’s “Liveable Exeter” property development programme in support of these arrangements.Diana Moore, Green Party councillor for St David’s ward, which includes the Harlequins site, described the co-living plans at the time of last year’s planning decision as “warehousing for people”.Harlequins revised redevelopment scheme - illustrative elevation. Image: Corsorphine &amp;amp; WrightThere were a wide range of other factors involved in the decision, in particular the impact on nearby heritage assets that the development would cause.These include the historic city wall that borders the site as well as numerous nearby grade I, II*, II and locally-listed buildings.The conclusion that the cumulative level of harm to these heritage assets was “less than substantial”, as well as the methods that were used to derive it, were strongly criticised by heritage experts and charities including The Georgian Group and The Victorian Society.Various claims about the economic, social and environmental benefits of the development were also given significant weighting in the original decision, although revisions to some of those claims which downgraded their value did not make it into the council planning officer’s report.Replacing the hotel with a second co-living block has prompted the production of a new economic impact assessment which estimates that the revised development “could support” a net total of 36 new jobs in the local economy. This is 20 fewer than the original plans.It was also widely assumed that, despite the developer’s claim that the scheme will be co-living, it is likely to be occupied largely by students. Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell, who is a member of the council planning committee, said that the then proposed co-living block “appears to be, in all but name, more student accommodation”.Keith Lewis of Exeter Civic Society also said: “The co-living accommodation appears to be exactly the same as that presented at consultation earlier in 2019 for student accommodation”.  Student accommodation by the back door?  The scheme’s developer Curlew is responsible for nearly 10,000 UK student beds.  It is a privately-owned, non-listed development and investment management company that specialises in student accommodation and build to rent in the UK and the Netherlands.  It is part of a complex group of companies of which at least 73 are registered off-shore in Guernsey.  One of the company’s senior development managers, who joined it in April 2020, was previously responsible for the development of controversial 360-bed student blocks behind Exeter City Football Club’s ground at St James Park and another 150 bedspaces at Exeter Cricket Club’s ground on Prince of Wales Road.  They were developed by Yelverton Properties, itself part of a complex group of companies.  The company was also responsible for the 500+ bedspace Printworks student block on Western Way.When the council approved the previous Harlequins redevelopment scheme, a coalition of local residents and campaigners, local conservation charities and community groups including Exeter Civic Society, Devon Archeological Society and Devon Buildings Group, backed by The Victorian Society and The Georgian Group, unsuccessfully appealed to the Secretary of State to call in the decision.Does the developer’s attempt to acquire permission to replace the hotel with a second co-living block on the site offer another opportunity to intervene?The council says the revised application will be dealt with through the planning process in the usual way, and is likely to come before the planning committee for determination later this year.The application can be viewed on the city council website, where comments are invited."

"content" : "Torbay Council, Torbay Development Agency and Exeter City Council have “joined forces” to bid for 2025 UK City of Culture status, with their eyes on a prize of £300 million in claimed economic benefits.The bid is said to be inspired by the “closely connected coastal and city destinations” despite Brixham and Exeter being an hour and a half apart by public transport. A “cultural corridor” to “link the city to the sea” is proposed, presumably running down the A380 and showcasing the new Kingkerswell bypass.Andy Burnham dreamt up the quadrennial designation when he was culture secretary after seeing how much money flowed into Liverpool during its stint as 2008 European Capital of Culture.Ben Bradshaw, his successor at DCMS, announced the first competition the following year. Its previous winners were Derry in 2013 and Hull in 2017. Coventry is the current title holder.Runners and riders for 2025 apparently include Bradford, Chelmsford, Medway, Southampton and Cornwall. Plymouth is also rumoured to be considering a bid, offering the prospect of a south west peninsula playoff.Lancashire withdrew its county-wide “virtual city” bid from the competition last month after deciding that underwriting the project by up to £22 million was “too great a financial risk”.The Tees Valley Combined Authority, which was first to throw its hat into the ring for the 2025 competition back in 2015, put down £1.8 million to prepare its bid before also withdrawing earlier this year.It concluded that costs of up to £25 million were a bit steep for “someone to give us a pat on the head and give us a fancy title”.A shortlist of six applicants will be notified in September and the winning bid announcement is expected by the end of the year."

"content" : "Positive Light Projects, a community arts initiative led by photographer and former Exeter College lecturer Brendan Barry, opened a new education and resource centre earlier this month in the Sidwell Street building that used to contain clothing chain Peacocks.It is one of several organisations which have taken advantage of the opportunity to move into empty buildings which were prematurely cleared because of plans to redevelop what is now known as the CityPoint development site but was previously intended to be an extension of Princesshay shopping centre.These include Maketank, an artists’ collective which has transformed a three-storey building on Paris Street into a creative, rehearsal and performance space and ArtWork Exeter, which is based in the Awesome Art Space gallery further down the street.Independent retailers including houseplant specialist Hutch, wine, cheese and cider supplier Pullo, the Cuckoo taproom and bottleshop and Kids Hub Coffee, a cafe with children’s play area, have also set up shop there.The east side of Paris Street has been visibly transformed, and a similar process is underway on the south side of Sidwell Street, where Positive Light Projects has joined The Sidwell Street Bakehouse, a St Sidwell’s Community Centre project which trains volunteers in craft bread baking and sells high-quality loaves in what was a branch of Halfords.Independent retailers on Paris StreetAfter negotiating a lease on the old Peacocks building, Brendan Barry has spent the past few months, aided latterly by a team of volunteers, turning its three dreary floors into artist studios, project and gallery space, a darkroom and photography studio, meeting spaces for creatives to mix and mingle and office, private study and studio space for local groups.The ground floor, which retains the former shop windows, is particularly flexible, being a large single space with new moveable walls which can be used to subdivide it.He describes Positive Light Projects as “a not for profit organisation using the visual arts to engage and inspire a diverse range of audiences and communities as well as developing emerging artists and aiding them move their practice forward in exciting and innovative ways” and says it has “a focus on and strong belief in community based, socially engaged creative practice”.It is incorporated as a community interest company and the appointment of a full board of directors is underway.Positive Light Projects - ground floor open spaceMr Barry does not envisage a formal grand opening, but intends to bring the facilities on stream as they become available for use. His business model is based on providing a mix of facilities and activities, some chargeable, some not. His aim is that the project will become as self-sufficient as possible.Planned activities include:  Courses for developing and emerging practitioners  Workshops covering contemporary and traditional technical and contextual approaches to photography and the visual arts  Talks by internationally-recognised artists on their work and professional practice  Symposia exploring concepts within and approaches to the visual arts  Exhibitions of the work of high profile and emerging artists  Community art showcases  Resident practitioners who create work on site  Commissions which fund the production of new work.The first Positive Light Projects course, in photographic skills, began on 9 July and is being delivered in partnership with Exeter’s CoLab and Exeter Homeless Partnership. People with lived experience of homelessness have been encouraged to take part.Positive Light Projects - photographic studio under constructionFunding is a major challenge for community start-ups. Positive Light Projects raised more than £35,000 from 405 supporters in 35 days via a successful Crowdfunder campaign. Brendan Barry emphasises that all those people have invested emotionally as well as financially in the project.A further £15,000 was provided from locality budgets held by Devon county and Exeter city Councillors. Mr Barry says that building refurbishment works will cost £45,000 and the remainder will be used for community projects planned for the rest of the summer.More recently Exeter City Council awarded the project just over £12,500 from its strategic fund, which is aimed at refurbishing community buildings.Amal Ghusain, lead councillor for culture and communities, said: “Positive Light is a fantastic project that is playing an important role in reinvigorating Sidwell Street and could be the spark for other artistic and cultural initiatives to follow and take root.”Positive Light Projects - Sidwell Street entranceHowever Exeter City Council intends a major redevelopment of the site bounded by Sidwell Street, Paris Street and Cheeke Street, which includes the new bus station and St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre as well as Positive Light Projects and its independent neighbours.Its plans have their origin in the September 2017 failure of previous private sector-led proposals for its redevelopment, which were supposed to be delivered in parallel with the publicly-funded construction of the bus station and leisure centre.The private sector redevelopment was to be led by joint landowner The Crown Estate, a UK property portfolio which belongs to the British sovereign but is managed by a semi-independent body, and its development partner TH Real Estate.It was envisaged as an extension of the existing Princesshay shopping centre and presented as “a comprehensive retail-leisure led mixed use development”.The plans received outline planning approval from Exeter City Council in July 2016. To prepare for demolition The Crown Estate then began terminating leases on Sidwell Street and Paris Street.The city council was upbeat until September 2017 when its leader and chief executive were summoned to London. There The Crown Estate explained it would not be proceeding with its development plans, citing market conditions. A public announcement followed a few days later.At the same time, the contractor being lined up by the council to build the leisure complex and new bus station also withdrew its interest in proceeding.The city council subsequently found a new contractor and started work on the publicly-owned part of the site. The new bus station is due to open on Sunday and St Sidwell’s Point later this year.CityPoint redevelopment scheme drawingTo fill the void left by The Crown Estate’s change of plan, the council commissioned a consultancy study of alternative uses for the site from Jones Lang LaSalle, the firm which presented the controversial redevelopment proposals for Harlequins shopping centre last year.This set out an outline plan for a new development including several build to rent blocks with hotel accommodation, retail and cafes, office space and a new civic centre. What was now to be called CityPoint would involve the demolition of the remaining buildings on the site and the construction of a total of just under a million square feet of new buildings, just short of double the size of Princesshay.The outline was presented to councillors in December 2018 and officers were authorised to work up a development plan.Meanwhile, the commercial life of Paris Street and the south side of Sidwell Street decayed as businesses either decided they had no future in an area of planning blight or were compelled to leave because their leases were being terminated.Chain stores Peacocks and Halfords vacated their Sidwell Street premises and Paris Street lost the community-owned Real Food Store café and shop. This was forced to split in two, the shop successfully relocating to Queen Street but the café subsequently closing after moving to the foyer of Exeter’s central library. Other small businesses also closed.The city council Executive then revisited its redevelopment plan in September 2019, when it agreed to progress the scheme by entering into a joint ownership and land promotion agreement with the other main partners, and again in June last year, when it reviewed the scheme’s viability in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and decided to press on by accelerating the redevelopment process.The city council, again following advice from Jones Lang LaSalle, said it was “keen to ensure that we look to maintain momentum on key projects such as this which will define the city’s future as we emerge from the pandemic”. This was principally on the basis of “very strong investor demand for opportunities in the Built to Rent sector”.Positive Light Projects - entrance areaEmpty shop premises are to no one’s advantage. They are an eyesore and the fabric of the buildings that houses them suffers through lack of daily use and maintenance. The city’s trading offer is reduced and their landlords have no rental income.Rather than demolish and rebuild to suit the interests of investors and property developers, the way that independent businesses and organisations have stepped in to fill the unplanned voids on Paris Street and Sidwell Street may present a better way forward for the city centre.They have successfully negotiated viable, if not long-term, leases, are providing paid and voluntary local employment opportunities and are ensuring that any profits remain in the city rather than being extracted by remote corporate shareholders.Positive Light Projects has been able to transform the old Peacocks building with support from both the community and a network of partner organisations. Alongside CoLab and the Exeter Homeless Partnership, Exeter Phoenix and Exeter College are also involved: the new creative hub hosted the college’s annual Diploma Art and Design Exhibition in June.

Brendan Barry sees partnerships as a way of building trust in what Positive Light Projects has to offer. He believes that many of the people he wants to engage are unlikely to respond to a “Welcome, come in!” sign on the front door, and will need to be encouraged by others to put themselves forward.When asked whether he feels secure about the future, he answers in the negative. He recognises that the shadow of CityPoint means that he and the other tenants in the area could be required to vacate their premises at any time if redevelopment becomes a reality.Meanwhile, the city is witnessing the transformation – however temporary – of standard retail units into a series of unique locally-run businesses which strengthen the community, enhance the city’s cultural offering and are making strides towards building a better Exeter without a demolition order in sight."

Talking a good talk is not the same as doing the right thing.”Read the full story or join the conversation on Twitter.EXE VALLEY GREEN SPACES AND HERITAGE HARBOUR SITE UNDER THREATExeter Civic Society and the progressive group of Green, Liberal Democrat and Independent city councillors have raised the alarm at the prospect of development on green spaces beside the River Exe and a heritage harbour site in the city’s historic canal basin.Bonhay Meadows, New Haven Field and the site of Exe Water Sports Association and the Ride On bicycle recycling project are all in the sights of the city council’s “Liveable Exeter” development scheme.Read more on our website or join the conversation on Twitter.KINDER EXETER FESTIVAL BRINGS COMPASSION AND COLOUR TO CITY CENTREJenna McGill, a Diploma student with the National Council for the Training of Journalists has just joined Exeter Observer as a trainee reporter. We’re delighted to have her on the team.For her first story she covered a community festival facilitated by artists’ collective Maketank which brought artists, academics, students and other Exeter folk together for online and COVID-safe outdoor events in city centre green spaces. The story is here and tweet here.ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST DEFIANT AFTER SECOND LIABILITY ORDER FOR NON-PAYMENT OF COUNCIL TAXJenna’s second story: a lone parent from Crediton who has withheld council tax for two years in protest over government climate crisis inaction was in front of magistrates at Exeter Law Courts last week while Extinction Rebellion demonstrated in support outside.The hearing coincided with the launch of Extinction Rebellion’s Earth Tax Strike, the latest in a long line of tax resistance protests which goes back centuries. The story is here and tweet here.IN CASE YOU MISSED ITDOES DCC’S NET ZERO INVESTMENT STRATEGY STAND UP TO SCRUTINY?While fossil fuel company shareholder activism around Paris Agreement-compatible goals has increased, it has not prevented continuing oil and gas exploration, extraction, production or consumption. Shell and BP, in which Devon’s public sector pension fund has invested nearly £57 million of scheme members’ money, recently held AGMs which illustrate the point.DISTRICT HEATING NETWORK GOES UP IN SMOKEA plan to supply the South West Exeter development of 2500 homes with heat from the Marsh Barton waste incinerator has been abandoned because most of the property developers involved in the scheme are unwilling to accept modest additional up front costs. Local authorities had promised £7.3 million to the project, which relied on the city’s largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions.INFORMATION WANTS TO BE FREEThis time last month Open Democracy won its three year legal battle with the Cabinet Office over its secretive “Clearing House”, which has been accused of obstructing the release of material under the Freedom of Information Act and “blacklisting” journalists and campaigners.Judge Chris Hughes found that there was a “profound lack of transparency about the operation” and criticised the Cabinet Office for a “lacuna in public information” around the way the Clearing House co-ordinates freedom of information request responses. The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs select committee has now launched an inquiry into how the Clearing House handles requests and whether its measures comply with the Freedom of Information Act.NOTES &amp;amp; SKETCHESLONGBROOK STREET PBSA GIFTED SECOND LIFEExeter City Council planning officers approved the renewal of planning permission for an eight storey 108-bed student accommodation block on the site of the King Billy public house which had previously been granted in April 2018 and since lapsed.The plans include provision for street level retail despite the developers of the monolithic student block on Cheeke Street known as “The Depot” seeking to convert several of its ground floor retail units to student bedrooms because commercial tenants cannot be found for the shops.Look out for the Longbrook Street developers pleading the same case in due course.ON THE BEACHThe Heart Of The South West Local Enterprise Partnership confirmed that its bid to house the UK Atomic Energy Authority STEP fusion test reactor in Bridgewater Bay passed the first stage of the competitive site nominations process.The government’s long list of fifteen sites is now being whittled down in Whitehall.Don’t all rush at once: the project’s initial aim is not to produce a concept design until 2024.PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF THE WEEKIn a hotly-contested field, this week’s winner must surely be the new Exeter Civic University Agreement, which found its way onto last night’s city council Executive agenda.Laced with the language of estate agency, this document envisages a utopian future for the city with the rest of the UK following behind.

In a speech to the Local Government Association earlier this week, communities secretary Robert Jenrick indicated that he was no longer intending the pursue the radical changes promised in last year’s white paper.He said he wanted to see “sensible and pragmatic reforms” but did not think the government needed “to rip up the planning system and start again”. The Housing, Communities and Local Government select committee report considering the plans offers useful analysis for those who want to know more. The government is expected to publish its proposals next month.HOW GREEN IS MY INDUSTRIAL VALLEY?Centre-right think tank Onward published a report assessing the labour market challenges entailed by the UK’s decarbonisation plans this week. It says 3.2 million people will need to retrain or increase their skill levels, with the construction sector affected most of all. It also examines regional exposure to the required changes: the South West is less vulnerable than many areas because of its relatively low levels of carbon-intensive industries. But this means that there are fewer economic opportunities in carbon mitigation activity here too.One striking finding from the report is that while 1.1 million workers will be required to retrofit homes and decarbonise domestic heating by 2030, only 5,700 are currently being trained to do these jobs each year.PINF PINCHThe Public Interest News Foundation yesterday published the first survey of the UK’s independent news publishing sector. Research carried out by Clare Cook and Dr Coral Milburn-Curtis of the Media Innovation Studio at the University of Central Lancashire found that the reach of the sector far outstrips its revenue: the 56 survey respondents reached 10 million monthly unique users last year but their combined revenues were less than £5.4 million.In contrast Reach, the UK’s largest commercial publisher and the company which dominates Devon’s news media, reached an average of 42.1 million users per month in 2020 with revenue of just over £600 million.REUTERS REPORTThe tenth annual edition of the University of Oxford’s journalism research institute global news survey offers its familiar deep dive into the sector. Outputs include:  The trust gap between the news in general and that found in aggregated environments has grown, with audiences seemingly placing a greater premium on accurate and reliable news sources.  Facebook is seen as the main channel for spreading false information almost everywhere.  In the UK, despite audiences relying on search engines and social media for information on jobs, “things to do”, weather forecasts and even COVID-19, they still think of newspapers as the best destination for local politics.  In the UK both left and right feel that their political views are unfairly covered by the media.Start with the extended executive summary then take a deep breath and download the full report.HELP POWER THE PUBLIC INTEREST JOURNALISM EXETER NEEDSExeter Observer is produced and published by people like you who share a mission to strengthen civil society and help people participate more effectively in local democracy.Our capacity to hold wealth, power and the influence of individuals and institutions to account depends on having sufficient resources to investigate their actions and challenge them in the public sphere.When you join Exeter Observer you don’t just become an active supporter of the public interest journalism that Exeter needs, you become co-owner of a new kind of editorially and financially independent community news organisation.We believe good quality local public interest journalism can only be delivered by a non-profit business model which doesn’t invade the privacy of its audience, facilitate the spread of fake news or rely on advertorial, clickbait or recycled press releases.With your support we can deliver in-depth articles and investigative journalism that is critically engaged with major challenges facing our city around democracy, development and the climate crisis while amplifying local voices and reflecting our community and cultural life.You can find out more about how Exeter Observer is run or simply join us on our mission.Together we can power the independent journalism Exeter needs: with public interest at its heart."

"content" : "Exeter Civic Society and the progressive group of Green, Liberal Democrat and Independent city councillors have raised the alarm at the prospect of development on green spaces beside the River Exe and a heritage harbour site in the city’s historic canal basin.Exeter City Council is considering developing sites at Bonhay Meadows, the canal basin and in the heart of Riverside Valley Park as part of its “Liveable Exeter” property development scheme while claiming that the scheme “will protect and enhance Exeter’s exceptional natural and historic environment, safeguard its iconic landscape setting and encourage high-quality design that complements and enhances the city’s heritage.”It first emerged that the council was considering these developments when council leader Phil Bialyk listed what he described as “a pipeline of future development opportunities for the council to consider as part of a five year development programme” in a committee meeting last year.Diana Moore, Green Party councillor for St David’s ward, in which all three sites are located, then confirmed the council’s intent at a meeting in April.She said: “In response to questions I asked at a council meeting, the Labour leader of the city council failed to provide assurance that valuable green spaces in the city – vital for wildlife and biodiversity – would be safe from future development.“He confirmed that Bonhay Meadows is being considered as a development site and refused to rule out development on the green space between the river and Exeter Ship Canal.”Bonhay Meadows Liveable Exeter development siteExeter Civic Society said it was “appalled to discover that Exeter City Council is considering building homes on the city’s green spaces” and is “likely to rigorously oppose building” on all three sites.Keith Lewis, acting chair of the society, has written to Phil Bialyk to express his concern that the proposals were not highlighted in May’s local elections manifestos and that no consultation concerning them had taken place with local communities.He said: “It seems that there has been no dialogue with local councillors, let alone with the communities in which [the development sites] are located.“The society is concerned that the city council will present the public with a fait accompli rather than undertaking genuine community consultation in line with government guidelines.”“This reinforces the council’s disregard for genuine public consultation.”Addressing the council leader directly, he said: “I urge you to publish development proposals for all the sites identified in your paper last year to get public opinion before spending too much on research and architects fees”, adding: “What do you have to hide?”Bonhay Meadows Liveable Exeter development site entrance via flood defence scheme gate No.6Bonhay Meadows, which is described as “accessible amenity green space” by the city council, has been identified as a prospective site for 97 dwellings which would be built by Exeter City Living Ltd, the city council’s property development company.It is a 1.6 acre grass and wildflower meadow bordered by mature trees which lies on the east bank of the river, north of the Exe Bridges crossing.It is located on the river side of the flood defence scheme wall which has been constructed to protect existing buildings nearby. Exeter City Living was described as “in dialogue” with the Environment Agency over this issue.At the April meeting at which Phil Bialyk defended the council’s approach he said: “Exeter City Living, the development arm of the city council, is examining, and will continue to examine, the suitability of land for development in accordance with the vision for Liveable Exeter - including sites such as Bonhay Meadows.”He added: “We are not ruling anything out, nor should we.”Exeter Ship Canal basin Liveable Exeter development site location plan. Image: Canal Basin masterplan.The site identified for development at the canal basin currently houses Exe Water Sports Association and the Ride On bicycle recycling project. Around 50 build-to-rent dwellings would take their place, also constructed by Exeter City Living Ltd.These proposals are consistent with the Canal Basin masterplan, which says: “The existing buildings do not make sufficient contribution to the character of the conservation area to warrant retention. The quality of the townscape may be improved by sensitive re-development.”It adds: “Contemporary architecture that is clearly respectful of its context is required” and identifies historic elements for retention in any redevelopment, including the wall which runs along Haven Road, which originally enclosed the basin, and a locally listed gateway and piers which must be retained and incorporated into any design for the site.It specifies that “two storey residential scale buildings are required” on the site beside 60 Haven Road, which is a Grade II listed building which previously part-housed Exeter Maritime Museum and, more recently, the Boatyard Bakery. It also says that “three to three and a half storey residential scale buildings are required” on the rest of the site.It is not clear how the council intends to fit 50 dwellings onto the site given these planning policy restrictions.Exeter Ship Canal Liveable Exeter development site illustrative elevations. Image: Canal Basin masterplan.There have been calls for the canal basin masterplan to be updated, both because of its age - it was adopted as planning policy seventeen years ago, in July 2004 - and because it does not specify that the uses of buildings in the area must be waterway-related.Six years ago Exeter Civic Society set up a River, Canal and Quayside sub-committee which subsequently published a report focussed on the future of the quay and the canal basin area.It said: “One of its qualities is that it is relaxed and not crassly and commercially over-exploited. We want to see this quality preserved while its distinctive heritage, tourist, arts and educational potential is sensitively developed.”Exeter Ship Canal Liveable Exeter development siteThen in 2016 the Friends of Exeter Ship Canal was established with support from the civic society and went on to develop a close relationship with the Inland Waterways Association.This led to  last year’s heritage harbour status award to the Port of Exeter, the first such award in the south west.The Friends of Exeter Ship Canal also published a report in which it outlined considerations which were necessary if the canal – and particularly the canal basin – was to become more than an environment shaped by the demands of investment finance.It called for better promotion of the canal, new slipways, residential moorings, canal holidays and development of heritage and maritime activities in the canal basin. It did not call for new housing development.Exeter Ship Canal Liveable Exeter development site listed wall, gateway and piers at Exe Water Sports AssociationFollowing the heritage harbour award, the Inland Waterways Association and Friends of Exeter Ship Canal also jointly published a new vision and action plan for the canal.John Monks of Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal said: “The city council and [quay and canal] trust are both enthusiastic about the Heritage Harbour designation the Friends achieved for the canal and basin as integral parts of the Port of Exeter.“To get the most from it depends on their seeing it not so much as a status flag but as a stimulus to work together on creating the maritime heritage revival that is at the heart of every heritage harbour.”Unsurprisingly, the action plan also does not propose housing development in the canal basin.Keith Lewis of Exeter Civic Society said: “The heritage harbour status obtained by the Friends of Exeter Ship Canal should now require the council to think again about what should be done around the basin and canal if that initiative is to be a success.“The existing basin masterplan has not been fit for purpose for some time now and should not be used to justify building a large number of homes there.”New Haven Field in Exeter’s Riverside Valley ParkThe third site threatened by the Liveable Exeter property development scheme is in Exeter’s Riverside Valley Park between the ship canal and the river, a short walk from the canal basin.It is a 2.4 acre grass meadow known as New Haven Field which is bordered by mature hedgerows and trees and tucked between Trews Weir allotments and Bromhams Playing Fields.It is described as “accessible natural green space” by the city council.Details about development plans for this site remain unclear, but it appears to be mentioned in a county council transport infrastructure implementation report which describes a “new crossing of the canal in Haven Banks linked to development”.New Haven Field is only a short distance from the railway station being built beside the Marsh Barton waste incinerator.Diana Moore said: “Important and much loved green and wooded spaces run along the river and canal - that’s precisely why they are recognised in the Exeter valley parks strategy.“These spaces need protection and nurturing. The opportunities lie in planting trees and helping nature - not putting a development price tag on them.”New Haven Field in Exeter’s Riverside Valley ParkHaving previously planned to sell part of Bull Meadow Park and all of Northbrook Approach golf course for housing development, the city council changed course after community campaigns to save both green spaces.Phil Bialyk subsequently said, in the run up to this year’s local elections: “Where we can we will protect open and green spaces. We have still got to deliver housing - that’s where our Liveable Exeter programme comes in and it is very important.“But I want us to save green spaces and keep them for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. We have done all lot already - protecting Bull Meadow and Northbrook.”Independent councillor Jemima Moore recently highlighted that a community campaign had, in fact, helped save the Northbrook site.She said: “As so often in Exeter, it was a community campaign that helped secure the Northbrook for nature and wildlife. We need to see the Labour-led council do more to identify and protect in perpetuity the city’s crucial green spaces.”Liberal Democrat councillor Kevin Mitchell added: “The almost universal support for a wildlife-focussed future for the Northbrook site demonstrates how Exeter residents value green spaces and trees, and see these as vital for wildlife, recreation and health.“They also need to be aware, however, that the city’s green spaces aren’t guaranteed protection under Labour.”"

"content" : "Environmental activist Imogen May had a second liability order for non-payment of council tax made against her when she appeared before Exeter magistrates last Thursday.The lone parent of two from Crediton began withholding her council tax payments to Mid Devon District Council in April 2019 in protest over government investment in fossil fuel industries and what she called “vanity projects like HS2”.She now owes nearly £2,500 but said she is “more than comfortable” with the consequences of her actions, despite the risk of prison. She said: “If it happens, then I will be prepared to do that.”She said she has never denied liability for council tax but that she believes tax revenues should stay in the community, where local councillors and citizens’ assemblies can best decide how they are spent. That way, she said: “We can build resilient sustainable communities with a sense of ownership and responsibility.”She has used the withheld tax to create what she described as a “nature therapy space” for teenagers in her garden. Children from her local secondary school are due to visit to look at the garden with a view to using it tomorrow.She said: “My whole point is the environment and my time and money goes into developing the space. If we don’t connect our kids to the natural world so they have an understanding of it then we don’t have anything.”Extinction Rebellion climate activist Imogen MayMiss May previously had a council tax liability order made against her by Exeter magistrates in June 2019.At the time she said: “When April came around and a bill arrived I just decided ‘no’. I am a single parent, I don’t have £100 a month to throw away on the things not necessary to change the future.“We are facing a sixth mass extinction and we need to act now. I believe I have a moral obligation as a parent to do just that. We need to raise awareness. We need to act.”She refused to comply with the order, prompting enforcement action by Mid Devon District Council.She said: “I’ve had maybe five different bailiffs trying to extract this money from me, but I’m not frightened of that.”If such enforcement action fails, councils in England can apply to magistrates for a committal to prison for up to three months.Extinction Rebellion activists at Exeter Law Courts protestAround twenty members of environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion gathered in support of Miss May outside Exeter Law Courts before last week’s hearing. They displayed banners saying “Climate Justice Now” and “Government Must Act on the Truth”.The hearing coincided with the launch of Extinction Rebellion’s Earth Tax Strike, part of its Money Rebellion campaign of what it calls “financial civil disobedience”.It will involve 100 activists who have pledged to withhold 3% of their income, business and/or council taxes until the UK government takes decisive steps to combat the climate and ecological emergency.This proportion represents the amount of government spending that Extinction Rebellion says “causes ecocide”. The figure has been calculated from the combined costs of the government’s £27 billion road-building programme and its investments in domestic and overseas fossil fuel industries and the controversial HS2 rail project.As part of their pledge, the Earth Tax Strike protestors have signed an open letter to HMRC outlining the reasons for their action.Earth Tax Strikes banner at Exeter Law Courts protestTax resistance as a form of protest goes back centuries and has played a role in numerous political movements including the Peasants’ Revolt, the American Revolution and the women’s suffrage movement.Extinction Rebellion’s Claire Richards, who took part in last week’s demonstration in Exeter, said that although Imogen May’s protest is not part of the Earth Tax Strike she has become a key figure in the Money Rebellion movement because of her stance.She said: “Imogen did her own thing off her own back really early on. So when the government and the local councils originally declared a climate emergency she decided there and then she would stop paying her council tax, because if you declare an emergency then every decision from then on should be aligned with that and clearly they are not.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Miss May represented herself at the hearing, which was postponed from last year because of the coronavirus pandemic.It’s not clear what Mid Devon District Council’s next steps will be, but says she would welcome an escalation and is keen to find out what happens next.She said: “I want to invite them [the council] to explain why they’ve been ignoring this situation, but I expect they just don’t know what to do with me.”"

"content" : "Exeter City Council has given the University of Exeter permission to demolish 30 buildings and construct 50,000m2 of new student accommodation on a fifteen acre section of the Streatham campus.The development, which will be more than ten times the size of the new St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre, will add around 1,250 new student bedrooms to the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village student accommodation sites on the north west corner of the campus between Cowley Bridge Road and Streatham Drive.The Clydesdale and Nash Grove accommodation buildings, which were built between 1989 and 1992, will all be demolished and replaced with six new student blocks between three and eight storeys tall. Several will be much taller than the existing buildings.The two storey Birks Grange Village refectory, which was built in 1965, will be demolished and replaced with a six storey student accommodation block.Five of the fifteen Birks Grange Village accommodation blocks, which were built between 2005 and 2011, will be renovated to improve their energy efficiency, while the university Estate Services Centre will also be demolished and replaced with a three and four storey accommodation block. The Estate Services Centre will be relocated to a new 3.5 acre site on the north side of the campus near the Belvidere Meadows nature reserve.In total, twelve accommodation blocks, three other large buildings and a range of other structures such as bike and bin stores will be demolished to make way for new construction.The university describes the project as “an opportunity to develop an exemplar of environmentally sustainable buildings; moving well beyond statutory compliance to provide a new standard of low-carbon student accommodation”.However, apart from one three and one five page report submitted with the university’s planning applications, which provide outline energy consumption estimates for some of the planned new buildings and summary descriptions of their Passivhaus design, no further assessment of the development’s carbon footprint has been performed.Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment demolition plan. Image: Willmore Iles.Passivhaus is a twenty year-old approach to building design which primarily focusses on operational energy efficiency via use of insulation, ventilation and passive solar gain, among other approaches to reducing energy consumption.This approach is championed by Exeter City Council: it has been mentioned in nearly 50 city council press releases since November 2018).Passivhaus design reduces the carbon footprint of buildings by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, but although it may involve consideration of the much wider range of climate and environmental impacts involved in construction, there is no requirement that it does.And some construction materials which deliver very high energy performance, such as triple-glazed glass, may embody more carbon than they save, depending on the lifespan of the building.So Passivhaus is low energy, but not necessarily low carbon: the operational energy efficiency on which it focuses represents less than a third of the carbon footprint of residential buildings.This is how the design of the city council’s St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre can rely on extensive use of very high impact materials such as concrete and steel in its construction and still be certified Passivhaus.As its foundation piles were being filled in 2019, the council proudly announced that 150 lorry loads of concrete were to be used in the first phase of building alone and that the site crane needed a concrete base deeper than a three storey building.The iron and steel industry is responsible for 11% of global carbon dioxide emissions, and concrete is the most destructive material on earth: if the cement industry were a country it would be the world’s third largest carbon dioxide emitter after the US and China.In contrast, whole life carbon assessment addresses the embodied and operational impacts of construction processes, including refurbishment, across the spectrum from raw materials extraction through transport, processing, assembly and use to the re-use, recovery and recycling of materials at the end of a building’s life.It also addresses site preparation and facilitation works such as the treatment of hazardous materials and the demolition of existing buildings.The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) published Whole life Carbon Assessment for the Built Environment in 2017. It sets out mandatory principles, regulations and supporting guidance for the interpretation and implementation of the EN 15978 methodology, a European Standard for assessing and reporting the environmental performance of a building which has also been adopted in the UK.The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) then published its guide to the RICS methodology, which it called “the most comprehensive and consistent approach available to the industry”, in 2018, and the UK Green Building Council followed with a framework definition for net zero carbon buildings in 2019. RICS launched its Building Carbon Database later the same year.Construction carbon lifecycle diagram. Image: University of Liverpool Zero Carbon Research Institute.Before RICS introduced this approach the principal method of assessing, rating and certifying the sustainability of buildings in the UK had been BREEAM, which has been in use for as long as Passivhaus.Like the now-withdrawn Code for Sustainable Homes, BREEAM involves assessment against many individual criteria which, when rigorously applied, can achieve much higher environmental standards at more comprehensive scope than the Passivhaus approach.BREEAM is sometimes criticised as being a “tick-box” exercise that can be “gamed” by expert consultants to produce high sustainability scores for projects which may not be merited. It was perceived shortcomings in systems such as BREEAM that prompted RICS to introduce its whole life carbon assessment approach.Nevertheless BREEAM does has the advantage of very widespread adoption. 594,000 buildings have so far been BREEAM-certified in 89 countries, compared with tens of thousands of Passivhaus designs, which are primarily found in German-speaking and Scandinavian countries.And BREEAM is regularly updated to reflect changing industry standards: in 2018 it incorporated elements of the RICS whole life carbon assessment approach.Architect firm Gale &amp;amp; Snowden, which has worked with Exeter City Council on Passivhaus projects for over a decade, describes Passivhaus and BREEAM as complementary approaches, one being an energy performance standard, the other an environmental assessment methodology covering the overall environmental performance of a building.The city council also advocates a combination of the two approaches.However the BREEAM star ratings system only requires a score of 70% to achieve a five star “BREEAM Excellent” rating, such as the one awarded to the university’s Forum building in 2013.A casual observer would be forgiven for presuming that this constituted top marks for sustainability, but the system reserves that accolade for its six star “BREEAM Outstanding” category, which requires a cumulative rating above 85%.Only 1.5% of all buildings meet this standard, and only 0.3% score over 90% on the BREEAM system.The WWF Living Planet Centre in Woking underwent a full whole life carbon assessment, the first for a building of this kind in the UK, and received a “BREEAM Outstanding” rating in 2013.It made extensive use of timber and sourced 98% recycled steel and locally-sourced concrete with high proportions of recycled aggregate by adopting a meticulous approach to materials procurement.However, while a focus on whole life carbon assessment has been perceived as key to achieving a “BREEAM Outstanding” rating since the 2018 update which incorporated elements of the RICS approach, the system had recently permitted very high scores for developments which nevertheless rely on high impact materials such as steel and concrete.A 40,000m2 office building in Amsterdam described at the time as “the greenest building in the world” scored 98.36% in 2016 despite including both.WWF Living Planet Centre. Photo: Number 10 under Creative Commons licenseWhile the Passivhaus approach, as its name suggests, emerged around domestic building design, its use in large projects such as the city council’s St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre has been increasing.In this context, however, it faces the same whole life carbon assessment challenge as BREEAM’s updated scoring system: the difficulties involved in constructing large or tall buildings without relying on intensive use of concrete and steel.Towers at the heights planned for the university’s Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment can be constructed using cross-laminated timber, which has a tiny fraction of cement’s carbon footprint and does not need steel reinforcement.There is an eighteen storey tower in Norway which uses this material to avoid relying on concrete or steel cores or foundations, although it does employ concrete slabs on the top seven floors.However the use of timber in external walls in the UK is controversial because of fire safety, and has been restricted in residential buildings above six storeys by a change in building regulations since the Grenfell Tower fire.Nevertheless, the use of timber and other organic materials which are inherently renewable, have low embodied energy and are easy to reuse or recycle appears to be the optimal route to truly low carbon building construction.The pioneering Enterprise Centre at the University of East Anglia, which was completed six years ago, is often cited as the UK’s greenest building.It has a timber frame, lime render and thatch cladding and is finished with recycled timber, wood wool acoustic boards and wall coverings made from hemp, nettle fabric and reeds.Perhaps most strikingly of all, despite relying on such a high proportion of organic materials it is designed to have a minimum 100 year lifespan.Some of the Clydesdale and Nash Grove accommodation buildings the university is proposing to demolish are less than twenty years old.University of East Anglia Enterprise Centre. Photo: Nik Morris van Leiden under Creative Commons license.The university’s Environment and Climate Emergency Working Group White Paper was published in November 2019, two years after the RICS guidance and six months after the university declared an environment and climate emergency. It says it sets out “what declaring a climate emergency should mean to the University of Exeter”.It draws on the university’s extensive academic climate and environment expertise, as well as professional services staff at all levels, to make more than 100 detailed recommendations covering all the university’s activities.A section on the university’s estates and buildings identifies embedded and emitted carbon and other impacts as significant issues, but while the document mentions whole life analysis five times, all but one instance is focussed on money-saving measures, mostly in the context of saving energy.Another section on the university’s “governance structure, guiding values and accountability” nevertheless says: “At Council, and at all levels of University, the case made for spending carbon on projects should be as clear as the case for spending money, and decisions should reflect this.“To do this the university needs to make tools available (e.g. whole life cycle analysis, environmental footprint tool) to enable decision-making and evaluation of trade-offs related to climate costs.“In this way Vice Chancellor’s Executive Group, Council, academic and professional services staff and students can calculate and compare alternatives or off-setting options.”The white paper also says the university’s “current policy is to construct new buildings to BREEAM Excellent as a minimum standard”, that this should be reviewed with a view to increasing standards, and that BREEAM credits should be mandatory in key areas.It does not mention Passivhaus.University of Exeter Environment and Climate Emergency Working Group white paperBuilding design documents submitted with the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment application refer to the university’s white paper, saying it “makes recommendations for goals and targets, including challenging targets for reductions in carbon emissions”.However the design documents go on, less than a month after the publication of the white paper, to say that the university’s estate team had “determined that adopting the Passivhaus methodology is the best way of achieving these targets”. No account of the basis on which this decision was made is provided.They describe Passivhaus as “an alternative to BREEAM”, despite one being an energy performance standard and the other an assessment methodology covering the overall environmental performance of a building, and claim the university’s white paper said it “would be using the Passivhaus methodology for new build and refurbishment”.They also claim that replacing BREEAM with Passivhaus would mean that “sustainability standards [would be] significantly increased and improved” and say Passivhaus is “a fundamental driver of the design solution” which would provide a basis for “future detailed design”.At a meeting later that month, an Exeter City Council planning officer confirmed that the council “welcomed” this approach.His subsequent report to the council’s planning committee echoed the university’s repeated emphasis that the scheme is “set to be the largest student accommodation project to achieve Passivhaus certification and will be an exemplar project for the university sector” but made no mention of BREEAM or RICS whole life carbon assessment.Then, just under twelve months later, the university published its Environment Climate Emergency Policy Statement. As a higher-level document than the 55 page white paper, at just three pages, it does not mention specific buildings standards.It does, however, say that one of the university’s seven top level policy aims is to “demonstrate compliance with all relevant legislation as a minimum, and where possible go beyond it”. It also says that, by 2025, the university intends to adopt “best practice standards” for “environmental and energy performance of buildings” and “adopt life cycle thinking and analysis in the evaluation of savings to achieve lowest environmental and carbon footprint from our actions and decisions”.University of Exeter Clydesdale Rise student accommodation buildings - earmarked for demolitionWe asked the university whether any whole life carbon or greenhouse gas emissions assessments of the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment had been performed and, if not, on what basis the university is able to make development decisions which are consistent with its policies.We also asked how it reconciles its climate science credentials and sustainability leadership claims, such as those expressed in its recent Green Futures marketing campaign, with development decisions which are not informed by such assessments.It did not answer these questions, instead issuing the following statement: “At the end of May 2021 the University of Exeter received outline planning consent to redevelop student residences in the Clydesdale and Birks areas of the Streatham Campus. It will be one of the largest schemes in the UK to be designed and built to the Passivhaus standard.“To date, the project has concentrated on the successful approval of the outline planning application, which agrees overall maximum developable areas and heights. In the next phase of the project we will explore the detailed internal design, the construction materials that will be used and the overall look of the buildings, including how the low carbon Passivhaus standards will be achieved.”Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment illustrative elevations. Source: University of Exeter.The city council, which is the city’s planning authority, also has climate and environment-related policies regarding the standards which Exeter developments should meet. These are laid out in the Exeter Local Plan, which is amplified by Supplementary Planning Documents and supported by other materials including masterplans.After saying it would upgrade these policies by January this year, it has not done so, and now says it will not do so for another three years.In December 2019 it said it would prepare a Code for Sustainable Homes, just after the university published its Environment and Climate Emergency Working Group White Paper.This Supplementary Planning Document was supposed to set out more detail on how the council expected developers to meet the requirements of three key planning policies which relate to sustainable construction and low carbon energy in new development: CP13, CP14 and CP15. It was understood at the time that this would include raising minimum standards to much higher levels.In particular, it was supposed to clarify core policy CP15, which says: “Proposals for development are expected to demonstrate how sustainable design and construction methods will be incorporated”.CP15 also says: “All non-domestic development will be required to achieve BREEAM ‘Very Good’ standards increasing to ‘Excellent’ standards from 2013. Non-domestic buildings are expected to be zero carbon from 2019.”The Code for Sustainable Homes was scheduled for adoption by January this year, but in May 2020 the council announced that it would stop work on it pending the outcome of the government’s Future Homes Standard consultation on energy efficiency requirements for new buildings.The government consultation finished in February 2020 and the outcome was published in January this year, but until recently the council had nothing to say about it.Exeter City Council offices on Paris StreetEarlier this month, however, the council published a timetable for the production of a new Exeter Local Plan which will replace most of the city’s existing planning policies when it is adopted.The council expects to adopt the new local plan in June 2024, notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the government’s controversial planning reform proposals. This is a remarkably optimistic schedule.Despite the new local plan taking at least three years, the council said it would scrap the planned Code for Sustainable Homes “because the [related] policies will be reviewed as part of the new local plan and because of anticipated changes to the building regulations”.Its statement confirmed that the promised construction standards policy has suffered the same fate as the promised student accommodation and co-living policy which the city council announced in August last year but then chose not to implement during the controversial Harlequins redevelopment planning process.The council also said that policy would have to wait for the new local plan as that is “the appropriate way to develop new policy”.The new local plan has already been delayed by five years by the failed Greater Exeter Strategic Plan. The council could instead have spent this time developing a new Exeter Local Plan, which would almost certainly have been adopted by now, complete with policies requiring high specification whole life carbon assessments for all major development schemes.However there are ways in which the council could have introduced such policies, and still could introduce them, without waiting for the local plan development process and causing further delay while the city’s carbon footprint continues to grow.University of Exeter Clydesdale Court student accommodation buildings - earmarked for demolitionAll planning decisions must take what are known as “material considerations” into account. These do not carry the same weight as fully-fledged local plan policies, but can nevertheless inform development application decisions by council officers and planning committees.The scope of what can constitute material considerations is very wide: they include the National Planning Policy Framework but also include local planning policies, other council policies and other locally-produced documents which are not formal policies. Relevant material considerations also differ for each development proposal.The 2010 University of Exeter Streatham campus masterplan framework is an example of a local planning policy which was relevant in this case. It is this that contains the single sentence (among a hundred pages) which Exeter City Council cited to justify describing the Clydesdale area of the campus as “a brownfield site where re-development is to be expected and encouraged”.The council’s physical activity strategy and its post-COVID economic recovery plan could constitute material considerations in planning decisions, despite not being local planning policies, as could multi-stakeholder documents such as the Greater Exeter industrial strategy and even the “Liveable Exeter” vision document, which is little more than a series of sketches and summary outlines.The weight of material considerations is affected by the weight of evidence supporting the document in question, and the relevance of issues to which it refers. If a document refers to an issue which is material to a particular development application, it could be considered appropriate to include it in decision-making.Manchester City Council, for example, adopted a policy on co-living in the city which it introduced as a material planning consideration on an interim basis despite itself being in the middle of a new local plan development process. The council introduced it simply by approving it at one of its meetings. The policy subsequently helped the council prioritise the city’s interests in deciding applications to build co-living blocks.In the same way, a policy approved by Exeter City Council concerning whole life carbon assessment of construction in the city could become a material consideration in planning decisions, particularly if that policy was supported by substantive evidence.The Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan, which was adopted by the council last year, and the evidence which underpins it, could certainly constitute material consideration in planning decisions to which its content was relevant.There has also been debate in planning policy circles over whether the climate emergency in general could be referenced robustly in planning decisions, although it is not yet clear how much weight such references would have.Nevertheless, when the city council adopted the Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan it did so “as council policy to inform all policy documents, plans and corporate decision making in response to the climate emergency and in pursuance of the goal to make Exeter a carbon neutral city by 2030”, exactly as the city council planning officer said in his report on the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment application.University of Exeter Clydesdale Rise student accommodation buildings - earmarked for demolitionUnfortunately, rather than setting out a commitment to require whole life carbon assessment of all development in the city, or satisfy BREEAM Outstanding criteria, the Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan only says that the city council should “refine local planning policy so that it requires the highest energy efficiency standards (e.g. passive) in all new domestic, industrial, commercial and public buildings”.It says the council should do this by the end of 2022. As CP15 already requires all non-domestic development to be zero carbon, we should presume this aim is intended to apply to domestic buildings. However, as the new Exeter Local Plan timetable recently made clear, the council has no intention of putting such policy in place by the end of next year.And while the Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan also says that the council could “align all statutory and non-statutory plans, policies and guidance (including the local plan and planning policies) with the ambitions of achieving net zero carbon emissions”, it does not say that it should, or define a deadline by when this would need to happen for the city to decarbonise by 2030.The city council nevertheless recently affirmed its commitment to comprehensive policy change by expressing support for the Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill tabled in Parliament by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. (The timing of its declaration, just before May’s local elections, was presumably a coincidence.)Among other things, the bill, which was drafted with the help of James Dyke of the University of Exeter Global Systems Institute, aims to bind the UK to take “every possible step to avoid, limit - and where limiting is not possible - compensate for the adverse impacts of United Kingdom-generated cycles of consumption, trade and production on ecosystems and human health; including, but not limited to, the extraction of raw materials, deforestation, land degradation, pollution and waste production”.The bill is not yet law, but it does offer standards against which the “Exeter Vision 2040”, part of the council’s corporate strategy, might usefully be measured. Including the aim to be “recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”.University of Exeter Nash Grove student accommodation buildings - earmarked for demolitionWe asked the council why no whole life carbon or greenhouse gas emission assessments of the planned Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village redevelopment had been performed.The council said: “There are no local or national planning policy requirements for such assessments at present. We are unaware of any other local planning authorities with adopted policies requiring them, however they are something that will be looked at through the preparation of the new local plan.”The new London Plan, which was adopted by the Greater London Authority in March this year, includes just such a policy. And the adoption of such policies is well under way in councils around the country too.We asked the council how it is able to make planning decisions which are consistent with its policies without such assessments.The council said that planning applications are determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations, which include the National Planning Policy Framework, indicate otherwise.It directed us towards policies CP13, CP14 and CP15 and said that the planning officer’s report on the application addresses both the development plan policies and any other relevant material considerations.It said it “informally” encourages developers to incorporate low carbon and other sustainability principles into their schemes, which it said the university has done in relation to this scheme, and said it “already takes [these] issues seriously”.When asked if it would like to further comment, the council said: “We would reiterate the proactive steps we are taking in striving to be a leading city in delivering sustainable and inclusive growth.“This is repeatedly demonstrated through the council’s own development projects – including the development of St Sidwell’s Point – where the council is clearly leading by example and striving to set the tone for future low carbon developments in the city.”University of Exeter Birks Grange refectory buildings - earmarked for demolitionRather than following its own policy to build at “BREEAM Excellent” or better, reaffirmed by its own academic experts less than a month before its application to redevelop the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village student accommodation sites, the university has chosen to adopt an approach which does not cover most aspects of the environmental performance of a building.Rather than striving to reach the standards required by “BREEAM Outstanding”, or the RICS whole life carbon assessment methodology which RIBA describes as “the most comprehensive and consistent approach available to the industry”, the university appears to be backing away from its aim to adopt “best practice standards” for “environmental and energy performance of buildings” and “life cycle thinking and analysis in the evaluation of savings to achieve lowest environmental and carbon footprint from [its] actions and decisions”.In so doing, the university apparently intends to ignore the impact of demolishing 30 buildings, several of which are less than 20 years old, to build new accommodation blocks at heights which are difficult to construct without extensive use of carbon-intensive concrete and steel.While some of the accommodation blocks on the development site will be refurbished to improve their energy efficiency, no rationale is offered for the decision not to approach all the existing buildings this way, other than the university’s desire to cram another 1,250 student bedrooms into this corner of the Streatham campus.And it is doing all this with the approval of the city council, despite its own local plan policy requirement that all non-domestic development should have met the “BREEAM Excellent” standard since 2013, and been zero carbon since 2019, and the relevant material considerations set out in other council policies.At its June scrutiny meeting the council was asked to explain the extent to which assessments of the embodied carbon emissions from new development, including emissions from demolition of properties on the development site, are taken into account when determining planning applications.Councillor Emma Morse, the portfolio holder for city development, said that the council does not assess the carbon emissions embodied in development. She said the council does not have development plan policies relating to this area of assessment, despite the content of core policy CP15. She also said that there is no national planning policy requirement to make this type of assessment nor any national planning policy guidance relating to it.She did not say that neither the National Planning Policy Framework nor the government’s planning practice guidance prevent local planning authorities setting such standards for development, nor developers meeting such standards in delivery.The portfolio holder was then asked whether the council recognised that the absence of such assessment will make it difficult to achieve the Net Zero Exeter 2030 target. She deferred her answer, then replied in writing, saying that the council “is leading by example in terms of promoting sustainable, high quality development”.University of ExeterDecisions such as these, the detail of which is obscured behind headline claims about the scale and scope of their ambitions, tell us much more about the university’s and city’s priorities in practice than their policies do in principle.As the Committee on Climate Change has just warned, time is running out, and every month of inaction makes it harder to get on track. The UK is neither on course to meet its carbon budgets nor its emissions targets, while irrevocable climate tipping points are approaching much faster than expected and extreme weather events are exceeding worst-case climate science scenarios.Construction is only one of many contexts in which action is needed now. The university is not prevented from taking such action by inadequate council planning policy and should not be prevented from doing so by the indifference of its estates team to its policy commitments. The council is not limited by its failure to introduce needed policy more quickly and should, at least, be enforcing its existing policies.

In many ways the city council’s most significant powers are as local planning authority. Will it, and the university, which professes similarly world-leading climate ambitions, deliver on their existing promises then go further, as they say they will, by striving for the highest possible environmental standards in all development in which they have a hand?The size, scale and impact of the Clydesdale, Nash and Birks Grange Village student accommodation redevelopment makes it an important test of their resolve. The university has the opportunity to bring forward detailed design proposals which go much further than those it submitted at outline application stage, and the city has the opportunity to demand that it does so. Whether either acts will speak volumes about their willingness to practice what they preach."

"content" : "The first community-led Kinder Exeter festival ended on Sunday after a week of online activities and COVID-safe outdoor events in city centre green spaces which explored the theme of “Compassion Through Play”.The festival was a collaboration between the University of Exeter Communities and Students Together Education Incubator programme and Maketank, an artists’ collective which has transformed a vacant three-storey building on Paris Street into a creative, rehearsal and performance space.It was inspired by the Kinder Leeds event which took place last September.Kinder Exeter festival origami workshop in SouthernhayLike Kinder Leeds, Kinder Exeter was based around three core themes: kindness to self, to others and to the planet. The festival aimed to promote compassion and well-being through acts of collaborative play as well as joining with local artists to bring colour to the city’s streets.The event was organised by Olya Petrakova, artistic director and founder of Maketank and a University of Exeter MA Creativity lecturer.She said: “I think artists have a really important job. Our job is to elevate, our job is to transform.“Our job is to give space, give voice, realise moments in life that are very dear to us where we never have time, we never have space, we never have capacity, energy, but that’s what artists do.“I think we are well-being warriors, actually.”Co-organiser Maarten Koeners, a senior lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School, was inspired by his academic research into the effects of play on the human brain to found the Playful University Club, which supports “learning through joy, engagement and play”.He said that by working with Kinder Exeter he hoped to turn his research into something “we really want to experience”.He added: “Along the way, with all the rules and restrictions and society, we sometimes forget how joyful learning is and compassion flows out of it so it’s a very natural connection to make.”University of Exeter drama student “Kindness Ninja” HarryDuring the week-long festival a series of online workshops encouraged participants to break out of their comfort zone and foster kindness through improvisation-based activities.Workshops included “Micro Moments of Positivity”, which invited participants to complete seven acts of caring over seven days, and “Playful Leadership and Kindness”, which explored the ways in which leaders can improve their skills by focusing on empathy.University of Exeter drama student Harry was one of a band of “Kindness Ninjas” who spent the week performing altruistic acts around the city, including litter-picking and giving flowers to strangers.He said he was pleasantly surprised by the response: “It’s something that I’ve learnt a lot [about], that infectious kind of kindness that does get spread when you do a small thing like give someone a flower.”Kinder Exeter community festival on Cathedral GreenThe festival culminated in an outdoor celebration on Saturday, with yoga and an origami workshop for kids and their adults in Southernhay Gardens, followed by a picnic and quiz on Cathedral Green.Trish Oliver, Lord Mayor of Exeter, made a guest appearance at the festival via mobile phone, with her words relayed by a participant through a megaphone.Members of Birmingham theatre company Stan’s Café - performing as parody sports pundit characters “The Commentators” complete with sheepskin jackets and trilby hats – streamed continuous commentary on Saturday’s proceedings live on the festival’s own Compassion Radio webcast.The Commentators, who have previously covered a Scalextric race and the World Gurning Championships, said that while they were disappointed not to have been invited to join their peers in the commentary box at the Euro 2020 football tournament, they were “much happier” broadcasting from the Kinder Exeter festival.Japanese ceremonial drummers Tano Taiko playing beside Exeter CathedralJapanese ceremonial drummers Tano Taiko brought Saturday to a close with a resounding display beside Exeter Cathedral.Maketank’s Olya Petrakova says that Kinder Exeter will become an annual event in the city, and will also take place in other towns in Devon. So far Exmouth and Totnes have both expressed an interest in becoming “Kinder” places."

"content" : "Wealthy countries risk an “unforgivable lost opportunity” by not emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic with newly green economies to address the climate crisis, the United Nations secretary general has warned.Ahead of meeting with the leaders of the world’s major economic powers at the G7 summit in the UK, António Guterres said he was concerned that the richest nations have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than clean energy since the pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery.“I’m more than disappointed, I’m worried about the consequences,” Guterres told the Guardian at the UN headquarters in New York, as part of a Covering Climate Now consortium of interviews alongside NBC News and El Pais. “We need to make sure we reverse the trends, not maintain the trends. It’s now clear we are coming to a point of no return.“To spend these trillions of dollars and not use this occasion to reverse the trends and massively invest in the green economy will be an unforgivable lost opportunity.”UN Secretary General António GuterresA recent analysis showed the G7 countries – the UK, US, Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Japan – have committed $189 billion to support oil, coal and gas, as well as offer financial lifelines to the aviation and automotive sectors, since the outbreak of the coronavirus. This is more than $40 billion more than has been directed towards renewable energy.Several leaders, including the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have stressed the need for the climate crisis to be central to the COVID recovery, with various cities around the world ushering in cyclists and pedestrians to streets previously dominated by cars.But while the G7 countries have agreed to stop the international financing of coal, the world’s wealthiest nations are pouring billions of dollars into developing gas, another fossil fuel, in the global south at a rate four times that of finance supporting wind or solar projects. With economies starting to reopen, planet-heating emissions are expected to jump by the second biggest annual rise in history in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.Guterres said he welcomed the G7 commitment as “many countries are still addicted to coal” but that much more needed to be done in what he called a “make-or-break year” that will be rounded off by crucial UN climate talks in Scotland in November.“We need to abolish subsidies to fossil fuels, this is a central question,” he said. “We have to look at the real costs that exist in the economy, which means a price on carbon. If we do these things, many of the investments made to fossil fuels in the recovery phase will obviously not be profitable. They will be stranded assets with no future.”    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.    Subscribe freeA key priority for the UN secretary general at the G7 summit will be to press leaders on the contentious issue of climate finance. As part of the landmark Paris climate agreement in 2015, rich countries agreed to provide $100bn a year to developing countries to help them adapt to the damaging flooding, drought, heatwaves and other impacts of the climate crisis.This money has never been delivered in full, however, and Guterres said it will be “impossible” to effectively deal with the climate crisis without assistance for poorer countries. He said the G7 will need to deliver the money to “rebuild trust” with developing nations.“The $100 billion is essential,” said the secretary general. “Climate action has until now been centred on mitigation, on reducing emissions. But developing countries have huge problems in adaption from the existing impacts of climate change.”Guterres said he was hopeful that Joe Biden will be able to mobilise other countries to meet commitments on climate aid as the US continues its reintegration into international climate diplomacy following the presidency of Donald Trump.But the US has “a lot of catching up to do”, said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh. “Biden doesn’t get a free pass because it’s the US that caused the damage. If you fail to deliver for the rest of the world that will be our problem and it will come back to bite you.”Scientists recently warned that the world could breach, albeit temporarily, the 1.5°C average temperature increase limit set out in the Paris agreement within the next five years. Guterres, however, said it’s “not only possible, it’s necessary” to strive to avoid global heating above this threshold, beyond which disastrous climate impacts are expected.“We still have time, but we are on the verge,” he said. “When you’re on the verge of the abyss, you need to make sure your next step is in the right direction.”This story originally appeared in The Guardian and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story."

Thanks for subscribing.Feedback is welcome: please feel free to reply to this email or otherwise get in touch with any comments or suggestions you may have.TOP STORIESDEVON PENSION FUND’S FOSSIL FUEL INVESTMENT POSITION EXPOSEDWe follow up on a February report which placed the Devon fund among the country’s largest local government pension fund fossil fuel investors with an assessment of whether Devon County Council’s subsequent decision to pursue a net zero 2050 investment strategy stands up to scrutiny.We found that while shareholder support for Paris Agreement-compatible goals has increased, it has not prevented continuing oil and gas exploration, extraction, production or consumption, undermining the county council’s shareholder activist position, which is also not reflected in its fund manager’s view or voting. Shell and BP, in which the Devon fund has invested nearly £57 million of scheme members’ money, recently held AGMs which illustrate the point.Warnings from climate and sustainability experts and investment analysts that emissions reductions goals will be missed have meanwhile intensified, as Devon County Council welcomes a £38 million Department for Transport road-building grant.

It is now back in front of the Executive on 6 July, but will be discussed in private, with members of the public and press excluded.

Devon Climate Emergency Response Group responded to its consultation findings by questioning whether a 2030 target is “realistic” and suggesting a “compromise position” on a decarbonisation date that “could be palatable to all of the organisations in the Devon Climate Emergency partnership”. This was despite only 13% of consultees supporting the government’s 2050 target.STATISTICS IN THE BALANCEAn examination of Exeter City Council Chief Executive Karime Hassan’s selective use of statistics to prevent the city in flattering light while omitting important information about Exeter’s true economic and environmental position.NOTES &amp;amp; SKETCHESMARKING THEIR OWN HOMEWORKExeter City Council’s ruling Labour group reallocated the city’s committee seats at its annual meeting last week.Council leader Phil Bialyk and executive city development portfolio holder Emma Morse retained their seats on the planning committee in defiance of national guidance from the Local Government Association Planning Advisory Service, and Labour members remain in the chairs of both of the council’s scrutiny committees.FOLLOW THE MONEYGlenn Woodcock and Roli Martin of Global City Futures were invited to join the board which oversees the Devon Carbon Plan at its meeting last month and given the same decision-making powers as the rest of the board, which is almost exclusively composed of public sector organisations.Top of the agenda? A presentation on “innovative approaches to financing projects being explored and trialled as part of the Exeter climate emergency plan”.At the same meeting the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group decided to scrap the planned second Devon Carbon Plan public consultation, pending legal advice, which would mean no further opportunity for the public to respond to revised versions of the plan before it is adopted as policy.

ON THE AGENDANO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REQUIREDAs we go to press Exeter City Council’s planning committee is about to grant the university outline application for an enormous Streatham campus redevelopment between Cowley Bridge Road and Streatham Drive.It involves the demolition of 30 buildings to construct approximately 50,000m2 of new student accommodation, and is half as large again as the 1,200 bedroom East Park development. The city council planning officer’s report is here.The decision will be made alongside a related application to move the university’s estate services centre to the northern edge of the campus. The officer’s report on this is here.NEW EXETER LOCAL PLAN TIMETABLENext Tuesday’s city council Executive meeting will discuss the timetable for delivering the new Exeter Local Plan. An issues consultation is scheduled for this September, a draft consultation for the following September, with publication and hearings in 2023 and adoption in June 2024. The report is here and the scheme here.This is a very ambitious timetable by typical local plan development standards and may well be blown off course by the government’s controversial planning reform bill, which was included in the Queen’s speech a fortnight ago. More developer-friendly detail on this is due from MHCLG soon.GESP REDUXBack in Exeter the initial local plan consultation document is due for approval on 6 July, when the city council Executive will also consider the governance, resourcing and timetable arrangements for the East Devon, Exeter, Mid Devon and Teignbridge Joint Plan before a final decision is taken on 20 July.LIVEABLE EXETER UPDATEAn update on the Liveable Exeter programme, delayed from 1 June, is also expected at the 6 July Executive meeting.ON OUR READING LISTHOW TO REBUILD THE UK ECONOMY IThe Resolution Foundation last week published the launch report of its two year Economy 2030 Inquiry, a collaboration with the LSE and Nuffield Foundation. It considers the context in which the current decade began and outlines the challenges facing the country during the next ten years.It intends to produce economic reform proposals aimed at “strong, sustainable and equitable growth” alongside “significant improvements to people’s living standards and well-being”.Top line: “Commitments to ‘build back better’ gloss over the reality that the pandemic has made many things harder to achieve. They skate over the extent to which path dependency, rather than policy makers’ actions, shape outcomes.“They pretend choices about the UK’s competitive strengths can ignore the reality of a world economy being shaped by China, the EU and the US. And they downplay the very real trade-offs we face as the UK adapts to meet the challenges of the 2020s, and questions of power that determine whose interests prevail.”HOW TO REBUILD THE UK ECONOMY IIOn the other side of the aisle, the Confederation of British Industry this week published its take on what the country should do during the next ten years. Seize the Moment describes six opportunities, which it claims are worth around £700 billion, as “business-led prizes that the UK could capture by 2030”. It also offers recommendations to Government on how to accelerate its plan for growth which is called - yes, you’ve guessed it - “Build Back Better”.PSEPHOLOGY UNLIMITEDUK in a Changing Europe kicked off a week-long Spotlight on British Politics series with a panel including John Curtice, Rob Ford, James Forsyth and Paula Surridge discussing what the 2021 elections mean for our political parties and the state of the union. Warning: this video contains essential insights into the post-Brexit political landscape.NET ZERO WITHOUT NUCLEAR?Veteran sustainability campaigner Jonathan Porritt recently decided to revisit the case for nuclear power to assess what has changed since he last examined the sector in 2012. His personally-authored report offers a very useful primer of the arguments.JOIN US ON OUR MISSIONWhen you join Exeter Observer you don’t just become an active supporter of the public interest journalism that Exeter needs, you become co-owner of a new kind of editorially and financially independent community news organisation.Exeter Observer is owned and managed, researched and written, designed and developed, promoted and distributed by people like you.

"content" : "In February this year a report examining local authority staff pension fund investments found that the Devon Local Government Pension Scheme invests £157 million of its £4 billion fund in fossil fuel companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP, BHP, Anglo American and ExxonMobil.The report found UK local government pension funds held nearly £10 billion worth of investments in oil, gas and coal companies.Shell, BP and BHP account for around 40% of these investments. About two thirds of the funds are invested in oil and gas and about a third in coal. The Devon fund was identified among the largest fossil fuel investors, with nearly 4% of its money invested this way: its largest such holdings are around £36.5 million in Shell and £21 million in BP.Devon Pension Fund currently has more than 39,000 actively contributing members, employed by 214 employers from unitary, district, town and parish councils, education establishments and other bodies in the region. Many of these organisations declared climate emergencies more than two years ago, including Devon County Council and Exeter City Council.Both councils have also since passed formal motions in support of a Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill tabled in Parliament by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas which seeks, among other increases in UK climate policy ambition, an end to the extraction, export and import of fossil fuels.Following the publication of the report, Devon County Council Investment and Pension Fund committee met to discuss Devon Pension Fund’s investment strategy, and its climate change policies in particular.It agreed to sign up to a commitment framed by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, of which Devon County Council is a member, aimed at alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.The commitment includes setting interim investment portfolio carbon reduction targets across all emissions scopes and reducing the net greenhouse gas emissions of the portfolio to zero by 2050 or sooner.The Devon Pension Fund investment strategy also said this included actively “promoting emissions reductions at the companies invested in” but the IIGCC commitment does not contain those words, although it does refer to the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative’s Net Zero Investment Framework which proposes strategic asset allocation, policy advocacy and market engagement among its approaches.The county council subsequently issued a statement summarising the new pension fund climate change investment strategy. Then Councillor Ray Bloxham, who was chair of the council’s investment and pension fund committee at the time, emphasised the strategy’s shareholder activist perspective. He said:“Simply pulling the plug on investing in carbon intensive industries isn’t the answer because they are inextricably linked to the very industries that are working to find sustainable solutions.“To give an example, the steel industry is carbon intensive but is also vital in the production of the wind turbines we need to increase the supply of renewable energy.“To achieve real emissions reductions, it is vital we engage with the companies we are invested in, to hold them to take responsibility for their product throughout its usage, not just in its manufacture.”We asked the county council to clarify these remarks. We were told that collective shareholder pressure aimed at company reduction of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions has more impact than divestment and will do more to tackle climate change.BP petrol station on the Wirral.

She asked what steps were being taken to expedite the changes required by the Devon Pension Fund’s newly agreed commitment “to ensure the utmost expediency in divestment from fossil fuels, as this investment is undermining the Devon Carbon Plan and the opportunity to address and mitigate carbon emissions, and putting Devon County Council investments and pension funds at substantial risk”.Ray Bloxham responded in his then role as chair of the council’s investment and pension fund committee. (He stood down at the May local elections, when Henry Gent won his seat for the Green Party.) He said: “The fund is making a significant contribution towards the climate change agenda and is wholly aligned to the wider aspirations of the council. Disinvestment is not our preferred approach and I firmly believe that disinvestment does not help to respond to climate change one iota.“Disinvestment from the companies listed would not stop those companies from operating but simply remove any influence we have as an influential investor. And we are having an influence. Shell are engaged in research into alternative fuels and BP are very much involved in renewables. Disinvestment would withdraw from that diversification.”We asked the county council to give examples of ways in which specific operational decisions by Shell and BP which have led to measurable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions have been directly influenced by Devon Pension Fund. We were told that shareholder engagement with Shell and BP has had a significant impact on the approach of both companies.London Gateway port with oil pipeline terminal.

In the business community some still like it because it seems to offer, in comparison to other scenarios, a relatively easy way out of the climate crisis. Our analysis shows, however, that there are no easy ways out.”Shell has since published a revised version of what its calls its “energy transition strategy”. It is based on reducing the “carbon intensity” of the energy it produces by diversifying into other activities while modestly decreasing its oil production in favour of expansion of its gas business.However this approach allows continuing high or even increasing greenhouse gas emissions levels while diluting the overall proportion of emissions, meaning the company’s absolute emissions could fall by as little as 10% over the next ten years.Shell gas station in Connecticut. Photo: Wikimedia under a Creative Commons license.Gail Whiteman and Professor Johan Rockström of Stockholm University’s Resilience Centre jointly assessed the changes to Shell’s strategy. They said:“Analysis of the latest plans show the company will attempt to meet its self-declared targets while freezing emissions at more or less the same level as today. In fact, it’s currently forecasting an increase in gas production and gas exports to global markets.“Rather than reducing its emissions, Shell plans to offset gigatonnes of emissions by planting trees to capture carbon. It says that reforestation and other nature-based technology will be enough to allow its expanding operations. But Shell’s Sky scenario requires a forest the size of Brazil to offset the volume of carbon it intends to continue pumping out.“Offsetting carbon emissions with forest growth at this scale is a dangerous fantasy. Science tells us it is simply not possible to substitute carbon emissions from coal, oil and gas, with unstable ‘green’ carbon sinks in trees and soil. While offsetting with nature-based solutions and techniques for carbon dioxide removal is necessary, it should only be used to offset residual, difficult to abate sectors like agriculture and aviation.“Shell sees oil and gas playing a role in our global economy for many decades to come. Science says that is simply not feasible if we want to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.”BP is in a similar position. While it was the first major oil company to truly change course, partly as a result of shareholder pressure, announcing in August last year that it would reduce its oil and gas production by 40% by 2030 (compared to 2019 levels), its “getting to net zero” aims nevertheless rely on the same “carbon intensity” approach taken by Shell.And it only intends to halve the “carbon intensity” of the greenhouse gas emissions from its scope three energy product sales by 2050, which is why the company’s investor-led CA100+ assessment concludes its corporate strategy remains incompatible with the Paris Agreement.BP will start up seven major new hydrocarbon production projects in 2022, with at least three more following in 2023 or later. Even the International Energy Agency, which was established to ensure the energy supplies of rich, industrialised countries in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, has now concluded that all investment in new coal, oil and gas production must cease immediately and all exploitation and development of new oil and gas fields must halt this year.BP petrol station in Barnet Hill. Photo: Wikimedia under a Creative Commons license.But the fossil fuel industry is a global juggernaut that is not so easy to stop.A recent study of Shell, BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil, the top four investor-owned hydrocarbon companies by size of direct and indirect historical greenhouse gas emissions, showed that executive compensation packages directly incentivise continued exploration, extraction and production of fossil fuels as well as promotion of demand for their consumption. Shell’s CEO Ben van Beurden earned more than $23 million from the company in 2018, with his peers close behind.The study also found that the four companies, whose scientists knew that their products contributed to global warming by the late 1970’s or earlier, spent a total of $731 million on lobbying in the US between 1998 and 2019. A 2019 report separately found that the five largest publicly-traded oil and gas majors spent more than $1 billion in the three years following the Paris Agreement on “misleading climate-related branding and lobbying”.Another recent study by a coalition of NGOs found that fossil fuel firms received $3.8 trillion in finance from the world’s banks in the five years following the 2015 Paris Agreement. And a report published this week concluded that UK banks and investors are responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions that nearly double the UK’s annual total, which would make the City of London the ninth biggest carbon emitter in the world if it were a country, ranked higher than Germany.And while the fossil fuel divestment movement has grown significantly in size and influence over the past ten years, has contributed to the social stigmatisation of oil and gas companies and is likely to influence some investment decisions as well as policy-making, there is little conclusive evidence that it has had a direct adverse impact on their share price to earnings ratio, the basis of their market valuations.Despite the conclusions of a joint investigation into the historical financial performance of energy companies  by Imperial College and the International Energy Agency which concluded that investment in renewables generated higher returns than fossil fuels across all portfolios, and presented lower risks in global and advanced economies portfolios, the oil and gas majors would not be more profitable were they to transition overnight to renewables.This is partly because of the high cost barriers which prevent new entrants to the markets which they currently dominate, preventing competition, and partly because their profit margins are much higher than those in the renewable sector. Shell recently posted profits of $3.2 billion for the first quarter of 2021: its CEO said the company was “ideally positioned to benefit” from the world’s recovering demand for fossil fuel.Shell refinery in the Netherlands.

These funds are managed on Devon Pension Fund’s behalf by Legal &amp;amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which directs voting on behalf of the shareholders for which it is responsible. LGIM is Britain’s biggest fund manager, overseeing more than £1.2 trillion of assets. It is accountable to its fund unit holders, including Devon County Council, in respect of such votes.At the BP Annual General Meeting on 12 May, a Dutch fossil fuel industry shareholder activist group called Follow This submitted a resolution which challenged the company to set and publish greenhouse gas emissions targets that are consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement, covering all scopes including its suppliers and the consumption of its energy products.BP’s board recommended that shareholders vote against the resolution, claiming that the company’s existing strategy was Paris Agreement-compliant despite its scope three aim to reduce the “carbon intensity” of the products it sells by just 50% by 2050.LGIM voted with the board and against the Follow This resolution, although the resolution did receive the support of 20.7% of the company’s shareholders, an increase of 12.3% since the 2019 AGM. The activist group’s founder, Mark van Baal, said: “Oil major boards rarely take the initiative to move on their own. The shareholders have to compel them to set targets, and have to support them to attain these targets.”We asked Devon County Council why LGIM did not vote in favour of this resolution on Devon Pensions Fund’s behalf. A spokesperson said that as BP had set targets which “appear consistent” with the Paris Agreement it was “unclear what additional action the company could take”.Then, at the Shell AGM on 18 May, Follow This, which first began co-ordinating investors around these issues at the company’s 2016 AGM, put forward a similar Paris Agreement-aligned resolution in direct challenge to a competing board-proposed resolution supporting the company’s revised “energy transition strategy”.Just over 11% of Shell’s shareholders voted against the board’s strategy, while the Follow This resolution received 30.47% of the votes, its support more than doubling since last year when 14.4% of shareholders voted in favour. In 2016 just 2.7% supported the Follow This motion. Under UK corporate governance rules, winning more than 20% of the votes means that the company is compelled to consult shareholders on the resolution’s content and report back within six months.At this meeting LGIM voted against the board resolution and in favour of the Follow This resolution. It said it did so because it did not believe the company’s plan could “credibly claim alignment with a 1.5°C pathway”. However it said that while it backed the activist group “on this occasion”, it had reservations about its objective of using shareholder activism to turn oil and gas firms into renewable energy companies, saying a strategy of “managed decline” would be an equally viable option.The investment management company’s recommendation for the oil and gas industry is to focus primarily on reducing its own emissions (and production) in line with global climate targets before considering any potential diversification into clean energy.Oil refinery in Pembrokeshire. Photo: Wikimedia.Notwithstanding the differences in position between Devon Pension Fund and its investment manager on shareholder activism in fossil fuel companies, the growing influence of shareholder vote co-ordination groups such as Follow This is evident. As this story went to press ExxonMobil was facing a shareholder rebellion backed by the company’s largest shareholder aimed at dislodging board members, and Chevron shareholders were about to vote on another Follow This resolution aimed at cutting its carbon emissions.However it is nevertheless clear that while increasing support for such interventions has put climate change higher up oil company agendas, both BP and Shell, in which Devon Pension Fund has invested £57 million, are still pursuing corporate strategies that are incompatible with the Paris Agreement.Neither currently plan to become predominantly renewable energy companies, there are limits on the influence their shareholders can bring to bear, their management are both incentivised and obliged to maximise their profits, and the world can no longer wait for them to change course voluntarily.It may be that the only means by which the fossil fuel industry might meet the Paris Agreement targets, at least insofar as the UK can influence it, would be corporate governance reform legislation which forces the City of London into alignment with the government’s professed climate change leadership position.A report published today by risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft suggest that this may be the direction of travel, even though policy-makers currently appear unaware of their destination.It warns that none of the G20 countries are on track to meet their climate goals, and that there is “no longer any realistic chance of an orderly transition” to a low-carbon future for global financial markets because political leaders will be forced to rely on “handbrake” policy interventions to cut emissions.The report’s authors said: “These conditions will leave businesses in carbon-intense sectors facing the most disorderly of transitions to a low-carbon economy, with [restrictive] measures imposed with little warning.“Companies and investors across all asset classes must prepare for at best a disorderly transition and at worst a whiplash from a succession of rapid shifts in policy across a host of vulnerable sectors.”Oil refinery near the River Tees.

Roger Cox, the campaign group’s lawyer said: “This is a turning point in history. This case is unique because it is the first time a judge has ordered a large polluting corporation to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement. This ruling may also have major consequences for other big polluters.”Shell has been ordered to comply with the judgement immediately, but nevertheless plans to appeal against the decision, which will only apply in the Netherlands. However it raises the possibility that similar cases could be brought in other legal jurisdictions if corporations do not comply with the Paris Agreement and governments will not intervene to compel them to do so.UPDATE IIWe have now received confirmation from Devon County Council of how Legal &amp;amp; General Investment Management voted on behalf of Devon Pension Fund at the Chevron and ExxonMobil AGMs which were held after this story went to press.LGIM voted among a 61% majority in favour of the Follow This proposal at the Chevron AGM, which will force the company to reduce its emissions faster than it planned, and in favour of all four reforming ExxonMobil board candidates proposed by activist hedge fund Engine No.1 as well as against the retention of the company’s CEO.Three of the four reforming candidates, who are all experienced oil industry executives, were elected to the board to pursue a profit-oriented, risk-focussed climate action agenda, but CEO Darren Woods retained his position. ExxonMobil is not only one of the world’s biggest contributors to the climate crisis, it is also the world’s greatest single-use plastic waste polluter.Since then Shell CEO Ben van Beurden has issued a defiant statement in which he insisted the company had been playing a leading role in decarbonising the sector, questioned the Hague court ruling and confirmed the company would appeal.He also said that the company expects to continue selling oil and gas products for “a long time to come” and said that it would not help the world “one bit” if Shell “stopped selling petrol and diesel today”. Rather, he said, his company’s customers should “find their own pathways to achieve net-zero emissions” and invited governments to intervene with policies and regulation."

"content" : "A plan to supply the South West Exeter development of 2500 homes with heat from the Marsh Barton waste incinerator which was announced in February this year has been abandoned because most of the property developers involved in the scheme are unwilling to accept modest additional up front costs.Despite Exeter City Council, Teignbridge District Council and Devon County Council agreeing to support the scheme with £3,000 per plot of funding, £7.3 million in total, and house prices in the area rising by £25,000 per plot over the past year, the majority of house builders involved in the development will not consider fronting the remaining £2,000 per plot required for its delivery.The councils had promoted the scheme on the basis it would reduce carbon emissions from the new homes by up to 2,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year, compared with every home instead using gas-fired domestic boilers. This figure does not, however, account for the carbon emissions generated by the waste incinerator, which were nearly 51,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year in 2018 according to the Department for Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy, making the Marsh Barton facility the city’s largest single source of carbon emissions.The proposed district heating network, which would have distributed heat generated by burning rubbish to nearby residential and commercial properties through a system of insulated pipes, would also have needed a new dedicated gas boiler energy centre to top it up which would have consumed nearly 5000MWh of natural gas each year.Devon County Council nevertheless said that the scheme, which it described as “innovative”, was in line with the Government’s commitment to ending the use of fossil fuel heating systems.

It burns 60,000 tonnes of rubbish each year.No consideration appeared to have been given to the possibility of other sources of heat being used to supply the South West Exeter district heating network, which would have committed the city to high impact waste incineration for another thirty years.A wide range of heat sources are used to power the thousands of such heating networks in use around the world, many of which are truly low or zero carbon. These include geothermal and solar energy and heat pumps in a variety of configurations. Denmark is expected to use renewable sources for all its energy by 2050.South West Exeter development map. Source: Devon County Council.The South West Exeter development of 2500 new homes on the Teignbridge edge of Exeter is presented as an extension of Exeter’s suburbs, although 80% of the new homes will come under the jurisdiction of Teignbridge District Council. It will include a school for 1400 pupils, shops and community facilities and will be larger than Exminster.The 90 hectare site, which stretches from Alphington to the M5 with the A379 dividing it in two, is expensive to develop because of its steep topography, existing road layout and proximity to the environmentally important Exe Estuary. 21.5 hectares are allocated as employment land at nearby Peamore.Devon County Council received £55.1 million from the national Housing Infrastructure Fund in February 2019 to pay for new roads and junctions, upgrades to roads, a pedestrian/cycle bridge to cross the A379, a public park and community building and a new electricity substation to help enable site development.The funding is provided as a grant to the county council, which is allowed to reclaim the cost of providing the infrastructure from developers as the housing is built. Once funding is recovered, the county council can use it to support further development sites."

"content" : "Last Thursday’s Exeter local elections produced little change in the city’s political make-up: the city continues to send seven Labour and two Conservative councillors to represent its interests at County Hall and the ruling city council Labour group lost just one seat, to the Green Party.Set against national results in which the Conservatives gained 235 council seats and control of an additional thirteen councils, and Labour lost 326 council seats and control of eight councils, some commentators were quick to identify Exeter as a Labour success story, notwithstanding decisive victories for the party elsewhere, in particular in Liverpool and Manchester’s mayoral elections.After losing in all three city centre wards at the 2019 city council elections, Exeter Labour appeared determined to head off a surge in Green Party support across the city by putting claims about its climate and environment credentials at the centre of its campaign.The tactic appeared to work: while the Green Party’s Amy Sparling won in St David’s, where Labour’s incumbent Robert Lamb was disqualified from the council a fortnight before election day after not attending any of the meetings at which he was expected for six months, Labour held on to all its other seats.Green Party successes elsewhere, notably in Bristol where it won 24 seats to become joint largest party, were not replicated in Exeter, and Labour significantly increased its vote share in Duryard &amp;amp; St James, where Martin Pearce confounded Liberal Democrat hopes of winning three times in a row, and in Pennsylvania, where high-profile pro-nuclear campaigner Zion Lights won a larger share of the vote than council leader Phil Bialyk in her first election.The outcome is that Exeter City Council remains dominated by Labour, as it has been since 2012.However, as always in electoral politics, what happened at the ballot box is a more nuanced story. Particularly as all bar one of the seats being fought over at these elections were last contested in 2016, when all of Exeter’s city councillors were exceptionally elected at the same time following boundary changes.The city previously had two councillors in each of twenty wards from 1979, then a mixture of two or three councillors in each of eighteen wards (also a total of 40) from 1999. The 2016 election was the first under the current arrangement, where three councillors represent each of thirteen wards.Normally one councillor is elected in each ward in each year, with county council elections held in the fourth year. However the 2016 changes meant that all 39 seats had to be elected at the same time, using the multiple non-transferable vote system. The candidate who received the most votes in each ward was elected for a four year term, the runner-up a three year term and the third place candidate a two year term.As a result, the thirteen seats occupied by the most successful 2016 election candidates were contested this year. They would have been contested last year, but the pandemic delayed the ballot, so each of these councillors has ended up serving a five year term. Each new councillor has therefore been elected for a shortened three year term to allow a subsequent return to the usual electoral cycle.This meant that several high-profile councillors were defending their seats. Both Labour and Conservative city council party leaders, Phil Bialyk and Andrew Leadbetter, Labour’s Devon County Council group leader Rob Hannaford and two prominent Labour Executive members, Emma Morse and David Harvey, all stood and were all re-elected.All received a lower share of the vote than they did in 2016, with the exception of David Harvey, who successfully saw off a strong challenge from Conservative John Harvey in Pinhoe, where there has been a close two-way race between the parties for over a decade.This relationship between politician and seat, established at the 2016 election, also made some seats vulnerable when their incumbents stood down. Anne Jobson stepped into David Henson’s shoes to defend St Loye’s for the Conservatives and won, but Olwen Foggin achieved Labour’s biggest vote share there since the boundary changes.In Heavitree, which Olwen Foggin had vacated to fight St Loye’s, Catherine Rees fell just short of a win for the Green Party after increasing its share of the vote by nearly 26%. Barbara Denning won the seat for Labour by sixteen votes with the highest turnout in the city at 46.7%.And in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s support for Richard Branston fell by more than 12% as Dan Grey increased the Green Party’s vote share by more than 30% from 2018, having stood aside for independent community campaigner Jemima Moore in 2019.The Conservatives also improved their vote share in Alphington, Exwick and Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton, although nowhere by a large enough margin to prevent Labour holding the seats, and the Liberal Democrats increased their share in Pennsylvania by nearly 14% but otherwise only polled well in Duryard and St James.Claims that the ward’s 32.45% turnout, the city’s lowest, reflected the absence of many of its large student population and so made it harder for the Liberal Democrats to win, cannot be verified from the available polling data.Exeter Labour’s performance in the city council elections was much more mixed than its loss of a single seat implies. And in the county council elections it lost vote share in seven of nine divisions.The exceptions were in Duryard &amp;amp; Pennsylvania, where Labour increased its vote share by just under 1%, and in Pinhoe &amp;amp; Mincinglake, where the party increased its share by a little over 2%.Exeter Green Party, in contrast, gained the largest increase in vote share in every division in Exeter except Wonford &amp;amp; St Loye’s, apparently demonstrating that Labour’s campaign strategy was more effective at holding increased support for the Green Party at bay in the city council elections than it was in the county council elections.Johanna Korndorfer increased the party’s vote share by more than 12% in St Sidwell’s &amp;amp; St James, Lizzie Woodman by nearly 16% in Heavitree &amp;amp; Whipton Barton, and in St David’s &amp;amp; Haven Banks Andrew Bell won more than twice as many votes as the Conservative candidate, dramatically closing the gap on Labour’s Carol Whitton with a vote share increase of more than 19%.Labour also lost enough ground in Wonford &amp;amp; St Loye’s to allow Conservative city councillor Peter Holland to come within twenty votes of taking the seat from Marina Asvachin.At the same time Conservatives Percy Prowse and Andrew Leadbetter held Duryard &amp;amp; Pennsylvania and Wearside &amp;amp; Topsham comfortably despite losing support in both divisions, again primarily to the Green Party.The Liberal Democrats’ best result was third place in Duryard &amp;amp; Pennsylvania. In every other division they polled fewer votes than the Green Party, coming fifth in Exwick &amp;amp; St Thomas, where they were beaten by For Britain candidate Frankie Rufolo, and in Pinhoe &amp;amp; Mincinglake, where independent community campaigner Kate Jago polled nearly 7% of the vote, only just behind the Green Party, in her first election.Turnout ranged even more widely in the county than city council elections, from 32.0% in St Sidwell’s &amp;amp; St James to 46.7% in Wearside &amp;amp; Topsham. Average turnout in recent English local elections is around 35%, except when there is a general election on the same day, when it typically increases to 64%.UK voter turnout peaked at the 1950 general election, when it was 84%, but the highest turnout of any UK election since the 1918 introduction of universal suffrage was the 84.6% who took part in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence.Many factors contribute to low participation in elections, including mistrust of politicians and the political system, the timing of polls and the “First Past the Post” electoral system, which has numerous disadvantages and is the object of active electoral reform campaigns.15.73% of Exeter’s electorate voted for Labour at last week’s Exeter City Council elections, while 21.48% voted for other parties. Labour nevertheless won eleven seats and the other parties three between them.The 2021 turnout was slightly higher than in 2018 and 2019, but none of the elections held in Exeter using its current ward boundaries have involved more than 45% of the city’s voters.Assessing the representative effectiveness of First Past the Post elections by ignoring non-voting electors reveals similarly skewed seat distributions. At the past four elections Exeter Labour has secured between 36.5% and 47.5% of the ballots cast but has, in every year except 2019, won at least 76.9% of the seats.A fundamental requirement of a democratic electoral system is to accurately represent the views of voters, but First Past the Post often fails to produce this outcome. It doesn’t even guarantee that the party which wins the most votes will win the most seats: in the 1951 UK general election the Labour Party polled nearly a quarter of a million more votes than the Conservatives but won 26 fewer seats, with the Conservatives subsequently forming the government.It also means some seats change hands so rarely that they become “safe” for particular parties, rendering voting preferences in such seats all but irrelevant. Around 60% of Parliament’s 650 seats are in this position, although recent national political realignments have begun to reduce this proportion.It favours large, well-financed, incumbent political parties which are capable of consistently high campaign spending across all electoral areas and are incentivised to resist changes to an electoral system which helps them win power with minority support and helps fund them when in opposition.

The supplementary voting system that was chosen for London’s mayoralty then extended to the election of combined authority mayors elsewhere, as well as regional police and crime commissioners, has provided increased plurality and voter choice in local government since it was introduced.However Home Secretary Priti Patel announced in March that the government plans to replace it with First Past the Post in these contests in future. Conservative Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police &amp;amp; Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez, who was re-elected last week with an increased majority, would nevertheless have won under either system.Methodological note: As the 2016 city council elections were held using the multiple non-transferable vote system each voter was allowed to cast up to three votes, which were not ranked in any order of preference. Because not all voters cast all three of their votes a precise vote share for individual candidates cannot be derived from the recorded results.This also applies to two individual ward elections held since then, in Priory in 2019 and Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton this year, when voters were invited to cast up to two votes to elect two councillors at the same time following the death of Judy Pattison. Naima Allcock received the second largest share of votes cast and was elected for the remaining year of Councillor Pattison’s term.Calculating comparative party vote shares in Exeter City Council elections over time is further complicated because the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats stood aside for independent candidate Jemima Moore in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s in 2019, and then formed a cross-party alliance which led to them standing aside for each other in a total of six wards across the city this year.Consequently, a proportional share of the ballots cast for the leading candidate in each party in each ward in which the party stood has been used to compare party support in the principal city council elections that have taken place since 2016. This is the best available method to enable statistically meaningful comparisons between the major parties in the city. Mid-year by-elections have been excluded.Candidates from other parties, as well as independent candidates, have also stood in each of these elections. UKIP contested most, but not all, of the city’s wards in 2016 and again in 2019, but not in 2018. Bea Gare has represented the Women’s Equality Party at city council elections in Duryard &amp;amp; St James since 2018. These smaller parties and independent candidates have been grouped together to simplify comparison. Where more than one non-major party stood in a multiple non-transferable vote election the best performing candidate was included in the analysis.Devon County Council election vote share comparisons are straightforward as neither the 2017 nor 2021 elections involved more than one candidate from each party standing in each division."

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s ruling Labour group manifesto for tomorrow’s local elections places the council’s current policy of “creating a net zero carbon city by 2030” at the centre of the party’s claims about its capacity to transform the city in the coming years.Council leader Phil Bialyk has pledged that this aim would be “at the heart of everything the council does going forward”.Exeter Labour’s election campaign has also been dominated by claims about its environmental credentials, prompting a war of words with Exeter Green Party, which has presented Labour with a series of challenges on green spaces, air pollution, transport, housing and waste management.However, from the moment Devon County Council adopted its updated 2020-2030 Exeter Transport Strategy in November last year, the only prospective zero in Exeter’s decarbonisation plans became the probability that it would achieve them by 2030.Data: Department for Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy .The county council’s position is that Devon should decarbonise, not by 2030, but by 2050 “at the latest”. It says its “ambitious, but realistic” Exeter Transport Strategy “sets a direction of travel” and “aims to provide a range of travel choices which will manage congestion levels, improve air quality and move towards a low carbon transport system”. But not to arrive at that destination by the end of the decade.Transport is already Exeter’s principal source of greenhouse gas emissions. Its contribution to the city’s carbon footprint actually increased over the ten years until 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available. The council’s “Liveable Exeter” development plan would add a further 28,800 cars to the city’s roads if it were to maintain the parking provision rate of 2.4 cars per household it approved for the development of “zero carbon homes” at Pulling Road in Pinhoe.At the same time the city’s flagship St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre development, for which no environmental impact assessment was performed despite 150 lorry loads of concrete being used in the first phase of building alone, is expected to drive half a million city centre visits each year, many of which seem likely to be encouraged by the free car parking that is proposed for its users.And Devon County Council’s position on decarbonisation remains unchanged despite a recent public consultation on the first draft of the Devon Carbon Plan finding that a majority want net zero by 2030 and only 13% support a 2050 target date.The Devon County Council-led Devon Climate Emergency Response Group (DCERG), which is responsible for the Devon Carbon Plan, says it is intended to “consider the earliest, credible date which should be set for net-zero emissions” which it presents as “2050 at the latest, with an interim target of 50% reduction by 2030”.A report on the consultation response findings to the county council’s Climate Change Standing Overview Group said 2030 was a “popular” target year, but questioned whether it was “realistic”. At subsequent DCERG meetings an unspecified “compromise position” on a decarbonisation date that “could be palatable to all of the organisations in the Devon Climate Emergency partnership” was suggested.A citizens’ assembly due to take place in July will deliberate key issues presented in the first draft of the Devon Carbon Plan. It will nevertheless not be invited to discuss the date for achieving decarbonisation in Devon despite some consultation respondents saying they thought it should.Data: Devon Climate Emergency Response Group.Following these findings, a report by Exeter City Council’s chief executive to the Audit and Governance committee said there was a high risk that the council will be unable to “deliver carbon neutral aspirations for Exeter by 2030”.The report said that Devon County Council’s draft net zero plan was “explicit that net zero cannot be achieved by 2030” and instead aimed for “a 50% reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050” which it said was a “fair reflection of the technical and financial challenges ahead”.It said: “Members may wish to reflect upon this in responding to this particular risk”, adding that a “50% reduction in greenhouse gasses would be an incredible achievement”.At the meeting Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell asked whether Exeter City Council would carry out “an urgent review” of its carbon neutral aspirations.Dave Hodgson, the city council’s finance director, replied: “The aspiration of the council is to deliver carbon neutral by 2030 but it has always been made clear that, from a financial point of view, we required the support of partners both local, regional and, indeed, national in order to deliver this.”He said: “That’s a question for the Executive. Perhaps that’s a question that may be appropriate at [a full meeting of the] council because ultimately, obviously, it will be a councillors’ decision.”The month before the Audit and Governance committee meeting, the council gave advance notice of a report on its “Net Zero Proposals” to be presented at an Executive meeting in April. The report, which was to be heard in private, has since disappeared from the Executive forward plan.The review which accompanied the Audit and Governance committee report identified several potential causes for the delivery failure risk. These included the “political environment”, the “economics of carbon reduction” and “behavioural challenges” as well as “misalignment” with the Devon Carbon Plan.They also included the council’s “technical capability to deliver”, “lack of control over all stakeholders” and “failure to engage with residents and businesses of Exeter to ensure solutions proposed meet real need”.The review identified three “mitigations and controls to be put into place” which included ensuring “clear alignment with D[C]ERG and national climate action plans”, continued investment in “supporting Exeter City Futures” and “national communication positioning Exeter as a leading sustainable city”.We asked Exeter City Council several questions about the review. The council said: “We are a partner with Devon and there is clear alignment”. But when we asked in what ways the city’s carbon reduction aspirations can be clearly aligned with D[C]ERG and national climate action plans without adopting the same target dates, it responded by saying our question was not applicable.We asked about the report on the council’s “Net Zero Proposals” which was scheduled for the Executive’s April meeting but which then disappeared from the Executive forward plan. The council said: “Net Zero 2030 will be discussed at Executive at a date in the future, although it will not be part of the agenda for the April meeting”.A spokesman for the council added: “The council’s 2021-22 budget has been approved. Net Zero 2030 is the council’s priority and the council is working to make this happen within the resources that have been approved by the council’s budget.“This inevitably requires the city council to work with a wide variety of partners in pursuit of the goal. The council’s recovery plan identified the need for a sustainable fund to support our ambitions. The council will continue to make the case for funding to support our ambitions.”    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.    Subscribe freeWhen the DCERG formed in May 2019 it invited public, private and third sector organisations across the county to endorse a Devon Climate Declaration framing their commitment to taking action in response to the climate emergency.All of Devon’s seven other second-tier district and borough councils have so far taken formal decisions to support the declaration as full signatories.Exeter City Council has not. It has however adopted a plan produced by Exeter City Futures which ignores over a million tonnes of carbon emissions generated by the city and massively underestimates the challenges it faces.Meanwhile, despite Parliament passing legislation in June 2019 committing the UK to reaching net zero by 2050, national climate action plans have been criticised for lack of ambition in key areas and are being undermined by recent decisions including cutting domestic air passenger duty and foreign aid, freezing vehicle fuel duty for the eleventh year in a row and axing the flagship green homes grant scheme.The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee says the government does not have a “co-ordinated plan”, the National Audit Office says the UK is currently not on track to meet its targets and the Institute for Government says it has “not yet confronted the scale of the task”.Whether Exeter City Council is about to do so, and whether it will follow national and regional policy leads as a result, will hopefully become clear in the coming months."

Will the Progressive Group of Green, Liberal Democrat and independent councillors build on its cross-party consensus to further challenge Labour’s dominance?There might be trouble for Labour in the suburbs too, where Conservative John Harvey could unseat Labour Executive member David Harvey, and in Pennsylvania where the contest looks wide open.Just don’t confuse Exeter’s John Harvey with comedian Jon Harvey, standing in the London mayoral election this year as “independent space warrior” Count Binface. Although who wouldn’t want a city centre parking policy based on the Monopoly board?WHAT DO WE WANT? NET ZERO! WHEN DO WE WANT IT? 2030!Devon Climate Emergency Response Group responded to its own Devon Carbon Plan consultation finding that a majority want net zero by 2030 by questioning whether a 2030 target is “realistic” and suggesting a “compromise position” on a decarbonisation date that “could be palatable to all of the organisations in the Devon Climate Emergency partnership”. This despite only 13% of consultees supporting the government’s 2050 target.SOARING RHETORIC TO GRACE EXETER GUILDHALL ONCE MOREA case seeking to allow local authority meetings to continue remotely when temporary coronavirus regulations expire next week failed to override the requirement for primary legislation. Exeter City Council will now hold its post-election annual meeting at the Guildhall on 18 May, with Devon County Council doing the same at County Hall on the 27th.REPORT CONFIRMS “RELENTLESS” INTENSIFICATION OF CLIMATE CRISIS2020 is set to be the equal warmest year on record despite cooling La Niña conditions in the Pacific, and the Internal Energy Agency warns that the post-pandemic economic stimulus is expected to drive the second largest annual increase in carbon emissions in history, with UK emissions set to overshoot the country’s 2030 target by 40%.Our Earth Day report was an update on recent research from leading climate monitoring sources.IN CASE YOU MISSED ITTHREE THINGS I LEARNED DURING COVIDA leading climate scientist’s perspective on what the community has learned over the past year about the interactions between the pandemic and the current and future global climate.Exeter Observer has joined the global Covering Climate Now journalism partnership, allowing us to republish stories shared by a network of publishers including The Guardian, Reuters and Bloomberg.LINE OF DUTY?Exeter Observer broke the news that Labour councillor Robert Lamb was disqualified from representing St David’s ward on Exeter City Council after attending none of the council meetings at which he was expected over the previous six months.Had Exeter City Council not postponed the full council meeting it had scheduled for 20 April, Councillor Lamb might have logged in and kept his position for the final weeks of his term.ISN’T THE LUXURY ACCOMMODATION ENOUGH?We noticed a freedom of information request submitted via WhatDoTheyKnow asking the university how much it spends on advertising and marketing.

Planning officer’s report here, full application details here.NEWTOWN CONSULTATION ENDS TOMORROW!Newtown residents are invited to tell Exeter City Council and Devon County Council how they would like to see their neighbourhood improved. The consultation emphasis is on increasing “active travel” although it offers scope to comment on a range of issues including public spaces, parking, play and recreation and the wider community. Have your say here. The survey will inform proposals which will come forward during the summer.NORTHBROOK APPROACH CONSULTATION ENDS NEXT WEEKAfter backtracking on its plans to redevelop the golf course (which closed in 2019) into housing, the city council now wants community views on the site’s future. The council’s draft Parks and Green Spaces strategy mentions “sponsorship and commercial opportunities” as “alternatives to traditional revenue funding”. Have your say here, but only until 3 May.NEW EXETER LOCAL PLAN ON ITS WAYA Local Development Scheme report (essentially a timetable for the new local plan) is due on 1 June, then a Local Plan initial consultation document is due for approval a month later, on 6 July.The governance, resourcing and timetable arrangements for the East Devon, Exeter. Mid Devon and Teignbridge Joint Plan (aka GESP Redux) are also due on 6 July, for a final decision on 20 July by full council.LIVEABLE EXETER UPDATEAn update on the Liveable Exeter programme is also due to be presented at the Executive meeting on 1 June.

They were and still are driven by a need to protect business as usual, not the climate. If we want to keep people safe then large and sustained cuts to carbon emissions need to happen now. That is the very simple acid test that must be applied to all climate policies. The time for wishful thinking is over.”REFORMING FREEDOM OF INFORMATIONmySociety’s latest research report proposing improvements to strengthen access to information in the UK. PDF here.LAST WORDSO MANY QUESTIONS …Quote of the week must surely go to Exeter City Council leader Phil Bialyk for: “Sorry, chair, I just need to refer to some of my other notes, if you’ll just bear with me”.It followed two long minutes at Exeter City Council’s Tuesday evening meeting in which Councillor Bialyk read out a scripted statement on the council’s willingness to use green space beside the river for development in answer to a completely different question.It was only when he turned the page that he noticed his mistake (but still seemed to miss the amusement among his colleagues).The question? From Exeter Observer contributing editor Peter Cleasby: “Since the council has failed to respond to repeated questioning from Exeter Observer on the topic, will the leader of the council please explain why the Church of England has two representatives on the Liveable Exeter Place Board while other faiths and churches have none?”Unfortunately, when Councillor Bialyk did find the correct script he still failed to provide an answer."

"content" : "An initial summary of public consultation responses to the first draft of the Devon Carbon Plan has found a clear majority in favour of a 2030 target date for Devon decarbonisation.The consultation on the Devon Carbon Plan draft, which ran from 7 December 2020 to 15 February 2021, received 1,321 responses from individuals and a variety of organisations across the county.51% of respondents said 2030 should be the date by when the county should achieve “net zero” carbon emissions, with some commenting that the urgency of the situation required rising to the challenges involved in achieving this aim.Just 13% of the survey’s respondents support the UK government’s 2050 target date. Devon County Council’s current policy is that the county should decarbonise by 2050 “at the latest”.A report on the consultation response findings to the county council’s Climate Change Standing Overview Group said 2030 was a “popular” target year, but asked whether it was “realistic”. It nevertheless said as “early-as-possible should be incentivised” and highlighted “a risk of being too focused on a number” saying a “rapid initial carbon reduction” is more important.At subsequent meetings an unspecified “compromise position” on a decarbonisation date that “could be palatable to all of the organisations in the Devon Climate Emergency partnership” was suggested.Interim Devon Carbon Plan consultation responses net zero target date preferences. Data: Devon Climate Emergency Response Group.The consultation’s 1,321 responses represent just over 0.11% of Devon’s population, although this was more than the 893 responses to the public call for evidence for the plan which took place in Autumn 2019.Only around 45% were responses to the full-length 45 minute consultation questionnaire: the rest were responses to a brief ten minute survey. Some respondents said they were concerned by the length of the questionnaire, others commented they were pleased with its comprehensive scope.Responses came from residents in all local authority areas in Devon, with only Plymouth under-represented, and organisations including political parties, environmental campaign groups, businesses, educational institutions and county, district, town and parish councils.Nine webinars were held during the consultation period at which attendance varied between 50 and more than 100.51% of individual respondents were female, 44% male and the remainder “other” or “preferred not to say”, reflecting Devon’s gender demographics. 32% were from individuals over 65 years of age while younger people were under-represented despite a targeted social media campaign aimed at reaching these age groups.Interim Devon Carbon Plan consultation respondent age group proportions. Data: Devon Climate Emergency Response Group.The consultation also invited respondents to determine which of six questions laid out in the first draft of the Devon Carbon Plan should be prioritised for discussion at a citizens’ assembly of 70 Devon residents due to be held in July.The questions are:  How should Devon’s landscapes evolve in ways that positively support achieving net-zero and that are beneficial to their special qualities?  The Committee on Climate Change scenarios for achieving net-zero require a 20% reduction in beef, lamb and dairy consumption nationally. What does this mean for Devon?  What is the role of reducing road capacity in reducing traffic, and is it appropriate for Devon?  To what extent should financial incentives and legislation be used to accelerate the retrofitting of buildings with energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies?  What is the role of onshore wind energy in the Devon Renewable Energy Strategy? How can tensions between the support for onshore wind energy in theory and practice be reduced?  To what extent would the use of financial mechanisms be acceptable to Devon’s citizens to help discourage activities that generate emissions and to fund emissions reduction?Despite intending to determine which three of these issues should be prioritised if the citizens’ assembly does not have time to deliberate them all, the consultation found near-equal interest in all six, with a slight emphasis in favour of discussion around food and farming.The assembly will consist of a total of 24 hours of deliberation spread across several days. The 70 participants are expected to be demographically and attitudinally representative of the population of Devon.The citizens’ assembly will not be invited to discuss the date for achieving decarbonisation in Devon, despite some consultation respondents saying they thought it should.Nor will it be invited to consider the Devon Carbon Plan’s dependence on carbon offsetting despite its increasing significance in climate policy-making.

It is not clear whether detailed findings from the public consultation will be published as part of this process.The plan’s authors do not, however, intend to update its emissions reduction trajectory in response to the UK government’s recently announced revised target of reducing 1990 greenhouse gas levels by 78% by 2035, despite this target exceeding the Devon Carbon Plan aim of reducing 2010 emissions by 50% by 2035.Similarly, the announcement that the UK’s share of international aviation and shipping emissions would be included in national emissions reduction measures for the first time will not lead to significant changes in the Devon plan because aviation is “thought to be less than 1% of Devon’s emissions”.Original Devon Carbon Plan development timetable. Source: Devon Climate Emergency Response Group.A second public consultation, on the revised draft of the Devon Carbon Plan, was expected before a final version was agreed. However it now appears that this second public consultation has been scrapped, in which case the revised draft will go straight to partner organisations for approval.This is one of several compromises that have been made to compensate for slippage in the plan development timetable, which originally intended the citizens’ assembly to begin in January last year with the final plan to be produced in September and approved during October and November.Before the decision to scrap the second public consultation the plan delivery timetable was two years and two months behind schedule. Even with this change the Devon Carbon Plan is not expected to take effect until April 2022, three years after Devon County Council convened the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group."

But that legislation expires next Thursday, on the day of the local elections.A survey by the Local Government Association found that four in five councils wanted to carry on holding remote meetings after the coronavirus pandemic.The Local Government Chronicle reported that councils were concerned that they would have to use larger venues in order to maintain social distancing, generating extra costs or obliging them to limit attendance.However despite calls from the local government sector to permit councils to meet virtually beyond 6 May, and the Labour Party offering to help find the parliamentary time to pass the necessary legislation, the government decided against extending the regulations last month.Local government minister Luke Hall said: “While local authorities have been able to hold meetings in person at any time during the pandemic with appropriate measures in place, the successful rollout of the vaccine and the reduction in cases of COVID-19 should result in a significant reduction in risk for local authority members meeting in person from 7 May”.He said while he recognised there may be concerns about holding face-to-face meetings, “ultimately it is for local authorities to apply the COVID-19 guidance to ensure meetings take place safely”.Addressing council leaders, he added: “While you do have a legal obligation to ensure that members of the public can access most of your meetings, I would encourage you to continue to provide remote access to minimise the need for the public to attend meetings physically until at least 21 June, at which point it is anticipated that all restrictions on indoor gatherings will have been lifted in line with the roadmap.”Alan Connett, Devon County Council Liberal Democrat group leader, said: “Making large groups of people meet indoors for meetings which often last more than two hours, when we’re trying to stop the spread of COVID-19, is unbelievably daft.“This affects councillors and council staff. Some may have had COVID jabs, some not and some may have clinically vulnerable family at home.“It should be up to our local councils to decide when it is safe to return - not the Conservative government.”    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.    Subscribe freeThe High Court ruling from Dame Victoria Sharp and Mr Justice Chamberlain acknowledged that the issue is contentious: “The decision whether to permit some or all local authority meetings to be conducted remotely, and if so, how and subject to what safeguards, involves difficult policy choices on which there is likely to be a range of competing views.However it was clear that such a decision would require primary legislation: “These choices have been made legislatively for Scotland by the Scottish Parliament and for Wales by the Senedd. In England, they are for Parliament, not the courts.”James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association (who is also a Conservative councillor) described the decision as “very disappointing”, adding that councils “will now have to use very large external venues to allow all members of the council to meet in person”.Despite indoor coronavirus restrictions continuing until 21 June, and MPs being able to attend Parliament remotely until then, councils are required by law to hold annual meetings within 21 days of the local elections on 6 May.Exeter City Council’s annual meeting of 39 members plus officials is accordingly now scheduled to take place in the Guildhall on 18 May and Devon County Council’s annual meeting of 60 members plus officials is scheduled to take place in the council chamber at County Hall on 27 May.Meetings of all other local councils, including the Dartmoor and Exmoor national park authorities, Devon and Somerset Fire Authority, the Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police and Crime Panel and all parish and town councils are also affected by the decision.UPDATE – 4 May 2021Exeter City Council is considering holding its annual meeting on 18 May at Exeter Corn Exchange, instead of the Guildhall, and Devon County Council is considering holding is annual meeting on 27 May at Sandy Park instead of County Hall."

"content" : "On 6 May Exeter’s electors will go to the polls to elect councillors to represent them on the city and county councils and to help choose the Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner.Fourteen of the city’s 39 council seats and all nine of its county council seats are being contested. As the city council and police and crime commissioner elections should have been held in May 2020 but were delayed due to the pandemic they are instead taking place at the same time as the scheduled 2021 county council elections.On the same day Plymouth City Council will also hold elections and there will be by-elections in East Devon, South Hams, Mid Devon and Torbay. 30 parish and town council seats across the county will be contested and referendums on thirteen Neighbourhood Plans will take place.5,000 councillors in 145 local authorities will be elected at district, borough, county borough, county and unitary level in every region of England apart from Greater London. Elections for thirteen directly-elected mayors in England, 39 police and crime commissioners in England and Wales, all 60 members of Senedd Cymru and all 129 members of the Scottish Parliament will also take place, as will those for the 25 members of the London Assembly and the Mayor of London.The Hartlepool parliamentary by-election  will also be held on 6 May, the first by-election since the Conservatives won an 87 seat majority at the 2019 parliamentary election. Labour appears to be at risk of losing the seat after holding it since 1964.

Exeter City Council electionsExeter City Council’s 39 councillors are equally distributed across 13 wards, three in each ward. They have been arranged this way since boundary changes prompted the exceptional election of the whole council at the same time in 2016.A third of the seats, one in each ward, is normally contested in each of three years, with county council elections then held in the fourth year. Each city councillor thus normally serves a four year term.However the 2016 elections used the multiple non-transferable vote system to allow the council to return to electing by thirds in 2018. Voters cast up to three votes, with the candidate who received the most votes in each ward serving a four year term, the runner-up a three year term and the third place candidate a two year term.The thirteen Exeter City Council seats occupied by the councillors who gained the most votes in the 2016 local elections are being contested this year. These councillors would have served a four year term but have ended up serving a five year term because the pandemic delayed last year’s ballot. Each new councillor will be therefore be elected for a shortened three year term to allow a subsequent return to the usual electoral cycle.Voters in the city’s Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton ward will also elect an additional councillor, following the death of Councillor Judy Pattison. The candidate in that ward who receives the most votes will serve a three year term and the runner-up the remaining year of Councillor Pattison’s term.2016 Exeter City Council election results. Source Wikipedia under Creative Commons license.Labour is, in effect, defending twelve of the fourteen seats that are being contested this year, and the Conservatives two. However the situation is less straightforward than it seems.Rachel Lyons, who was first elected as an Exeter city councillor more than twenty years ago, recently eschewed the Labour Party, since when she has been designated as an Independent. She is not standing for re-election in Pennsylvania.Olwen Foggin is also standing down, in Heavitree, which she has held for Labour since 2014. She will instead contest St Loyes, a Conservative stronghold for the past decade where all three ward councillors currently represent the party. David Henson, who was first elected in 1983, is standing down. Anne Jobson hopes to successfully defend the seat.Robert Lamb, the Labour candidate who gained the most votes in St Thomas in 2016 and was thus elected to serve for four years, was disqualified from the city council last Wednesday after not attending any of the meetings at which he was expected for six months. He was absent without submitting apologies from thirteen of seventeen meetings at which he was expected in the past year, and had an attendance record of 39% the previous year.The runner-up in St David’s in 2016, a Labour candidate who was elected to serve a three year term, also subsequently stopped attending almost all of the council meetings at which he was expected after moving to London in 2018.And Keith Owen, who was first elected as an Exeter Labour city councillor in 2012, is standing down in Duryard &amp;amp; St James, where Exeter Liberal Democrats have won both of the past two elections, in 2018 and 2019.At the last city council elections in 2019 all three city centre wards went to challengers. Michael Mitchell won Duryard &amp;amp; St James for the Liberal Democrats and community campaigner Jemima Moore won in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s, standing as an Independent after the city council closed Clifton Hill sports centre and earmarked the site for redevelopment.At the same time Diana Moore won St David’s for Exeter Green Party by a country mile, polling the largest number of votes of any candidate standing in any ward (1455), the largest margin of victory across the city (659 votes) and the city’s largest vote share (55%).These three subsequently formed the Progressive Group on Exeter City Council with Kevin Mitchell, who had held Duryard &amp;amp; St James for the Liberal Democrats the previous year, as group leader. Since then they have together presented much of the effective opposition to Exeter City Council’s ruling Labour group, despite the Conservative group holding six seats to their four.The Progressive Group has since decided to build on its cross-party consensus by standing uncontested by each other in six wards across the city. As a result Amy Sparling is standing in St David’s, Catherine Rees in Heavitree and Dan Grey in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s (with Jemima Moore’s endorsement) for Exeter Green Party, and Will Aczel is standing in Duryard &amp;amp; St James, Nigel Williams in Pennsylvania and Adrian Fullam, a previous Exeter City Council leader, in St Thomas for the Liberal Democrats.Both parties have agreed to field candidates in all divisions in the Devon County Council elections so all voters who wish to can vote for each of them at these elections.Exeter City Council electoral wards. Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2019Elsewhere in the city, Conservative John Harvey is standing against Labour Executive member David Harvey (no relation) in Pinhoe, where there has been a close two-way race between the parties for over a decade. In 2019 Labour’s Trish Oliver beat Conservative Cynthia Thompson by just 15 votes, a margin of 0.6%. The previous year Labour’s Duncan Wood beat Conservative Keith Sparkes by 71 votes.In 2016, when all three seats were elected at the same time, Labour took two and the Conservatives one, with less than a hundred votes separating all three winning candidates. In a by-election the previous year Conservative Cynthia Thompson beat Labour’s David Harvey by just six votes. In 2010 it was even tighter: four votes won the seat for Labour.Pinhoe may turn out to be the closest contest in the city: Pennsylvania may be the most open. None of the candidates in the ward have previously been Exeter city councillors. The Liberal Democrats won there in 2010, the Conservatives in 2012 and 2014 and Labour in 2018 and 2019.Meanwhile the sole Women’s Equality Party candidate in Exeter at these elections, Bea Gare, is standing in Duryard &amp;amp; St James, and both Labour and Conservative leaders are defending their seats, Phil Bialyk in Exwick and Andrew Leadbetter in Topsham.A full list of candidates is available via the city council website. Exeter City Council Conservative, Green, Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos are available online.2017 Devon County Council election results. Source Wikipedia under Creative Commons license.Exeter Labour only needs to win two of the fourteen city council seats being contested at these elections to retain control of Exeter City Council as it already holds eighteen of the other 25 seats.This makes it all but inevitable that Exeter City Council will shortly meet the Electoral Reform Society’s definition of a “one party council”, having been overwhelmingly controlled by the same political party since 2012.Academic research has shown that this “weak electoral accountability” greatly increases the likelihood of corruption, cronyism and spending decisions which offer poor value for public money.Devon County Council has been a one party council, under the same leader, since 2009. Its current composition is 42 Conservative, seven Labour, six Liberal Democrat, two Independent, one Green Party, one East Devon Alliance and one North Devon Liberal member, following the 2017 elections before which boundary changes also took place.Devon County Council electionsElections for all 60 members of Devon County Council will also take place on 6 May. 56 of these councillors represent single-member divisions and four represent divisions which have two councillors each: Broadclyst and Exmouth.There are nine Devon County Council electoral divisions in Exeter, each of which roughly maps onto two city council electoral wards. Exeter City Council is administering all the elections that are taking place in the city on 6 May, so notices including details of nominated candidates and their agents are published on its website for both city council and county council elections.Like Rachel Lyons, Greg Sheldon is standing down in Heavitree &amp;amp; Whipton Barton, having won a by-election there by just 40 votes in 2019 after Labour support collapsed in what had been a party stronghold. Conservative John Harvey came a close second, with Labour’s lost votes being divided equally between Liberal Democrat and Green candidates. Danny Barnes is hoping to hold the seat for Labour at these elections.At the same time as contesting the Pinhoe city council ward, John Harvey is standing in Pinhoe &amp;amp; Mincinglake, where Labour’s Hilary Ackland is standing down and Tracy Adams is standing in her place. Local community organiser Kate Jago is also contesting the division as an Independent.Labour is defending seven of the city’s nine county divisions, including Exwick &amp;amp; St Thomas where Rob Hannaford, Labour group leader at county hall, won a majority of more than 1300 votes in 2017. Andrew Leadbetter, Conservative group leader on Exeter City Council, is defending his county council seat in Wearside &amp;amp; Topsham, and Conservative Percy Prowse is defending Duryard &amp;amp; Pennsylvania, where Bea Gare is also standing for the Women’s Equality Party.A full list of candidates for the Devon County Council elections in Exeter is available via the city council website. Devon County Council Conservative, Green, Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos are available online.Devon County Council Exeter electoral divisions. Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2019Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police and Crime commissioner electionsThe regional police and crime commissioner will also be elected on 6 May, by up to 1.3 million electors across twelve local authorities in Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. They will serve a shortened three year term on the same basis as the Exeter city councillors elected that day.Unlike the city and county council elections, police and crime commissioner elections are decided using the supplementary vote system, provided there are more than two candidates.Under this system, ballot papers present two columns of boxes alongside the candidates’ names. One column is for voters to mark their first choice candidate and the other a second choice. For the vote to be counted the elector must cast a first choice vote. In the second column the elector may also mark a cross next to their second choice candidate.If a candidate receives more than 50%+1 of the first choice votes they are declared the winner. Otherwise the two candidates who achieve the highest number of first choice votes progress to a second stage in which the second choice votes from the ballot papers of candidates who have been eliminated after the first round of voting are then counted for the remaining two candidates.The winning candidate is then the one with the highest number of votes after adding first and second choice votes together.This is what happened at the last Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall police and crime commissioner elections in 2016. There was no outright winner after all the first choise votes had been counted, so Conservative Alison Hernandez and Labour’s Gareth Derrick progressed to a second round in which more than 42,000 first choice votes which had been cast for four other candidates were redistributed on the basis of second choice preferences.Alison Hernandez then won by a margin of 3794 votes, with 51.1% of the total against Gareth Derrick’s 48.9%.Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police and Crime commissioner election results 2016. Image: Wikipedia under Creative Commons licenseAlison Hernandez and Gareth Derrick, who is also a Plymouth city councillor, are both standing again at these elections, as are Liberal Democrat Brian Blake and Stuart Jackson of the Green Party. Election statements by each candidate are available on the Choose My PCC website and election notices including details of nominated candidates and their agents are published by Exeter City Council, which is taking overall responsibility for co-ordinating this election and announcing its results.Regional police and crime commissioners are paid a salary of £86,700 per annum, a rate set by the Home Secretary, which is nearly £5,000 a year more than an MP’s basic salary, although MPs enjoy very generous expenses allowances and ministers receive considerably more.Unlike the city and county council elections, in which deposits are not required to stand, candidates for police and crime commissioner must pay a £5,000 deposit which is returnable only if they poll at least 5% of the total number of valid first preference votes cast.Five candidates failed to meet this threshold in 2016, in Hampshire, Kent, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and West Yorkshire.  Regressive electoral reform?  Home Secretary Priti Patel recently announced that future elections for police and crime commissioners will take place using the first past the post system no matter how many candidates stand.  She claims the change reflects the 2011 national referendum which “rejected” transferable voting systems and will make police and crime commissioners “more accountable to the communities they serve”.  A white paper is due later this year, which is also expected to recommend the transfer of governance of fire and rescue services to police and crime commissioners.Election safetyMany local councils previously expressed doubts over whether it would be possible to hold these elections during the coronavirus pandemic.The Government subsequently defined new rules to enable them to go ahead and the NHS coronavirus vaccination programme met its target of offering all adults over 50 years of age and others in priority groups their first jab by 15 April, three weeks before polling day.The government then announced that previously planned restrictions on outdoor election campaigning, including door to door canvassing, would be relaxed from 8 March in step with its planned changes to lockdown rules.Then from 29 March, the same day as the “rule of six” returned, election canvassing was allowed to follow the same pattern, so groups of up to six campaign activists from different households could work together outdoors.As there has been no change to the rules on meeting others indoors, doorstep campaigning activity must continue to take place on a one-to-one basis. The guidance also stipulates that campaigners should not collect postal ballots from electors for submission or transport electors to or from polling stations in private vehicles.Guidance intended to make polling stations safe has also been published. People are encouraged to take their own pen or pencil to mark ballot papers. Masks must be worn on the same basis as in any indoor public place and social distancing guidelines must be similarly followed.Hand sanitiser will be available and, where appropriate, screens and distance markings will be used inside polling stations, which will be cleaned regularly and ventilated as much as possible.All Exeter’s main political parties have agreed not to site tellers at polling stations this year. Tellers are party volunteers who usually wait outside polling stations to collect poll numbers of voters as they enter or leave to check whether their party’s expectations about the turnout of their vote in particular wards are being met.Tellers play no official part in elections and voters are not obliged to speak to them: doing so is entirely voluntary.How to voteYou must be on the electoral register in order to vote and the choice between voting in person and voting by postal or proxy vote remains as normal.A significant increase from the nearly one in five votes that are usually cast by post in local elections was expected, but only around 17% of Exeter’s voters have taken up this option.Voter registration for these elections closed last Monday and applications for new postal votes and routine changes to existing postal and proxy votes closed the following day.It nevertheless remains possible to submit a new application to vote by proxy (via an appointed person who must also be eligible to vote) until 5pm on Tuesday 27 April.A form must be downloaded, completed and posted to the city council electoral service so that it arrives before the deadline passes.You can also send scanned forms by email to electoral.services@exeter.gov.uk. The city council electoral service will post forms on request to those who cannot print them.Anyone who needs to self-isolate because of coronavirus can also request a proxy vote up to 5pm on polling day itself by contacting the city council electoral services team by email or telephone on 01392 265141.This also applies to existing proxy arrangements: voters can appoint a new proxy up to the same deadline if their proxy is unable to vote on their behalf because of COVID-19. Such applications do not require medical attestation.Applications for replacement spoilt or lost postal votes can also be submitted until 5pm on polling day.On 6 May 55 polling stations will be open from 7am to 10pm across Exeter, including a pub and thirteen schools, several of which will remain open to pupils.Everyone who is on the electoral register should receive a poll card which says where their polling station is located. Voters can only cast their ballots at the polling station specified on this card.The location of Exeter polling stations can also be found by postcode search.Any voter who arrives at their polling station before 10pm and is in a queue waiting to vote at 10pm will be able to vote.On entering the polling station you or your proxy can show your poll card to the staff, or tell them your name and address instead.Despite popular perception to the contrary you do not need a poll card to vote, provided you are on the electoral register, nor do you need to provide any personal identification to do so.You will then receive ballot papers on which you can cast your vote(s) by marking a cross next to the candidate(s) you want to support in one of the available polling booths, before folding your ballot paper and placing it in a ballot box.The colour of the ballot papers for each of the elections will differ.Postal votes must be returned by 10pm on polling day either by post or by hand to any polling station in the same voting area.  Mandatory voter photo ID?  The government is currently proposing to bring forward a bill after these elections which will make photographic identification mandatory for all English and UK-wide elections from 2023.  There was only a single conviction for voter “personation” after the 2019 elections, millions of people in the UK do not possess any recognised photographic identification documents and the new system would cost up to £18 million per election.  Most cases of electoral fraud reported to the police concern campaigning offences committed by political parties.  When all Exeter’s polling stations have closed, the city’s ballot boxes will be taken to the Riverside Leisure Centre so ballot papers can be verified and votes counted.This year the counts will not start until the day after the vote, with the county council count in the morning and the city council count in the afternoon.Police and crime commissioner counts will begin at different times in different parts of Devon and Cornwall. The Exeter count will take place on the morning of Monday 10 May with the full regional results to be announced in Exeter on Monday afternoon by the city council’s returning officer.Limits on the number of people allowed at the counts have been imposed, with only electoral staff, candidates and their agents permitted in the main hall. The city council will live stream the counts and the results declarations via its Facebook page.Records of previous elections held in the city are also published by the city council."

"content" : "The United Nations World Meteorological Organization State of the Global Climate report for 2020 confirms that there was a “relentless” intensification of the climate crisis last year, despite the temporary dip in carbon emissions due to coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, which had no discernible impact on atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.The report said that despite developing La Niña conditions, which cool the sea surface temperature across parts of the Pacific Ocean, global mean temperature in 2020 is expected to be one of the three warmest on record making the past six years, including 2020, the six hottest ever. The global average temperature was about 1.2°C above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) level, just 0.3°C below the target limit agreed in Paris in 2015.United Nations Secetary-General António Guterres said 2021 would be “the make it or break it year”, adding that 2020 had been another unprecedented year of extreme weather and climate disasters. He added: “We are on the verge of the abyss”.The annual report, which the World Meteorological Organization has issued since 1993, includes input from national meterological services including the Met Office.It is accompanied by a story map which shows details of key climate indicators, including record greenhouse gas concentrations, increasing land and ocean temperatures, sea level rise, melting ice and glacier retreat and extreme weather. The map also highlights impacts on socio-economic development, migration and displacement, food security and land and marine ecosystems.World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Professor Petteri Taalas said: “The key climate indicators provided in this report highlight relentless, continuing climate change, and the severe losses and damage associated with extreme weather events, affecting people, societies and economies.”2020 global mean temperature difference from 1850-1900. Image: © Met Office.Meanwhile the International Energy Agency’s annual Global Energy Review has predicted that carbon emissions will rise by the second largest annual increase in history during 2021, driven by economic policy responses to the coronavirus pandemic.Global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are expected to rise by almost 5% to 33 billion tonnes in 2021, mainly because of a strong rebound in demand for coal for use in electricity generation. The expected rise in coal use dwarfs that of renewables, despite accelerating demand, by almost 60%.This year’s emissions increase will be second only to the rise that took place during 2010 following the global financial crisis.Both reports comes as a global leaders summit convened by US President Joe Biden meets and the UK prepares to host the COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow in November.International Energy Agency Executive Director Faith Birol said: “Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022.“The Leaders Summit on Climate hosted by US President Joe Biden this week is a critical moment to commit to clear and immediate action ahead of COP26 in Glasgow.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            However a recent UK net zero policy tracker update by thinktank Green Alliance confirms that the UK still needs to make major changes in the next few years to meet its carbon emissions reduction targets.On current trajectories, the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions will be nearly 40% higher in 2030 than they need to be to have a good chance of reducing them to net zero by 2050.The data shows that most UK emissions reductions have so far come from replacing coal with renewables for electricity generation, with other significant reductions in heavy industry and less biodegradable waste being sent to landfill.But the report confirms that emissions from transport, housing and agriculture have barely come down over the past decade, with transport emissions, the UK’s biggest source of greenhouse gases, at the same level as in 1990."

The council’s draft Parks and Green Spaces strategy mentions “sponsorship and commercial opportunities” as “alternatives to traditional revenue funding”. Have your say here.“EXETER STREETS” NEWTOWN CONSULTATION TO 30 APRILAfter Heavitree and Whipton it’s the turn of Newtown residents to tell Exeter City Council and Devon County Council how they would like to see their neighbourhood improved. The consultation emphasis is on increasing “active travel” although it offers scope to comment on a range of issues including public spaces, parking, play and recreation and the wider community.We’re not sure whether running this consultation during the pre-election period is strictly in line with the letter of the legislation that restricts local government communication activities, but that shouldn’t prevent Newtown residents having their say. The survey will inform proposals which will come forward during the summer.A NEW EXETER LOCAL PLAN IS ON ITS WAYExeter City Council’s Executive forward plan lists a Local Development Scheme report due on 1 June then a Local Plan initial consultation document for approval on 6 July.

"content" : "Exeter City Council has announced plans to produce a new musical theatre extravaganza to celebrate the city’s UNESCO City of Literature status.Exeter the Musical, billed as “an ambitious celebration of a better life in the world’s most world-class city”, will also form the principal plank of the city council’s post-pandemic economic recovery package.The musical’s narrative will take its inspiration from The Nun’s Priest’s Tale, one of The Canterbury Tales by the fourteenth century poet Geoffrey Chaucer.The tale, whose full title in Middle English is The Nonnes Preestes Tale of the Cok and Hen, Chauntecleer and Pertelote, is a satirical mock-heroic fable set in a world of talking animals who reflect both human perception and fallacy. It explores the surprising claim that a cockerel can possess the wisdom and book-learning of a scholar.Its protagonist is Chauntecleer, a proud and boastful rooster who loves to strut and crow in his domain, the yard of a poor country cottage. Chaucer describes him as the “regal cock Chauntecleer in his pasture, like a prince in his hall”, with a comb “redder than a perfect coral” and says “in all the land of crowing there was none his equal”.Exeter the Musical - “an ambitious celebration of a better life in the world’s most world-class city”The narrative begins with Chauntecleer waking from a dream in which he foresees his approaching doom in the form of a fox. Pertelote, the favourite among his seven hens said to be “very similar to him in colour”, warns him of the folly of human hubris in the ribald, comedic language typical of the tale:“A dream is nothing but a conceit. Dreams are caused by overeating, by flatulence or by one of the four humours in a person’s body being out of balance.“Without doubt, this dream which you have just had is because of an excess of your red bile, which causes folk to have nightmares.”Unfortunately for Chauntecleer, his premonition turns out to be true. A fox “full of sly iniquity” who previously tricked Chauntecleer’s father and mother to their downfall lies in wait for him.Despite the warning in his dream, the fox succeeds in preying on Chauntecleer’s inflated ego by insisting he would love to hear Chauntecleer crow:“Chauntecleer began to beat his wings; he was completely taken in by all the flattery and failed to see the treachery that was taking place.”The fox snatches Chauntecleer in his jaws and flees through the forest with all the animals in the yard giving chase.Rosa Medicinae (Rose of Medicine) of 1313 by John of Gaddesden. Image: Exeter Cathedral.The choice of source material for Exeter City Council’s new venture in musical theatre production was inspired by a fourteenth century book of diseases and medicine which has its home in Exeter Cathedral’s library archive.Rosa Medicinae (Rose of Medicine) was written by John of Gaddesden, a medieval English physician who Chaucer may have had in mind when dreaming up the “Doctour of Phisik” mentioned in the prologue to The Canterbury Tales.A spokesperson for Exeter Culture said: “Like so many other ways in which Exeter claimed UNESCO City of Literature status, Chaucer’s passing mention of a character who may have been based on the author of a book, a copy of which is kept in Exeter, places the city at the centre of a rich web of literary connections.“It doesn’t matter that Gaddesden never lived in or anywhere near Exeter. Or Chaucer.”A spokesperson for Exeter City Council said: “Exeter is a truly world-class city in every way. We’re sure that, had Chaucer ever heard of us, he would have sent his pilgrims to Paris Street instead of Kent.”“Every mention of Exeter in the media, never mind the veracity of the story, is more proof of the city’s status as a global leader.”A spokesperson for Visit Exeter said: “After enjoying all that Canterbury had to offer, we’re sure Chaucer’s pilgrims would have made Exeter their next must-see destination.”    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.    Subscribe freeThe Nun’s Priest’s Tale is also notable for containing the first reference in English literature to an association between practical jokes, hoaxes and 1 April. In the story Chauntecleer is tricked by the fox on “Syn March bigan thritty dayes and two”, the 32nd day of March.Several well-known figures are in line to star in Exeter the Musical, with 1980’s pop legend Rick Astley hotly-tipped to take the role of Chauntecleer. Overlooked local talent Jean Rhys is also rumoured to be considering playing a part.Those who would like to know how Chauntecleer fares following the chase through the forest will have to wait to see the show when it is staged later this year at Exeter’s Corn Exchange. Tickets go on sale on 6 May."

"content" : "Twitter followers of Karime Hassan, Exeter City Council’s Chief Executive and Growth Director, may have noticed his frequent recourse to statistics which paint the city in a favourable light. The most recent such tweet, posted on 17 March, read:“According to @CentreforCities Exeter is among the top 10 cities in the UK for: population growth (2nd), housing stock growth (6th), air quality (5th), low CO2 emissions (7th), low claimant count (2nd) &amp;amp; low proportion of working age pop’n with no formal qualifications (2nd).”Centre for Cities (CfC) describes itself as follows:“Our mission is to help the UK’s largest cities and towns realise their economic potential. We produce rigorous, data-driven research and policy ideas to help cities, large towns and Government address the challenges and opportunities they face – from boosting productivity and wages to preparing for the changing world of work.”The CfC website provides a data tool which enables comparisons to be made between up to 63 cities and large towns across a range of indicators. The data is extracted from publicly available statistics, mostly from central government or other national agencies.The statistics quoted in Mr Hassan’s tweets appear designed to reinforce the council’s marketing of the city as a success story. The city’s syntactically ambiguous strap line Exeter Live Better fights for space alongside other council-inspired snippets such as Liveable Exeter, Live &amp;amp; Move and Building Exeter Back Better. But without substantiating evidence, this is all public relations puff.Centre for Cities City Monitor Exeter profile. Image: Centre for CitiesIt is important to note that the CfC only presents figures for 63 cities and towns. Rural districts, for example, are excluded so comparative rankings are limited to urban areas and do not capture the complex impact of a city’s travel to work area.In fact Exeter was only included in the CfC’s figures when its methodology was changed in December 2015 to reduce its previous emphasis on travel to work areas.Exeter’s is very large: the city’s population is currently estimated to be 129,000 while its travel to work area includes 470,000 residents.Of the indicators Mr Hassan selected in his recent tweet, it is fair to make the following points (figures quoted are almost all from 2019 and so unaffected by the pandemic).PopulationWe were unable to find data which supported the claim that Exeter has the second highest growth rate in the UK, although it has figured in the top ten for several years now.Its small population compared to the other CfC cities, fifth from bottom of the list, means relatively few additional residents translate to relatively large percentage changes.Population growth is both a positive – if you are selling goods and services to people – and a negative – if you prefer Exeter as a quiet county town with less demand for housing.HousingThe city having the sixth highest housing stock growth (1.46%) in 2018-19 highlights a positive story. The need for more housing is well-documented, and the Liveable Exeter programme aims to build 12,000 new homes in the city by 2040 by applying some innovative thinking to their location and planning.Yet the CfC figures also measure the housing affordability ratio, which is the average house price in an area divided by gross average annual earnings in the same area.CfC gives Exeter as the sixth least affordable city beaten only in the unaffordability stakes by Oxford, London, Cambridge, Brighton and Bournemouth. August company these cities may be, but that offers small consolation for many people trying to buy a house here.It is worth noting that compared with all local authority districts and boroughs in England and Wales, Exeter is relatively more affordable. With the exception of Torbay and Plymouth, all Devon’s other districts are less affordable than Exeter.On a national scale, which shows each London and metropolitan borough separately, Exeter ranks 182nd out of 339 local authority areas in England and Wales for affordability.Air qualityAlthough ranked fifth in the UK by the CfC for the lowest number of days of poor air quality each year, Exeter is in the number one position for England.Residents may be surprised at this, but the data covers the whole city and makes little allowance for the known pollution hotspots where levels of nitrogen dioxide exceed or are close to the legal limit.Carbon emissionsAt seventh from the top, and on equal ranking with Plymouth and just below London, this looks like another positive. There is much more to do, particularly in reducing private car use, but the city does have a plan, albeit flawed, aimed at reaching net zero carbon by 2030.However the Department for Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy figures used by the CfC exclude emissions from international air travel, shipping and the production of imported goods and services. So the varying extent to which places export their emissions elsewhere in the UK and abroad distorts these figures.The majority of the UK’s carbon-intensive industries are concentrated in the Midlands, North of England and Scotland, with very little such activity taking place in Exeter.And Exeter’s performance over time is much more middling: in the ten years to 2018 the city’s emissions reductions per capita were only two thirds of the national average.Claimant countAlthough recorded in the number two spot, behind York and just above Oxford and Cambridge, this is not a particularly helpful indicator. The government explains that the claimant count is a measure of the number of people claiming unemployment related benefits. Before 2013 this was simply the number of people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance.From April 2013 Universal Credit claimants searching for work were added to the claimant count, meaning that more people are brought within the coverage of the count, so it is set to rise noticeably over time and will happen irrespective of how the economy performs.As a result, the Office for National Statistics withdrew the claimant count from its national Labour Market Statistics Bulletin in March 2017, stating that the it was no longer a reliable economic indicator.

Subscribe freeQualificationsMr Hassan’s selection of the proportion of working age population with no formal qualifications as an indicator again shows Exeter in a good light. Behind only Crawley (aka Gatwick Airport), Exeter has the lowest proportion of the 63 CfC cities at 3%.Less impressive is the other end of the qualifications scale, where the CfC indicator is the proportion of the working age population with a qualification at NVQ4 (Higher National Diploma level) or above.Exeter ranks 22nd out of 63 with a score of 38.9%. Reducing the CfC comparators to cities with one of the high-performing Russell Group universities (which includes the University of Exeter) places Exeter at 13th out of 18.Perhaps worryingly, the CfC figures show that over the period 2015-19 the proportion of the working age population with such qualifications in Exeter fell by 2.9%, whereas the national average increased by 3.3%.Like most statistics, this figure is open to interpretation. For example, is Exeter’s proportion so low because many of the university’s academics prefer to live outside the city’s boundaries?EarningsMr Hassan does not select any figures relating to earnings in Exeter. It is easy to see why.In 2020 the CfC gave average weekly workplace earnings for Exeter as £456.73 and ranked the city in 49th place out of 63. Between 2016 and 2020 these average earnings fell by 11.8% in the city, a decline only exceeded by Blackburn and Burnley, both in Lancashire.Exeter also has one of the lowest levels of private sector jobs and one of the lowest ratios of private to public sector employment in the CfC index. It is seventh from bottom on both metrics.Code of practiceThere is also a propriety issue here. Local authorities are required by legislation to consider the Government Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity (issued under section 4 of the Local Government Act 1986) when communications, in whatever form, are addressed to the public or a section of the public.The code’s principles include the requirement that such communications should be both objective and even-handed, and specific clauses that bar local authorities from using their resources to persuade the public to hold particular views on questions of policy and require that they address controversial matters fairly.In addition, Local Government Association guidance based on this legislation makes it clear that “councils should not publish any material which, in whole or in part, appears to be designed to affect public support for a political party”.This may not have been Mr Hassan’s intention, but Exeter’s Labour Party and a Labour candidate in the forthcoming city council elections both retweeted his tweet and claimed the success story it seemed to tell to be the result of having a Labour-led council.We believe Exeter’s voters should be sufficiently well-informed about what is taking place to participate effectively in local democracy and make choices in the interests of their family, friends and communities.To this end we consider it our duty to redress the balance by providing a more complete account of Exeter’s economic and environmental position."

"content" : "The developers of a purpose built student block in Exeter city centre have applied for planning permission to convert several of its street-level retail units to student accommodation.The Depot currently includes eleven ground floor retail and leisure units in addition to 715 student bedrooms. But the developer has so far failed to secure commercial tenants for eight of the units.The proposals are to create nineteen student bedrooms by reconfiguring five of these units, which would increase the total number of student bedrooms in the block to 734.The changes would mean approximately 25% of the designated retail and leisure space would be converted.Empty retail units at The Depot on Cheeke StreetThe Depot was built in two phases by Mace Developments Limited on the site of the former Stagecoach depot between Bampfylde Street, Summerland Street, Cheeke Street and Belgrave Road in Exeter city centre.Construction of the six to eight storey block was due for completion by the beginning of the 2019-20 academic year but was delayed and alternative accommodation had to be found for hundreds of student tenants.Marketing and promotion of the retail units began in late 2018. In September 2020 a Co-op store opened at the Cheeke Street/Belgrave Road corner of the building, opposite the Vue cinema, and the Department of Work and Pensions are intending to relocate the Job Centre from its current position on Western Way to two of the units on Belgrave Road.However the developer says that there has otherwise been “no confirmed interest from high street names or nationally recognised chains”. Informal offers from other businesses such as start-ups have been rejected on the basis they were “not commercially viable”.Attempts to find “meanwhile” or “pop-up uses” for the spaces have so far also been unsuccessful.

Subscribe freePlanning permission for the development was originally granted for the first phase in January 2017 and the second in June 2019.The applications were considered in the context of Exeter’s Local Plan Core Strategy, which sets out the strategic vision for development in the city. This includes “maintaining a vital and viable mix of uses in the city centre and delivering development to enhance Exeter’s position as a premier retail and cultural destination.”The site also falls within the Grecian regeneration area defined in the strategy. It says that developments in this area will “enhance the city’s unique historic townscape quality”, “create places that encourage social interaction” and “enhance and expand the city’s retail function to improve Exeter’s draw as a regional shopping centre”.A planning officer’s report accompanying the application also said the buildings were “designed to have active and transparent frontages” with the positioning of the retail units allowing forecourt areas “which could be used for seating in association with cafes etc”.The recent application to renew previously-granted planning permission for an eight storey 108-bed student accommodation block on the site of the King Billy public house includes similar plans for a retail unit and a pub or restaurant space on Longbrook Street.Exeter City Council will consider the applications at a later date. More details are available on the city planning portal."

"content" : "The Department for Transport has confirmed that regular passenger rail services will be reinstated on the Okehampton to Exeter line at the end of this year.The new service will initially run every two hours, and is expected to increase to hourly towards the end of 2022, subject to further upgrades. Eight 130-seat trains will run each day in either direction between 7am and 10pm. Journey time from Okehampton to Exeter will be 40 minutes.Regular passenger services on the newly-branded Dartmoor Line were withdrawn in June 1972. From 1972 the line was used to transport railway ballast from Meldon Quarry and for occasional freight traffic and charter trains. There has been a Sunday service on the line during the summer since 1997.Funding for the £40 million reinstatement was announced in the budget on 3 March. The money will be used to purchase the line from its current owner and for upgrade and maintenance works.Train at Okehampton Station in 2015. Photo: Richard Curnow under Creative Commons license.It will be the first project delivered under the Department for Transport Restoring Your Railway scheme which aims to reinstate some of the services and stations that were axed following the 1963 Reshaping of British Railways report. Its author, British Railways chairman Richard Beeching, called for the closure of most of the network in Devon and north east Cornwall.Reinstatement works will involve drainage, fencing and bridge repairs, the replacement of 24,000 concrete sleepers and the installation of 29,000 tonnes of ballast. A total of eleven miles of track will be replaced.Improvements will also be made to Okehampton station, which will not be staffed. These include the installation of a ticket vending machine, help point, public address system, information screens and CCTV. The station car park will have dedicated disabled bays and the station building and platform will be fully accessible.All services will run to Exeter St David’s with around half the weekday services extending to Exeter Central. Weekend services will be extended to Exeter Central where possible at a later date. All trains will also stop at Crediton and some services will stop at Newton St Cyres.The new service will mark the 150th anniversary of the railway arriving in Okehampton in 1871. Trains will not run on the Dartmoor Line during reinstatement works.Southern Region timetable map 1962.

However services on the line were withdrawn in December 2019 and Dartmoor Railway CIC entered administration in February last year.Okehampton station in 1997. Photo © Devon County Council.Meanwhile the OkeRail Forum and Community Interest Company was formed in 2014 to campaign for the restoration of passenger services on the line, and Central Devon MP Mel Stride facilitated numerous meetings with government ministers, local councillors, campaigners and representatives from Great Western Railways and Network Rail.The combined efforts of stakeholders led to Chris Grayling, then Secretary of State for Transport, asking Great Western Railways to draw up a reopening plan in January 2018.Preliminary work started on the ground in 2020, when Network Rail and Great Western Railway began assessing the infrastructure and control system improvements necessary to bring the line up to the required safety standards.The plan to reopen the line finally appeared in the National Infrastructure Strategy alongside the Chancellor’s Autumn Spending Review in November last year.Okehamption station platform in 2006. Photo: Graham Tait under Creative Commons license.The aspiration to reopen the line further westwards remains. The vision is to connect Exeter to Plymouth by rail without travelling via Dawlish, where parts of the sea wall were breached in 2014 during a storm, undermining the track and forcing its closure for two months.Peninsula Rail Task Force, which was formed in 2013 following a series of severe weather events, published a South West Peninsula strategic rail blueprint to address this and other regional rail infrastructure issues in 2016.It proposed long term investment in south west transport resilience to address the region’s vulnerability to increasing numbers of climate change-related severe weather incidents."

"content" : "In 1981 Exeter City Council was faced with several decaying and under-used assets around its historic quay and canal basin which required capital investment to create a viable future. Severe central government controls on council spending made it impracticable to fund the work from the council’s own capital programme, so it set up the Exeter Canal and Quay Trust as a development and regeneration vehicle.This approach allowed spending through the trust to remain off the council’s books. The challenge was that the trust had to generate funds before it could spend any.40 years later, the trust can now point to a successful financial record. By 1995 it was making a surplus of £41,900 on a turnover of £84,900. By 2020 it was generating £328,200 as investment income, mostly from rents, while making a net loss on investments of £90,800. Its total funds that year amounted to £4.2 million.The trust reached this position by focussing in the early years on extracting value from its property portfolio, including selling long leases or freeholds for some of its properties to build up capital. It sought investments with a good prospect of a return and avoided long-term commitments to financially unrealistic projects.In turn it has been able to fund several improvement projects such as the Fish Quay and Antiques Centre and the suspension bridge over the river. From the 2000s it began to offer grants for relevant local projects, including to Devon Wildlife Trust for works at Cricklepit Mill. A current project is the development of a literature hub in Exeter Custom House.The trust is a business, both a registered charity and a limited company, although eight of its twelve trustees are city councillors who change with considerable frequency. The chair, Alan Williamson, has been in post since the early 1990s.To provide a framework for acceptable uses and development of the quay area, Exeter City Council produced a Canal Basin Masterplan which was adopted as a supplementary planning document in July 2004. This focussed on retaining the character of the area and important buildings. Crucially, it did not specify that future uses of buildings had to be waterway-related.])Maclaines Warehouses beside Exeter ship canalMaclaines Warehouses are a group of prominent Grade II-listed buildings which stand at the heart of the canal basin between Exeter ship canal and the River Exe beside Piazza Terracina. Described by Historic England as a “typical mid-nineteenth century warehouse”, they are an important reminder of the role of the quay, canal and canal basin in Exeter’s historic past as a commercial maritime port.The Canal Basin Masterplan stated that future uses of Maclaines Warehouses had to be compatible with “minimal intervention to the fabric of the building”. Ground floor uses “could include specialist retail, leisure or craft workshops. Upper floors included leisure, exhibition, office or craft workshop space.”The masterplan has not been replaced and remains in force as a document to be taken into consideration when determining planning applications. There have been calls by waterways interests for it to be updated.The city council’s current local plan core strategy also sets out development principles for the quay and canal basin. One is that development must “respect the historic character of the area and incorporate uses that realise the potential of existing high quality historic buildings”.Exeter Civic Society (a charity of which the author is a member) had been monitoring developments on the quayside and canal for many years when, in January 2014, it stepped up its interest by establishing a River, Canal and Quayside sub-committee. The committee’s remit is “to preserve and enhance the character of the river, canal and quayside and examine and comment on matters affecting them”.Led by Peter Nickol, the committee published its own prospectus A Future for Exeter’s River, Canal and Quayside in August 2015. Intended to influence Exeter City Council’s own review of the waterways, it said: “At the core of the civic society’s thinking is the recognition that decisions affecting the waterways and their environs, whether or not based on current interests and activities, will endanger the distinctive qualities of the area unless there is a considered set of strategic goals.”In relation to the quay and the canal basin area, the report said: “One of its qualities is that it is relaxed and not crassly and commercially over-exploited. We want to see this quality preserved while its distinctive heritage, tourist, arts and educational potential is sensitively developed.”In 2016 a small group of people, with support from the civic society, established the Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal (an unincorporated association of which the author is also a member). As a free-standing body, with aims relating solely to the canal, it has been able to develop a close relationship with the Inland Waterways Association and organise practical maintenance work on the canal.Although the Friends’ remit extends to the whole length of the canal, it pays special attention to developments in the canal basin. Helmed by its chair John Monks since inception, the organisation produced a prospectus of improvements in April 2018, Exeter Ship Canal - Issues and Opportunities, which it believed were necessary if the canal – and particularly the canal basin – was to become more than an environment shaped by the demands of investment finance.The prospectus calls for better promotion of the canal, new slipways, residential moorings, canal holidays and development of heritage and maritime activities in the canal basin.The Friends’ overall position is set out in the second paragraph of the prospectus: “Income generation and improvements go hand in hand; but we feel their value will be limited unless policies are simultaneously developed to address the constraints that affect the canal’s use and therefore its income potential in the future.”The Boat Shed pop-up paperMaclaines Warehouses also stand at the heart of differences over the role of the quay, canal and canal basin in Exeter’s future, between the Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal and their supporters on the one hand and Exeter City Council and Exeter Canal and Quay Trust on the other .The buildings have not had long-term tenants since Exeter’s Maritime Museum closed in 1997 after nearly thirty years occupancy. In 2013 the owner of the Bike Shed Theatre and bar in Fore Street, David Lockwood, identified Maclaines Warehouses as a potential new theatre, arts and crafts venue and maritime heritage centre complex.He ran a “pop-up” trial between May and September 2017 to test the water which included music and theatre, art and crafts, an ice cream parlour and cocktail bar, al fresco dining and even indoor mini-golf. There was considerable enthusiasm for the project’s vision of an Exeter waterway agora: the pop-up was funded by donations from 500 local people. This author remembers the place hosting a particularly enjoyable hustings during the June 2017 general election campaign.Exeter Canal and Quay Trust was more sceptical. David Lockwood’s business plan was, in its view, too reliant on funding from grants to become a going concern. The Bike Shed Theatre subsequently closed, David Lockwood moved away and no more was heard of the Boat Shed plan.Since late 2018 two of the building’s four units, each of which have ground and upper floors, have been occupied by Topsham Brewery. It provides a bar on the ground floor of unit 1 and uses the ground floor of unit 2 as a brewery. The company obtained planning permission from the city council in August 2020 to use the first floor for another bar and events area and the second floor as a brewery office.The trust appeared keen on Topsham Brewery. Yet it also needed a stable occupant for units 3 and 4. The lease was advertised and the preferred applicant was Forward Space, the brainchild of Gavin Eddy, a former investment banker. Forward Space specialises in creating co-working and shared workspace in regional towns and cities by re-developing historic and other buildings.Forward Space applied for planning permission to convert units 3 and 4 in December 2019. Central to the company’s proposals is the creation of an open plan co-working space and a combined cafe/event space at ground floor with two floors of dedicated office spaces for local small businesses above.The Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal and Exeter Civic Society formally objected to both planning applications, stressing the importance of using the buildings for maritime-related activity as part of an overall plan for the quay, canal and canal basin. While neither organisation appears to recognise the long-standing links between boat crews and canal-side taverns, it is beyond argument that the Forward Space proposal is not a maritime-related use.

Subscribe freeThe Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal were particularly active in setting out the case against the Forward Space proposals. In a statement entitled Maclaines Warehouses – The Future sent to Exeter Canal and Quay Trust in June last year, John Monks asked the trust to pause the process of agreeing to lease units 3 and 4 to Forward Space so that interested parties could collaborate in developing a road map based on identified waterway-related uses. The statement drew particular attention to a likely post-pandemic fall in demand for office space.The trust responded by stating, in effect, that it was too late to change course now. It said it had been very difficult to find anyone interested in taking on the building who had a viable business plan and said it would be “highly inappropriate to renege on its original commitment” given to Forward Space.In July last year John Monks wrote on behalf of the Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal to the chair of Exeter Canal and Quay Trust, the leader of the city council and the city council’s chief executive. The letter restated the importance of securing a maritime-related use for units 3 and 4, argued that post-pandemic uncertainties about the need for office space made the Forward Space proposal financially risky, observed that Gavin Eddy had made very slow progress with a similar project in Taunton and noted that all relevant decisions by the council and trust had been taken behind closed doors.The city surveyor replied, reiterating the trust/council position. Meanwhile Gavin Eddy told us he sees the changes in working practices caused by the pandemic as strengthening his business model, not the reverse, because he is not offering conventional fixed offices but flexible working, a view which was supported in the city surveyor’s letter.Gavin Eddy also explained the reasons for the delay in the Taunton project, which he said stemmed largely from lack of promised funding from public authorities, and told us that the Taunton facility is on track to open in September. According to Mr Eddy, the Exeter facility will be complete by the end of 2021 with an official launch at the very beginning of 2022.In August last year Forward Space received planning permission to convert Maclaines Warehouses. The decision was delegated to city council planning officers, rather than being taken by elected councillors at the city’s planning committee, and dealt with alongside another decision concerning Topsham Brewery with the same agent acting for both.At the time of writing, the future of Maclaines Warehouses is not yet cast in stone. Alan Williamson of Exeter Canal and Quay Trust told us that settling the leases had been “legally complicated” though he was hopeful that matters would be completed within the next few weeks. Gavin Eddy said he hoped conversion work would start on site in July.Exeter Rowing Club and Exeter Canoe Club currently occupy the ground floor of units 3 and 4 under a lease which would require them to vacate at short notice. Alan Williamson confirmed both clubs were being kept informed of progress.Maclaines Warehouses beside Exeter ship canal viewed from Piazza TerracinaIn November 2020 the Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal, supported by the Inland Waterways Association, published a new vision and action plan for a reinvigorated canal, Making the Canal Matter Again to Exeter. It was issued in parallel with the award of Heritage Harbour status to the port of Exeter, the first such award in the south west.The award was warmly welcomed by Exeter City Council, which supported the Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal application for the designation. The Heritage Harbour status offers the potential for a reset in relationships between the various stakeholders. John Monks of Friends of the Exeter Ship Canal told us:“The city council and trust are both enthusiastic about the Heritage Harbour designation the Friends achieved for the canal and basin as integral parts of the Port of Exeter.“To get the most from it depends on their seeing it not so much as a flag of status but as a stimulus to work together on creating the maritime heritage revival that is at the heart of every heritage harbour.“We have proposed that there should be a road map drawn up independently to help align all the various aspirational aims and objectives that may now come along with common objectives for the waterways’ maritime future. We have asked the trust for £5,000 of funding to allow the Friends to commission it.“Without the shared sense of direction the road map will provide, and if there is no involvement of the wider waterways community that makes up the port, interest in the Heritage Harbour itself will soon dry up.”Meanwhile, the Exeter Canal and Quay Trust has been developing a new vision, which is to be issued next month. It has identified three draft priorities:      “In collaboration with partners, to promote the quay area and its businesses as a vibrant destination for residents and visitors.        “To develop the custom house as Exeter Canal and Quay Trust’s flagship public building for the benefit of people in Exeter, Devon and beyond.        “To ensure that Exeter Canal and Quay Trust’s property portfolio remains in beneficial and sustainable occupancy.”  However sensible these priorities may be, there is little in them to suggest active support for a vision which anchors Exeter’s quay, canal and canal basin in its historic maritime past."

"content" : "Maintenance – the property upkeep variety, not post-divorce payments – is seldom glamourous or even interesting. It is readily overlooked by politicians and bureaucrats whose careers are advanced by being seen to innovate. A brand new play facility and its attendant publicity gets more brownie points than the unnoticed activity of preventing an old one from falling apart.Every so often, however, the past hits the present with an unpleasant surprise, commonly in the form of a whopping bill.Past reality hit Exeter City Council’s senior politicians in just this way at an Executive meeting in October last year. A report on corporate asset maintenance presented lead councillors with a long list of council assets – mostly buildings – that had not been properly maintained over the previous ten years or more.The bottom line was a proposal to spend £37.5 million over the next four years to put things right. The alternative was to let the assets decay even further with loss of income, or closure, or even demolition as a response to the inevitable resulting health and safety issues.The neglected assets identified for priority action in the condition survey, with estimated repair costs, included Exeter Guildhall (£852,192), the Corn Exchange (£744,554) and the Matford Centre (£441,897). A total of just over £19 million for repairs to city council car parks was also included.Faced with this assessment, senior councillors had little choice but to agree to the spending, even though the finance director (who is also the Section 151 officer) said in the report that the sum would be unaffordable unless it was part-funded by the sale of assets. The council subsequently told us that a review of suitable saleable assets would be complete by summer 2021.Exeter Guildhall needs repairs costing £850,000It is worth reflecting on how matters reached this state.In the private session of an Executive meeting in July 2014 councillors heard proposals for a “more co-ordinated approach” to the newly-established council Corporate Property Unit which would “ensure the service was also fit for purpose with a focus on more efficiency and effective delivery of the maintenance spend”.Notwithstanding this decision, the city’s Corporate Asset Manager reported last October, just six years later, that the “condition of the council’s corporate property and engineering assets has been declining for many years due to a lack of investment to keep assets fit for purpose and protect income”.He said: “The legacy position of the council has been to repair property only when it fails. Responding only to failure causes unmanaged operational impact and presents risks to users of the building and the general public and gives rise to claims from leaseholders.”The £37.5 million package of measures intended to address the decline is made up of three elements:  A condition survey backlog, where maintenance needs to be carried out prior to degradation increasing in quantity and severity. Cost £4.94 million.  Current property maintenance requirements, to ensure assets remain safe, achieve improved performance or guard the council against excessive additional costs. Cost £21.85 million.  Engineering asset maintenance requirements, to ensure assets remain safe, achieve improved performance or guard the council against excessive additional costs. Cost £10.74 million.However the £37.5 million total is likely to rise because, as officers warned, these costs, which are estimates, may increase once the work is put out to tender, and because the council’s leisure facilities have not yet been surveyed following their return to council management from a private contractor.Last October’s report noted that there had been concern back in 2015 about a backlog in carrying out asset condition surveys, a problem presumably identified by the then-new Corporate Property Unit. Scrutiny of city council Executive meeting minutes gives no indication that this concern was flagged to councillors at the time.When we asked about the length of time before firm action was taken, the council said: “Critical maintenance was continued and any safety-related tasks, or tasks which if not carried out would have led to further deterioration, were completed during that time.“Assets continued to be condition surveyed to get the whole picture of asset condition and allow prioritisation of resources.”The £44 million St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre under constructionThe purest expression of a council’s intentions lies not in party election manifestos, nor in press releases, tweets and videos, nor in promises to constituents. It lies in the annual budget that it adopts as part of the process of setting council tax levels.The legal requirement on local authorities to set a balanced budget is intended to ensure that they do not live beyond their means. There is never enough money to do everything people want their councils to do. Consequently, councillors are forced to decide what is more important to them: the new play area or the five-yearly repainting schedule for the existing swings.Since October 2012, when Exeter City Council’s Executive green-lighted initial development work in private session, the council’s capital spending plans have been dominated by the need to pay for what we now know as St Sidwell’s Point, the new leisure centre on the bus station site.The leisure centre project was delayed against its initial programming, as is the case with many large capital schemes. It was not helped by councillors deciding in August 2015 to adopt an “enhanced” version of the original scheme, with attendant increased costs.In late 2018, when tenders to build the leisure centre had been received – thus exposing the planning cost assumptions to market realities – the budget for the project had risen to £43.8 million, more than double the initial £19.4 million cost agreed in December 2014.Payments to the newly-appointed contractor, Kier Construction, began in October 2018. Construction commenced in January 2019, with major payments to Kier starting from that date.    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.    Subscribe freeBecause of all the delays, capital budgets for the project which had been approved in previous annual budgets were not spent in full. Although in-year changes to capital programmes are a common feature of budgetary management, it appears that the slack arising from delays to the leisure centre was not applied, as it could have been, to the maintenance backlog.In that sense, the decline in the condition of the council’s assets is collateral damage caused by St Sidwell’s Point. The leader of the council, Phil Bialyk, stressed at last October’s meeting that he did not “want this to come across that somehow the authority has been negligent over a period of time”. Although that statement falls somewhat short of ruling out past negligence, it does not acknowledge that the council made choices in budget-setting which provided insufficient funds for the maintenance of its assets.The council denies that St Sidwell’s Point was a contributing factor to its maintenance problems. When we asked whether the absence of investment in maintenance had been caused, wholly or partially, by the decisions to spend capital funds on constructing St Sidwell’s Point, the council replied: “No, there is no link between the two – the two are decided entirely separately.”As there is only a single pot of capital funding which has to be divided between competing projects, we leave the reader to make up their own mind. Has the council chosen a glamourous new leisure facility over the less newsworthy responsibility of preventing its existing asset portfolio from falling apart? Perhaps its starring role in no fewer than four city council press releases in the past three weeks provides a clue."

"content" : "Princesshay’s owners have applied for planning permission to convert the top floor of the former Debenhams store into a cinema and cafe/bar.The conversion would involve raising most of the roof line by between 2.5 and 3.5 metres to accommodate the height of four cinema screens, and the conversion of part of the ground floor to provide dedicated access to the complex, which would include a foyer and bar/restaurant.Tenants are being sought for the rest of the former Debenhams store. The ground, first and second floors will remain separately accessible.Exeter Princesshay Debenhams closing down saleThe proposals have been developed in consultation with Exeter City Council, Historic England and the Dean of Exeter Cathedral.Discussions began in November 2019 when Debenhams were seeking to downsize and planned to vacate the top floor and “consolidate its trading in floors ground to second”. Debenhams went into administration in April 2020.The application, which is for a change of use from retail to cinema with ancillary bar/restaurant facilities, states that the proposed cinema operator cannot be named at this stage because of “commercial confidentiality”.It says that views of the cathedral from the foyer were a key consideration for the cinema operator in choosing a site in the shopping centre.Five of six units facing the former Debenhams are currently empty, four were cafe/bar/restaurantsThere are fourteen screens at four cinemas in Exeter city centre, all of which are currently closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Vue has seven, the Odeon four, Exeter Picturehouse two and Studio 74 at Exeter Phoenix has one.Two of these cinemas also have ancillary cafe/bars: Exeter Picturehouse and Studio 74 at Exeter Phoenix.Exeter City Council will consider the application at a later date.

"content" : "The government has announced that restrictions on door to door campaigning in the run-up to the local elections on 6 May will be relaxed from next week, in step with its planned changes to lockdown rules. The new regulations only apply in England: the devolved administrations are setting out separate plans for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.From next Monday 8 March, the same day as schools and colleges reopen and outdoor recreation or exercise with one other person becomes allowed, outdoor election campaigning will also be permitted.Doorstep canvassing and leafleting must take place on a one-to-one basis and COVID-19 restrictions must be respected. These include maintaining a two metre social distance, wearing face coverings and sanitising hands between visits to different households. Campaigners must not enter people’s homes and should only access shared hallways in blocks of flats where “absolutely necessary”.Then from 29 March, the same day as the “rule of six” is expected to return, election canvassing will be permitted to follow the same pattern, so groups of up to six campaign activists from different households can work together outdoors.As there will be no change to the rules on meeting others indoors, doorstep campaigning activity must continue to take place on a one-to-one basis. The new guidance also stipulates that campaigners should not collect postal ballots from electors for submission and should not transport electors to or from polling stations in private vehicles.Independent councillor Jemima Moore campaigning in Newtown during the 2019 Exeter local electionsThe new rules will allow nearly two months of outdoor campaigning in the run up to the 6 May polls. They replace a ban on election leafleting and doorstep campaigning that was expected to favour the two major parties. Smaller parties and independent candidates often rely on hand-delivering leaflets and doorstep canvassing and cannot match the resources that are routinely spent by the major parties on posting leaflets or social media advertising.Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith said: “Democracy should not be cancelled because of COVID. Voters appreciate being well-informed and campaigning is an important part of effective elections. I urge political campaigners to continue to show social responsibility and for parties, agents and candidates to ensure that their campaigners understand the rules.”Tom Hewat, election agent for Exeter Green Party, said: “We welcome the fact that we will once again be able to engage in our most successful campaign methods: delivering leaflets and talking to people on the doorstep. The safety of residents and our volunteers has always been of the utmost priority and, as ever, we will carefully follow the guidelines.“As a grassroots political movement, reliant on dedicated volunteers and without the funds available to the two main parties to pay for postal deliveries, the green light for outdoor campaigning is particularly welcome.”Michael Mitchell, chair of Exeter Liberal Democrats and city councillor for Duryard &amp;amp; St James, said: “Whilst welcoming any relaxation in COVID-19 regulations that is driven by medical data we remain concerned about the extent to which party volunteers and the public will be willing to engage in campaigning during the next few weeks.“As a local party we believe that the May elections should have been delayed until September. In the autumn more people will have received either their first or second vaccination and hopefully the medical data would have allowed normal campaigning to take place.”Exeter electors will be voting for city and county councillors and the Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner on 6 May. As the city council and police and crime commissioner elections should have been held last year but were delayed due to the pandemic, they will now take place at the same time as the scheduled county council elections. There is also a by-election taking place in Mincinglake and Whipton.There will be attempts to make polling stations safe. People who wish to vote in person will be encouraged to bring their own pencils or pens to mark ballot papers, masks must be worn, hand sanitiser will be available and screens and distance markings will be used.A significant increase from the nearly one in five votes that are usually cast by post in local elections is expected. The deadline for postal voting applications is 5pm on Tuesday 20 April, although anyone who wants to vote by post is encouraged to apply as early as possible. There are also new proxy voting measures for people who need to self-isolate because of coronavirus which will allow access to an emergency proxy vote up to 5pm on election day.

"content" : "Exeter City Council established the Liveable Exeter Place Board in 2019 to support the delivery of its “ambitious and visionary” Liveable Exeter programme. At the core of this programme is the aspiration to build 12,000 new homes in such a way that a series of communities are created which include retail and employment options and so reduce the need to travel across the city. It is intended to support the council’s goal of reducing the city’s carbon footprint to net zero by 2030.Exeter Observer’s July 2020 report on the Place Board highlighted legitimate public interest concerns about its role, membership and lack of transparency. The board is unelected, meets in private, does not publish its discussions or decisions and is taking responsibility for major policies which will determine Exeter’s future. In addition, a significant number of place board members have known property and land interests.Following that report the council took action to increase the underrepresentation of women and of people of colour on the board, a move also urged by some members of the city council.

At the time we asked the council a series of questions intended to shed some light on how the Place Board functioned. It answered six of our eight questions by referring to material on a website that did not exist when they were asked and which was created following our enquiry. The website offers partial information about the programme and the board, somewhat increasing its accountability to the people it is supposed to serve, but does not include important information about the content of the board’s discussions.We did ask for this information: one of our questions was a request for a list of the items discussed at each board meeting as set out on the convening agenda. The council refused to supply this, citing a bizarrely irrelevant provision in the Freedom of Information Act. We challenged this refusal, which was subsequently overturned. The information we received is published below.Meanwhile, the board’s membership changed again. Apparently not content with having the Bishop of Exeter representing the Christian faith, the council subsequently added the Dean of Exeter Cathedral. The Dean is in effect the managing director of the cathedral, and may have been seen as a better fit with all the other property interests on the board. The Dean’s appointment gave the Church of England two seats on the board while other faiths and churches in the city remain unrepresented.We requested an explanation as follows: “Why does the Board contain two representatives of the Church of England (the Bishop of Exeter and the more recent addition of the Dean of Exeter Cathedral) and none representing any other faith organisation? Exeter’s population is diverse, so if faith is important to the Board, it seems odd to have the CofE [Church of England] so disproportionately represented?”The city council’s reply was unexpected: “The board brings together leadership from across the city, public and private sectors, politics, personal views and backgrounds. All however give their time and energy freely to try to make Exeter a better city. Suggesting otherwise via a partisan narrative bears no resemblance to fact.”Quite apart from the fact that we made no comment about the motives of board members, it is the suggestion that we have adopted a “partisan narrative” that bears no resemblance to fact.A core purpose of independent public interest journalism is to hold influence and power to account by gathering and reporting information that people in leadership roles and other powerful interests might rather remained hidden. The only perspective from which this purpose might be considered partisan is that of those in leadership roles who do not enjoy being subject to scrutiny.It is fair comment that Exeter Observer has been constructively critical of the lack of accountability and transparency surrounding the board, and that we have published material about it that it appears some people would prefer not to be in the public domain.We make no apology for serving the governed, not the governors. We seek to inform, educate and empower the former while holding the latter to account by challenging their decisions in the public sphere. We aim to keep people who live or work in Exeter informed of what’s being done in their name, by whom, with the community assets they own and the taxes they pay.Of course, the excuse offered by the city council may simply be a fig leaf intended to conceal its inability or unwillingness to provide a rationale for the Dean’s appointment. We do not know. Perhaps, as Exeter is among the country’s least affordable cities in which to live, the Dean will promote a recent commission set up by the Archibishop of Canterbury which said housing affordability must be linked to people’s incomes rather than discounting the market rate?And what the board actually does remains opaque. The agendas we obtained by challenging the council’s refusal to disclose do, however, give an idea of the scope and range of its discussions. The board additionally met on six occasions during the period from 26 March to 4 June 2020 “to discuss matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic”. No agenda information was supplied for these dates.

It suggests that the only substantive item of business was a presentation about the city’s cultural strategy. Apart from this implying a dramatic reduction in the board’s remit, this is hardly the stuff of “frank and candid confrontation of the issues”, which are the kind of discussions which the council claims make it necessary to keep the content of board meetings secret. Or perhaps the juicy stuff did not make it to the summary?Our previous report set out in some of the intended responsibilities of the board, which included (our italics):  Develop and set joint investment strategies for the city and sub-region  Develop an infrastructure plan in support of the Liveable Exeter Garden City and as and when required the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan and associated sub-regional transport strategy  Consider and prioritise bids for external funding, including leading on housing, industrial and other appropriate deals  Consider, approve and implement decisions relating to Exeter and as appropriate subregional investment, including expenditure of external funding within the sub-region.At the time of writing, we did not know whether these responsibilities had in fact been assigned to the board, but it is now clear from a list of nineteen roles since published that these functions, and many more, are indeed included in the board’s remit.These wide-ranging and critically important functions have been handed to a body that is unelected, to which appointments were made on the basis of unknown criteria, for which there was no public invitation to express interest in joining, and which makes no pretence of consulting others about its analysis, discussion or decisions.

Subscribe freeWhile Exeter City Council has repeatedly said that any decisions that need to be made by the council will be brought to its committee machinery, and will thus be open to public scrutiny, there are several ways in which the accountability and transparency that this appears to promise could remain undelivered.First, the council could choose to deal with such items in what is known as “Part 2” of committee meetings – that is, the part of the meeting from which press and public are excluded and for which supporting documents and reports are rarely supplied. The bar for doing so is not high, and the council frequently deals with issues it considers sensitive this way.Second, it is likely that few of the board’s private conclusions will require a corresponding public decision, and so will remain secret. What is to stop a decision being discussed and agreed between board members for later presentation as a fait accompli by the council? The city’s chief executive, Karime Hassan, said in September that the board had already “amended” and “approved” parts of the city council’s 2018-2021 Corporate Statement in a report in which he justified the secrecy surrounding it on the grounds its members would not want the public to know what they were talking about in private.Third, as the agendas above make clear, board members take actions resulting from discussions at meetings then report those actions back to the board. The city council last week described the Place Board as having “shaped Exeter’s recovery plan”, which it has repeatedly said is being “led” by the board. Which of the board’s actions that involve “shaping” the city’s future do not merit wider discussion or require more democratic involvement?Exeter Observer recognises that the city council cannot deliver the Liveable Exeter agenda, which has many positive elements, on its own. We nevertheless believe that it will be more successful in achieving its goals by securing wider support from the whole of the city through open deliberation and meaningful community engagement instead of resorting to relying on secretive boards.At the same time, we object to the city council mimicking Michael Gove’s Cabinet Office in refusing to disclose information on the grounds that it does not like the viewpoint of the person or organisation making the request.Exeter City Council’s access to information policy begins by saying it is “committed to being an open and transparent council”. The policy goes on to say its aims are to:  show transparency of decision making by the council  improve and enhance the democratic process  build public trust and confidence.Neither the Liveable Exeter Place Board nor the city council’s responses to questions about it meet these standards. In fact, the council’s approach to the Liveable Exeter Place Board bears no resemblance to these standards at all."

"content" : "The government has confirmed that local elections will go ahead as planned despite doubts over whether it would be possible to hold the ballots during the coronavirus pandemic. Exeter electors will be asked to vote for city and county councillors and the Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner on 6 May.Exeter usually elects three city councillors to serve four year terms in each of thirteen wards, a total of 39 councillors. A third of the seats, one in each ward, is normally contested in each of three years, with county council elections then held in the fourth year.As the city council and police and crime commissioner elections should have been held in May last year but were delayed due to the pandemic, they will now take place at the same time as the scheduled county council elections. The city councillors and the police and crime commissioner will be elected for shortened three year terms to allow a subsequent return to the usual electoral cycle.2016 Exeter City Council election results. Source Wikipedia under Creative Commons license.The thirteen Exeter City Council seats that are being contested are those which gained the most votes in the 2016 local elections, when the whole council was exceptionally elected at the same time following boundary changes. Labour are defending eleven seats and the Conservatives two.There is also a by-election taking place in Mincinglake and Whipton following the death of a councillor. Voters in the ward will elect two city councillors with the person receiving the most votes serving a four year term and the runner-up a one year term.Devon County Council elections for all 60 members will also take place on 6 May. 56 councillors represent single-member divisions and four represent Broadclyst and Exmouth, which have two councillors each.The county council’s current composition is 42 Conservatives, 7 Labour Party, 6 Liberal Democrats, 2 Independents, 1 Green Party, 1 East Devon Alliance and 1 North Devon Liberal, following the 2017 elections before which boundary changes also took place.Devon County Council does not administer Plymouth or Torbay, which are both unitary authorities and are holding elections on the same day.The regional police and crime commissioner will be elected by everyone in Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly at the same time.2017 Devon County Council election results. Source Wikipedia under Creative Commons license.Claire Wright, Independent county councillor for Otter Valley, said that independents and candidates from smaller parties are being disadvantaged by a ban on election leafleting and door to door campaigning.She said: “Smaller parties and independent candidates rely on hand-delivering leaflets with a few of their helpers and spend weeks knocking doors and picking up and resolving issues. We do not have the resources to post leaflets or flood social media with advertising. Even if Independents did have this resource we’re not permitted to spend it.“Each election candidate is held to strict spending limits by the Electoral Commission. The difference is that in addition to individual spending limits, the two main parties have vast central budgets that they’re also permitted to use.”“This means they are likely to simply run their campaigns from central office online and by post. It would not be possible to post a leaflet to the six thousand or so properties in my county council division without breaching Electoral Commission rules.”Kevin Mitchell, Liberal Democrat city councillor for St James and Duryard and leader of the progressive group on Exeter City Council, said: “The very least the government should do is allow all candidates a free post delivery as in general elections.“Smaller parties and independent candidates have difficulty enough during normal elections raising funds. These new regulations will severely impede the ability of voters to know what is going on and who to vote for.”Tom Hewat, Exeter Green Party election agent, said: “We sought advice from organisations such as Public Health England on delivering literature. The advice was clear: the risk of spreading or picking up COVID-19 while distributing literature is so small as to be of no concern.“We accept that canvassing is not possible during lockdown. However, the ban on distributing literature door to door and allowing it only to be delivered by commercial companies has a strong whiff of a stitch up by the two largest parties.“The government claims it wants to ensure a level playing field for those standing in this year’s local elections. But the game is currently rigged against smaller parties who don’t have large funds to draw on.”The Government has defined new rules and is attempting to make polling stations safer so the elections can go ahead. On the current trajectory, all adults over 50 years of age will have been offered their first coronavirus vaccine jab by 15 April, three weeks before polling day.The choice between voting in person and voting by postal or proxy vote will remain, and anyone who is self-isolating can request a proxy vote up to 5pm on polling day itself.People who wish to vote in person will be encouraged to bring their own pencils or pens to mark ballot papers. Masks must be worn on the same basis as in any indoor public place. Hand sanitiser will be available and, where appropriate, screens and distance markings will be used inside polling stations, which will be cleaned regularly and ventilated as much as possible.Cabinet Office Minister Chloe Smith said: “Everyone who feels comfortable going to a supermarket or a post office should also feel confident attending a polling station in May. We encourage anybody who is shielding, or who would prefer not to attend a polling station, to apply for a postal or proxy vote ahead of the polls.”However Rob Hannaford, Exeter city councillor for Exwick and St Thomas and the Labour group leader at County Hall called the government’s approach “risky” and expressed concern about possible impact on turnout. He urged people to register for a postal vote: “The more people that vote early, safely from their homes, the more it will help ensure that polling day is more COVID-proofed and less busy, to help with waiting and queuing.”Staff shortages and a lack of available polling stations have caused problems for officials. Additional costs for personal protective equipment will also have to be met from the £31 million of extra government funding that has been allocated to the elections.Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said matters had been made more difficult by a government request that schools not be closed for use as polling stations and by the requisitioning of many other venues as testing or vaccination centres.Limits on the number of people allowed at counts, which are expected to take longer than usual, may also have to be imposed.

"content" : "Exeter City Council, Teignbridge District Council and Devon County Council have agreed to help fund a project to supply the new South West Exeter development with heat generated by the Marsh Barton waste incinerator.The scheme is not currently commercially viable because of the need for substantial upfront capital investment and uncertain rates of return, so the councils have agreed to support it with £7.3 million of funding in the form of grants and loans. The funding is expected to come from developer contributions, including the Community Infrastructure Levy. An advance payment of £50,000 will be made available for preliminary infrastructure works to take place.The incinerator is Exeter’s largest single source of carbon emissions, burning 60,000 tonnes of waste each year. The £45 million plant, which is run in partnership with Devon County Council, currently generates electricity to power the equivalent of more than 6,600 homes. It opened in 2014 and is expected to remain in use until 2050.The new district heating network will distribute heat generated by burning rubbish to nearby residential and commercial properties through a system of insulated pipes. The heat can be used for both space and water heating, although a dedicated gas boiler energy centre will be required to top it up. This will consume nearly 5000MWh of natural gas each year once the system is fully operational.

Subscribe freeViridor, the plant’s operator, says export of heat from the facility is around five times more energy efficient than its electricity generation. It will have the capacity to heat new homes and commercial buildings at Marsh Barton as well as those planned as part of the South West Exeter development.The councils say that the network would reduce carbon emissions from the proposed new homes by up to 2,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year, compared with every home instead using gas-fired domestic boilers. This figure does not, however, account for the carbon emissions generated by the waste incinerator, which were nearly 51,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year in 2018 according to the Department for Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy.No consideration appears to have been given to the possibility of other sources of heat being used to supply the network in future, apparently committing the city to high impact waste incineration for another thirty years. A wide range of heat sources are used to power the thousands of such heating networks in use around the world, many of which are truly low or zero carbon. These include geothermal and solar energy and heat pumps in a variety of configurations. Denmark is expected to use renewable sources for all its energy by 2050.South West Exeter development map. Source: Devon County Council.The South West Exeter development of 2500 new homes on the Teignbridge edge of Exeter will be larger than Exminster. It is presented as an extension of Exeter’s suburbs, although 80% of the new homes will come under the jurisdiction of Teignbridge District Council. It will include a school for 1400 pupils, shops and community facilities.The 90 hectare site, which stretches from Alphington to the M5 with the A379 dividing it in two, is expensive to develop because of its steep topography, existing road layout and proximity to the environmentally important Exe Estuary.  21.5 hectares are allocated as employment land at nearby Peamore.Devon County Council received £55.1 million from the national Housing Infrastructure Fund in February 2019 to pay for new roads and junctions, upgrades to roads, a pedestrian/cycle bridge to cross the A379, a public park and community building and a new electricity substation to help enable site development.The funding is provided as a grant to the county council, which is allowed to reclaim the cost of providing the infrastructure from developers as the housing is built. Once funding is recovered, the county council can use it to support further development sites."

"content" : "The University of Exeter has applied for planning permission to develop around 1,250 new student bedrooms on the north west corner of its Streatham campus between Cowley Bridge Road and Streatham Drive.The development plans would involve the demolition of twelve accommodation blocks, three other large buildings and a range of other structures such as bike and bin stores, 30 buildings in total. Eight new blocks would then be constructed on the fifteen acre development site.The development would provide  just under 50,000 square metres of internal floor space, around 90%  of which would be for student accommodation. A new shop and café would also be included, alongside study and social space and bike stores. Parking spaces would be provided for blue badge holders.The Birks Grange Village refectory, which was built in 1965, would be demolished and replaced with a six storey student accommodation block.The university Estate Services Centre would also be demolished and replaced with a three and four storey student accommodation block. The facility would be relocated to a new 3.5 acre site on the north side of the campus near the Belvidere Meadows nature reserve. Vehicle access would be via Rennes Drive.The Clydesdale and Nash Grove accommodation buildings, which were built between 1989 and 1992, would all be demolished and replaced with six new student accommodation blocks between three and eight storeys tall. Several of these buildings will be much taller than the existing blocks.In addition, five of the fifteen Birks Grange Village accommodation blocks, which were built between 2005 and 2011, would be renovated to improve their energy efficiency.Clydesdale and Birks development demolition plan. Image: Willmore Iles.Planning firm WYG (which has since adopted the name of its parent company Tetra Tech) was appointed by the university in September 2019 to prepare the application. It performed a two day consultation exercise at the university Innovation Centre in February 2020, which the university then followed with a web-based consultation in late February to mid-March.Issues raised included high levels of visual impact, student bedrooms overlooking nearby residential properties, loss of light in those properties and the impact of lighting and noise. Two of the twelve planned blocks were subsequently reduced in height.37 of 38 comments subsequently submitted by members of the public were objections to the development. Noise and light impact were cited repeatedly. One resident said: “The noise levels currently are extremely bad … the noise and light generation is going to be horrendous”.Another said: “The increase in student numbers, density and activity in recent years has already had a noticeable and detrimental effect” citing “numerous” instances of drug use, sexual activity and anti-social behaviour in Grafton Road at night. Another resident mentioned: “a lot of partying and noise (loud music) which goes on well into the night which will only increase with this massive increase in number of residents on the site”.Several people identified inadequate drainage in the area as a risk, saying existing sewers were unable to cope with heavy rainfall last year, and others raised concerns about environmental impact, saying owls, deer, badgers, bats and foxes all live in affected areas.Michael and Ann Head, both University of Exeter alumni, highlighted the failure of the planning statement and ecology report to mention Grassways Woods, a nature reserve owned by the university. They also said the planned single drop-off point for taxis and delivery vehicles in a complex of more than a thousand students looked “unworkable”.Clydesdale and Birks development illustrative view. Source: Design &amp;amp; Access Statement.Local residents Anne and Rod Barnes said: “This area of Duryard already has the highest ratio of students to residents in the city and the increasing dominance of the university has already had a massive impact on the local community”.They said five of seven houses in adjacent Glenthorne Road had recently been converted into student HMOs, adding that this process “obviously becomes self-perpetuating and will spread to other roads in the locality. A few years ago Glenthorne Road was a socially and demographically mixed and active community.”They also said: “When the university talks about the community consultation they’ve undertaken on the current proposals it would be more honest and accurate to say they are consulting the remnants of communities which have been depleted by their dominance in the area”, and expressed a “sense of depressed fatalism about the council’s history of viewing the university’s interests as always paramount”.One evidently elderly resident who has lived nearby for 48 years said: “This was such a wonderful area but now it will be torn apart.”    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.

"content" : "An application to renew planning permission for a eight storey 108-bed purpose built student accommodation block on Longbrook Street was submitted to Exeter City Council just before Christmas.Permission to develop the site, which includes the King Billy public house, was previously granted in April 2018. It included the condition that work was required to begin on site within three years.As the three-year window closes in April this year a “renewal of unimplemented planning permission” is necessary to prevent the permission lapsing. A letter accompanying the renewal application says “contractual reasons” are the cause of the delay.Longbrook Street student accommodation development site with the King Billy public houseThe construction of the block, which will be 26 metres tall at its highest point, will require demolition of the King Billy pub, which closed in July 2018. The King Billy was built in 1967 on the site of the Horse and Groom, which had occupied the site since 1740.The replacement building would span this site and the adjacent plot, which has been empty since 2007. It was previously occupied by Shepherd’s garage, the site of Exeter’s first petrol pump. Planning permission for a six storey student block was separately granted for the garage site in March 2016.The application to develop both sites, which was submitted in May 2017, was for 124 student beds across up to nine storeys. It claimed that the development would “relieve pressure on family housing” in the area.There were a number of objections. Robyn Connett of Exeter St James Forum said: “The evidence confirms increasing numbers of student HMOs in St James despite the Article 4 Direction aimed at preventing this. Many in the community feel a serious tipping point has already have been exceeded.”The plans were subsequently revised, resulting in a reduction in height and sixteen fewer bedrooms.

The site falls outside the Longbrook Conservation Area but within the scope of the St James Neighbourhood Plan, which was adopted as part of the Exeter Local Plan by Exeter City Council in March 2013.It includes a policy that large scale purpose built student accommodation should only be permitted where it’s possible to “integrate the design into the urban area”.The developer says the King Billy “appears at odds” with neighbouring buildings, and that the student block would “assimilate well within the street scene”. The new building would adjoin John Lewis, which the planning statement says is the tallest building in Exeter, and stand opposite Portland House, a seven storey student accommodation block.Longbrook Street student accommodation block elevation. Image: Grainge.The development plans include a retail unit and a pub or restaurant space on the ground floor and a roof terrace with communal lounge and “plant room”. An historic 15th century wall at the rear of the site would be partly altered to allow pedestrian access with the removed material used to “repair and improve the wall”. No car parking space is provided but storage for twenty bicycles is planned.The applicant is Bristol-based Rengen Developments Ltd. Its parent company Iesis Limited also owns a lettings company which manages student accommodation in Bath, Bristol and Worcester.Exeter City Council will consider the application at a later date. The plans are near-identical to those previously approved so it appears permission is likely to be granted. More details are available on the city council planning portal.There are currently 34 privately-owned off-campus student accommodation blocks in the city, according to the University of Exeter, of which twenty are within a ten minute walk of the Longbrook Street site."

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s “Liveable Exeter” vision identifies the redevelopment of the North Gate area of the city centre as one of eight strategic projects intended to “meet people’s needs for homes, jobs and services in the 21st century”. The “transformational housing delivery programme”, which is focused on “priority sites in public ownership”, aims to deliver 308 new homes on the sites of the Harlequins and Guildhall shopping centres.Curlew Alternatives, a developer which has previously specialised in purpose built student accommodation, said the redevelopment of the Harlequins site, which is owned by Exeter City Council, offers a “once in a generation opportunity to turn a failed shopping centre into a vibrant mixed-use development that brings inward investment into the city”.The redevelopment scheme presented to Exeter City Council in 2017 by the shopping centre’s former owners proposed student accommodation across the whole site, but pre-planning discussions and public consultation which began in June last year eventually produced revised proposals for a five storey 116-bed hotel and a seven storey block containing 251 “co-living” bedspaces, of which 99 are in studios and 152 in “cluster flats”.Co-living development is an emerging global real estate investment vehicle which is virtually indistinguishable from purpose built student accommodation. Building designs typically do not meet minimum space or amenity standards and tenancies are typically short-term and at rents double those charged in traditional private sector rented accommodation.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Opposition to the scheme has been widespread, with local and national conservation charities and hundreds of residents objecting on a wide range of grounds including harm to Exeter’s historic environment as well as the substandard design of the co-living block and the likelihood that, despite the developer’s claims, it will largely, if not entirely, be occupied by students. The redevelopment also poses significant risks to the section of Exeter city wall beside the site.More than 4000 people signed a petition opposing the development. One local resident called the design “a hideous, vile, ugly, totally monstrous, grossly oversized collection of blocks”, while another said the development was “an inappropriate hijack of a significant city centre location”. The Victorian Society said it would cause “significant harm” which had not been justified as required in the National Planning Policy Framework and could not be offset by the claimed public benefits of the proposal.According to the developer these include benefits to Exeter’s economy derived from the construction and subsequent operation of the hotel and co-living block, including spending associated with visitors and residents. However these were significantly overstated in the report to the planning committee which decided the application.The developer also claimed the co-living block would help the council meet its housing supply targets, but the government’s housing delivery test excludes such accommodation from its calculations.The council allowed the developer to fall short on its affordable housing provision requirements despite the city’s housing affordability crisis, and accepted the developer’s claims about minor public realm improvements at face value. Having said it would define its policy position on co-living before the redevelopment plans were submitted, as other cities have done, it instead decided to postpone the issue.Exeter City Council’s planning committee, which is dominated by ruling Labour group Executive members, subsequently approved the plans, subject to a legal agreement which has yet to be completed and other conditions being met. Exeter City Council leader Phil Bialyk said: “I really do think that this is a move in the right direction”.However it has since emerged that the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities &amp;amp; Local Government, who overturned approval for a similar co-living block in the centre of Norwich earlier this month, may intervene to call in and potentially overrule the city council’s decision.In this special report we examine the key issues involved in the decision and the basis on which it was made, and raise the prospect of more development decisions being taken this way by Exeter City Council under its “Liveable Exeter” banner.Harlequins co-living and hotel block elevations. Source: LHC Design.Overcrowding has been a feature of British urban life for centuries, often involving cramped conditions with few facilities for those who cannot afford better, from Edinburgh’s fifteen storey tenements to the rookeries of Dicken’s London. Many of the progressive social housing reforms of the interwar years were focussed on addressing the issue.A briefing note submitted as part of the Harlequins application by JLL, the developer’s agent, nevertheless described what it called “micro-living” as “a growing trend”. It also claimed that “micro-living” includes “the more traditional model of micro housing […] known generally as Houses of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs)” despite these being first defined in 2004 UK legislation which introduced licensing intended to tackle overcrowding, poor property management and impose minimum standards on a sector which often houses vulnerable tenants.There were an estimated 497,000 HMOs in England and Wales at the end of March 2018. Official estimates of the number of co-living units are not available, but only a few such developments have so far gained planning permission in the UK.JLL said the micro-living “trend” is the result of “growing affordability issues” and described co-living as an HMO “hybrid” in which units provide “all of a person’s basic housing needs” but which are “smaller in size”. Underlining the financial factors that drive the frequently tiny bedspaces provided in co-living developments, James Kingdom, an associate director at the firm, said: “Where land values are higher or pressures on land use are greatest, then there is an obvious need to increase the number of people that can live in these locations.”He also said that communal areas, such as dining or living rooms “provide the trade-off for a smaller living space” and, surprisingly, that these “are features that are unlikely to be present in a house share or self-contained flat.”Other differences with ordinary rented accommodation are that bedspaces are fully-furnished and optionally serviced at extra cost. Philip Hillman of JLL said: “The student accommodation sector has been transformed by a new generation of students who have grown accustomed to higher levels of serviced accommodation than has previously been available.“After graduation, they are pursuing similar high-quality accommodation that provides them with flexibility and consistency, regardless of location. Co-living seeks to fill a gap in the traditional residential market by providing a bespoke no strings attached purpose built managed offering.”Old Oak co-living development in London. Photo © David Hawgood under CC BY-SA 2.0.Proponents of co-living emphasise that it offers greater amenity than traditional rented accommodation, promoting it as “housing as a service” which offers all-inclusive perks to its occupants. JLL cites a 550-bed nine storey development near Willesden Junction in London as an example. Old Oak which, like the proposed Harlequins block, was also originally intended to be student accommodation, offers a gym, spa, restaurant and bar and includes twice-weekly room cleaning and bed linen changes in the rent.It was the UK’s first large scale co-living development, opening in 2016. Its marketing materials invite you to join a “thriving community” in which you can “find friendly faces, stimulating shared spaces and a boundary pushing events programme, all right inside your home”.It was developed by a company called The Collective which has since also opened a “haven of community and creativity” in a 21-storey 705-bed block at Canary Wharf and a 125-bed hotel in New York which is “packed with unique communal spaces designed to connect, learn and unwind”. The company has three developments in the pipeline, also in New York, which will add another 1215 units to its portfolio. It says its “mission is to build and activate spaces that foster human connection and enable people to lead more fulfilling lives”.However in a market forecast to be worth $550 billion over the next ten years in the US and Europe alone, co-living’s potential “to produce a greater return on investment” than standard private rented sector development may be what is really motivating massive investment in the sector.Older Women’s Cohousing development in London. Photo © Lucy Bridgers.Claiming to supply community as part of the package is a key pitch for most co-living companies. Matthew Stewart of the University of Westminster says that the most alarming feature of developments such as Old Oak “isn’t the banality of its architecture, the vague claims of solving a housing shortage or the pessimistic idea of a narcissistic youth driven through the next networking opportunity”, it’s that “this ‘new way of living’ is in fact a commodified old way of living, one that is steeped in the language of modernism yet robbed of its radical social intent”.Maria Brenton is a founder member of Older Women’s Co-Housing, a group of women over fifty who share an award-winning purpose-built development of 25 flats in London which the group created in partnership with a housing association. She says developer-led co-living projects that use the same language of community and inclusion as the co-housing movement are misleading because their residents don’t have any say in how the place is run.Other critics say co-living developments are symptomatic of cities failing young people, in which “the radical promise of co-housing has been co-opted” to promote “a private sector fix that merely scrapes the surface of a problem that the market first created”. Hannah Wheatley of the New Economics Foundation said, “co-housing in its purest form is about communities being in control of their housing” while “co-living is purely a new way for developers to squeeze profit from an already broken housing market”.Old Oak residents have first-hand experience that community isn’t a commodity that can be manufactured. They face fines of up to £250 for breaking house rules such a keeping communal spaces tidy and point to pervasive surveillance cameras as evidence that the claimed sense of community is missing.One said that the building is “not much more than a glorified student dorm”.Is co-living student accommodation by the back door?Like Old Oak, the scheme to redevelop the Harlequins shopping centre originally proposed the construction of purpose built student accommodation across the whole site. It then became a mixture of hotel and student accommodation in pre-planning discussions.Then, in the months leading up to the formal submission of plans, Exeter City Council leader Phil Bialyk began promoting the idea that the development could be used as student accommodation and co-living combined.In August 2019 he said he had discussed the city’s “policy on purpose built student accommodation” with councillors, officers and developers, and had received “commitments from some for co-living, which means that purpose built accommodation would be open to anybody and everybody”.In September 2019 he said: “We want new purpose-built student accommodation to have space for anyone to rent. This is the way we will achieve balanced and sustainable communities. Co-living will help future-proof expansion in this [higher education] sector, and I have been very encouraged with discussions I have had with developers and the university about our future planning policy in this area.”Then in October 2019 he said: “Co-living will allow key workers and anyone else to live alongside students” and “We’ve had some good discussions with developers about co-living. This will see new purpose–built student accommodation being made available to everyone”.Exeter City Council leader Phil Bialyk. Photo: Exeter City Council.However, by the time the developer submitted its plans in November 2019, the scheme had become a mixture of hotel and co-living, which it said had replaced the previously proposed student accommodation. The developer was keen to ensure that there was no misunderstanding: a Devon Live report about the plans was “amended after Curlew explained its co-living scheme does not refer to students and key workers and young professionals co-living side by side”.Students will nevertheless be free to live there, and are expected to live there: occupation is open to everyone over eighteen years of age. Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police expressed concern about safeguarding and “the potential for disruption” with student and non-students living alongside each other in its response to the planning application, and councillors repeatedly referred to students living in the block at the October planning committee meeting which approved the application.Diana Moore, Green Party councillor for St David’s ward, which includes the Harlequins site, described the co-living plans as “warehousing for people”, adding that they “appear to follow the same floor plans as the pre-application consultation showing student housing”. Keith Lewis of Exeter Civic Society also said: “The co-living accommodation appears to be exactly the same as that presented at consultation earlier in 2019 for student accommodation”.Liberal Democrat councillor Michael Mitchell, who is a member of the council’s planning committee, said that the proposed twelve week co-living leases “mirror university terms” and that the block “appears to be, in all but name, more student accommodation”.JLL director Chris Dadds nevertheless said: “the accommodation is for co-living, so it’s not a student scheme”. When pressed on how he would distinguish the plans for the Harlequins co-living block from those that would have been submitted had it instead been intended as student accommodation, he said it “wouldn’t have the same level of shared amenity on the lower floors or on each floor. The cluster flats would have looked similar but they wouldn’t then have shared wider accommodation within the building.”Comments made by another JLL director, Richard Lustigman, in a briefing note earlier this year may have been more revealing: “When it comes to defining coliving […] the term does surprisingly little to help us distinguish what it actually is. But could that ambiguity be its greatest strength? The sheer inability to be packaged and compartmentalised into an easily digestible definition is one of coliving’s greatest strengths.”  Community stakeholders?  The management plan for the proposed Harlequins co-living block says the “co-living product” delivers its claimed benefits through, among other things, “building managers and owners who have a stake in the local community”.    The scheme’s management company is part of Fresh Property Group, which is based in London and has more than 17,000 accommodation units under management on 66 sites across the UK &amp;amp; Ireland. It specialises in student accommodation provision.  Fresh Property Group is part of a larger group of companies controlled by Watkins Jones PLC, which is based in Bangor, and has been responsible for 123 student accommodation developments which contain a total of 41,000 bedspaces since 1999. Its most recent annual report and financial statement (to October 2019) shows annual revenue of £375 million and gross profit of £77 million  with an adjusted return on equity of 29.9% for the year.  The scheme’s developer Curlew is responsible for nearly 10,000 UK student beds. It is a privately-owned, non-listed development and investment management company that specialises in student accommodation and build to rent in the UK and the Netherlands. It is part of a complex group of companies of which at least 73 are registered off-shore in Guernsey.  One of the company’s senior development managers, who joined it in April 2020, was previously responsible for the development of controversial 360-bed student blocks behind Exeter City Football Club’s ground at St James Park and another 150 bedspaces at Exeter Cricket Club’s ground on Prince of Wales Road (150+ beds), which were developed by Yelverton Properties, itself part of a complex group of companies. The company was also responsible for the Printworks PBSA on Western Way (500+ beds).  The developer’s agent, Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL), is an American commercial real estate and investment management services company which has around 93,000 employees in 80 countries and global revenues of about $18 billion. It has 30 offices in the UK including one on Southernhay in Exeter.  Exeter City Council made payments of over £210,000 to the firm in a two year period from February 2018, notably for its involvement in the Clifton Hill sports centre redevelopment plans. The largest payment of £95,000 was made in August 2019.Whether or not the Harlequins redevelopment plans would mean more mass city centre student accommodation (and a hotel) and however valuable the slipperiness of co-living as a concept from the developer’s perspective, there is a more fundamental issue that must be addressed in considering any application for planning permission on this site.Exeter City Council’s inability to demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites means that a presumption in favour of development applies to most planning applications for residential accommodation in the city. Such applications do not pass automatically, but are generally granted.However, in this case, the Harlequins shopping centre’s location in a conservation area, where it is surrounded by a wide range of important heritage assets, means that the proposals have to pass a “non-weighted balance test” before the presumption in favour of development would even be considered. The city council planning officer made this clear in his report to the planning committee.He went on to explain that if, and only if, “there is no significant adverse impact when considering policies for the protection of heritage against other policies” the absence of a five year land supply would mean a presumption in favour of sustainable development would apply.Harm to heritage assetsThe city planning officer cited several key paragraphs in his report which specify how to consider potential impacts on heritage assets, including section sixteen of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) which addresses conservation and enhancement of the historic environment.Interpretation of NPPF is also directed by Planning Practice Guidance and further guided by relevant case law. Other national policies are also relevant in this case, such as Department for Transport cycle infrastructure design guidance, as are various Exeter Local Plan policies.Historic buildings on Upper Paul Street facing RAMMThere are a great many heritage assets in the vicinity of the Harlequins shopping centre site. These include Rougemont Castle and the Roman, Anglo-Saxon and mediaeval city walls, which are scheduled monuments, the grade I listed Cathedral Church of St Peter and Church of St Michael and All Saints, and the grade II* listed Civic Hall Higher Market, St Bartholomew’s cemetery, War Memorial and No.1 Upper Paul Street.There are numerous grade II listed buildings nearby, notably including the Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM), Iron Bridge and the City Gate Hotel. Northernhay and Rougemont Gardens are also grade II listed.In addition more than fifty nearby houses, shops and other buildings on Queen Street, Upper Paul Street, Gandy Street, Northernhay Street and Northernhay Square, Waterbeer Street, Lower North Street and St David’s Hill are grade II listed, as are parts of St Bartholomew’s churchyard and cemetery and the gate piers of the former marbleworks on Northernhay Street.Other nearby buildings are locally listed, including The Rougemont Hotel, Elim Providence Chapel and several more houses on Northernhay Street, which one resident described as “one of the few remaining streets in the historic core of Exeter with family houses which are still being used as such”. The site is inside Exeter’s Central Conservation Area and borders the St David’s Conservation Area.Historic buildings on Northernhay Street looking towards City Gate HotelHistoric England is a public body which must be consulted by law where development applications concern the historic environment. It said its response to the Harlequins application was principally concerned with the scheduled monuments, Grade I and Grade II* listed heritage assets and the conservation areas, and that the council should seek its own specialist advice on other heritage assets including those that are Grade II and locally listed.It nevertheless urged the council to follow the approach laid out in its Setting of Heritage Assets guidance by assessing the significance of historic buildings and open spaces in their contexts because “the scale and mass of the proposed development” had “potential impacts” which it considered to be “varied and wide reaching”.This recommendation was a response to what it called the “tabular and atomised” heritage impact assessment approach adopted by the Harlequins scheme developer. It said “this approach fails to properly engage with the nature of the asset’s significance and their relationships with each other, or the surrounding topographic landscape”, adding “the use of matrices tends to confuse the concepts of significance, sensitivity and magnitude of impact whilst atomising complex relationships between features and apparent impacts.“Consequently we have concerns about its use in cases with multiple assets with complex relationships, such as in the case of this application.” Historic England also said: “Due to the number of assets affected the cumulative impact needs to be considered, which will be greater than the independent elements”.However Exeter City Council’s heritage officer ignored these recommendations in his report, instead relying on the heritage impact assessment approach adopted by the developer. He said he did so “in order that the applicant’s assessments can be directly compared using the same scale”.This approach meant that his report, on which the planning officer’s recommendation to approve the development relied, individually graded the harm to each of the many heritage assets in the vicinity of the Harlequins redevelopment site, as well as both conservation areas, on a seven point scale from neutral to substantial without considering their relationships with each other.Several designated heritage assets which are affected by the proposals were also ignored, according to The Georgian Group, a registered heritage conservation charity which also objected to the plans.  NPPF Paragraph 193  “When considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.”  NPPF Paragraph 194  “Any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification. Substantial harm to or loss of: (a) grade II listed buildings, or grade II registered parks or gardens, should be exceptional; (b) assets of the highest significance, notably scheduled monuments, protected wreck sites, registered battlefields, grade I and II* listed buildings, grade I and II* registered parks and gardens, and World Heritage Sites, should be wholly exceptional.”In adopting this approach the heritage officer failed to follow a 2019 High Court ruling concerning the assessment of levels of harm in applying heritage policies, in which the court held that there are only three gradations of harm in heritage terms: substantial, less than substantial and no harm.The court also held that even limited or negligible harm was enough to fall within the “less than substantial” harm category. The judge said: “The fact that the harm may be limited or negligible will plainly go to the weight to be given to it as recognised in Paragraph 193 NPPF. However, in my judgment, minimal harm must fall to be considered within the category of less than substantial harm.”The heritage officer’s report acknowledged that “the proposed development will have an impact upon the setting of the designated and non-designated assets” and “will generate some harm to heritage assets” but did not explicitly weigh individual assets according to their importance, or clearly and convincingly justify the harm it did acknowledge would occur.It did not adopt a contextual approach to the “multiple assets with complex relationships” that are affected by the redevelopment proposals, nor did it attempt to analyse the cumulative impact of the harm to individual heritage assets it did include.Historic buildings on Lower North Street overlooking Iron BridgeThe heritage officer’s report also said that “any such harm must be acknowledged and measured against the value of the asset and any benefits the proposal will bring under wider policy requirements”, relying on NPPF Paragraph 196, which says: “Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.”The positive heritage effects identified in the report include archeological investigation during demolition and construction works, the creation of improved public realm around the new buildings and the construction of an “interpretation centre” intended to “enhance public engagement” with the city wall.Exeter city wallDuring the planning consultation process Devon archaeologist Stuart Blaycock, author of a major study of Exeter’s historic city wall, focused attention on the condition of the 160 metre section beside the development site. He said Historic England had listed the city wall on its register of monuments at risk in 2018 after “increasing neglect” which had followed the cessation of regular maintenance inspections in 2010.He said the justice of this move was “amply demonstrated” by the sudden collapse of a section of wall backing onto the yard of the City Gate Hotel in January 2019, and described the proposals to maintain a gap of no more than 50 centimetres between the Harlequins redevelopment works and the line of the city wall as “unbelievable”.Historic England said “early consideration will need to be given to the potential impact of vibration on the wall through the construction phase” because “the monument is fragile”. Subsequent reports into the condition of the wall commissioned by the developers, which included a conservation appraisal, an environmental and conservation impact assessment and an overview of its structural condition all found “significant issues that continue to contribute to its deterioration” and which require attention.All the reports emphasised their limited, preliminary scope, particularly since the surveys on which each was based were limited to examining a 40 metre section on the north side of the wall which happens to be accessible via the Northernhay Street car park. The remaining 120 metres on that side are in private gardens.Exeter city wall through Northernhay Street car park marbleworks gate pillarsOne report said a “much more detailed schedule and specification would have to be drawn up” in order for required remedial conservation works to take place. Another said its “examination was limited” to areas which were accessible, but nevertheless concluded that water exposure was “likely to have an ongoing deleterious effect”.Comprehensive repointing and repair of sections of the wall, the replacement of defective capping and installation of new soft capping and improvements to surface and below ground water drainage to direct water away from the wall were all recommended.The third report said the situation on the north side in the car park section “is not good, with localised collapses being a real possibility, with little warning”, identifying potential instability and bowing masonry “which could fail at any time in the near future” the causes of which “can only be identified by further accurate survey work and detailed investigations into the wall make up, possibly using borescopes combined with ground penetrating radar techniques”.A combined summary report noted that Exeter City Council had already erected fencing to block off parking spaces where collapse looked likely, as well as closing the Maddocks Row arch.The structural surveyors recommended a “full assessment of the wall’s stability over its full length” before any construction work begins on site, adding “vibrations from demolition works, and the new construction work itself, with major groundworks and piling could cause - or be said to cause - damage to the wall, notably in the areas which are already of concern”.They recommended protective measures including the erection of temporary shoring, the installation of a vibration monitoring system to prevent the impact of works exceeding agreed limits, a demolition method which avoids heavy loads impacting with the ground and a non-driven piling system for subsequent construction. They also recommended an exclusion zone on the redevelopment site to prevent heavy plant or machinery movement and materials being stockpiled too close to the wall.Heras fencing in front of an unsafe section of Exeter city wall in Northernhay Street car parkA city council officer responded to the structural survey by also recommending that the north-facing sections of the wall that had not been surveyed “should really be assessed at this stage as well and included in the review, so that a near as possible full review of the whole section of wall, front and rear, rather than just a partial one restricted to the publicly accessible sections, is available in the run up to the planning committee and decision”. He added that the proposed investigations and precautionary measures should also be completed “before the final details are submitted for approval”.Historic England, also responding to these reports, said: “The council will need to be confident that sufficient resources are allocated to the wall’s conservation based on an accurate estimate of the work. We understand that there has been discussion regarding the provision of a lump sum from the applicant to the council for the necessary repairs to the wall.“We would encourage that any lump sum is based on a detailed understanding of the extent of works and that this is used to inform the value and costs related to the scheme. We note from the documents that they recommend that further structural assessment is undertaken. It would seem appropriate to ensure that this detailed assessment is undertaken initially to inform any detailed costed specification on which basis a final sum can be agreed.”None of the recommended assessments, including detailed estimates of the cost of the mitigation works, were provided to the city council planning committee which decided the application. Nor were any of the recommended precautionary works carried out before its meeting.A contribution of just £25,000 towards “the management, maintenance, repair and promotion of the city wall as a public asset and resource” was suggested by city council officers on the basis of a “discussion”. No clarification over who will meet the costs of the recommended works in excess of this sum has been provided, and the Construction and Environmental Management Plan for the development has yet to be agreed.Exeter city wall behind private gardens in Northernhay StreetDespite identifying harm to both conservation areas, the cathedral and St Michael’s church, the city wall and all of the Grade II*, Grade II and locally listed buildings and open spaces it considered, the city council heritage officer’s report concluded, on the basis that “the proposal also has positive effects upon heritage” that the cumulative level of harm “falls below the threshold of substantial” defined in national guidance.No comparative analysis of cumulative harm vs benefits was included. The city council planning officer instead dismissed many of the historic environment representations from conservation charities and members of the public, saying: “the comments on the impact on heritage assets disagree with the professional views of the council’s heritage officer and the conclusions of the report”.Phil Bialyk said: “I am convinced this development will have a positive impact on the conservation area” and suggested that the development would “enhance Exeter’s position as a premier retail and cultural destination”. Conservative councillor Keith Sparkes agreed, saying the development would be “an improvement to the area”.Maddocks Row arch in Exeter city wall adjoining historic housing on Northernhay StreetMatilda Harden of The Georgian Group said: “While the applicant seems to believe this development will amount to ‘less than substantial harm’, it must be noted that this is still harm and it has not been justified to meet paragraph 194 of the NPPF. The amendments completely fail to take any heritage concerns into consideration.“We continue to firmly object to this scheme which will cause harm to an historic part of Exeter. It continues to be of a completely inappropriate scale and massing and the failure of the applicant to respond adequately to comments is unacceptable.”Olivia Stockdale of The Victorian Society, a registered Victorian and Edwardian heritage conservation charity, said: “Despite alterations to the proposal, we note that the contextually inappropriate scale of the development remains, and the scheme would therefore still cause significant harm. Under the provisions of the NPPF, we consider this to amount to less than substantial harm, as does the applicant.“Where we differ, however, is that we fail to see that the inevitable less than substantial harm to two conservation areas, several listed buildings and a scheduled monument has been justified in a ‘clear and convincing’ manner as specified under paragraph 194. We are moreover firmly unconvinced that any harm can be ‘weighed against the public benefits of the proposal’ (paragraph 196) and considered to be acceptable.”Harlequins co-living and hotel block elevations compared with Northernhay Street housing. Source: LHC Design.Had the harm to heritage assets been assessed in accordance with Historic England’s recommendations, the requirements of the National Planning Policy Framework and relevant High Court rulings, it would still have had to be clearly and convincingly justified. Neither the developer nor the city council’s heritage officer established such a justification.Had they done so, the proposals would still have had to pass the “non-weighted balance test” by demonstrating that their public benefits outweighed the harm they would cause. However, in contrast with the attention paid to the impact on heritage assets on one side of the “non-weighted balance test” by Exeter City Council’s officers, many of the claimed economic, social and environmental benefits of the Harlequins redevelopment received very little scrutiny.The key to assessing the “non-weighted balance test”, according to the city council, is whether the benefits of the redevelopment outweigh any potential harm it may cause, including to heritage assets. If not, the council’s inability to demonstrate a five year supply of development land would not be relevant and the application should be refused.  “We continue to firmly object to this scheme which will cause harm to an historic part of Exeter. It continues to be of a completely inappropriate scale and massing and the failure of the applicant to respond adequately to comments is unacceptable.”  Matilda Harden, The Georgian GroupAs Historic England said in June, the council would need “to ensure that great weight (NPPF Paragraph 193) is given to the significance of the heritage assets affected in order to deliver a sustainable scheme that offers balance in historic environment terms to provide a sustainable development as outlined in NPPF Paragraph 8”.Section seven of the planning officer’s report listed all the proposed scheme’s claimed benefits, including the heritage benefits on which the heritage officer also relied in his report. But these benefits cannot be counted twice, on both sides of the “non-weighted balance test”.The planning officer nevertheless included them in what he collectively described as “public benefits”, which he said “could be anything that delivers economic, social or environmental objectives as described in the NPPF”.  NPPF Paragraph 8  Achieving sustainable development means that the planning system has 3 overarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be pursued in mutually supportive ways (so that opportunities can be taken to secure net gains across each of the different objectives):            an economic objective – to help build a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the right places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved productivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure              a social objective – to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by ensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering a well-designed and safe built environment, with accessible services and open spaces that reflect current and future needs and support communities’ health, social and cultural well-being; and              an environmental objective – to contribute to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use of land, helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources prudently, minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low carbon economy.      Economic, social &amp;amp; environmental benefits?The first of the sustainable development objectives defined in NPPF Paragraph 8 is centred on support for growth, innovation and improved productivity. To what extent would the proposed Harlequins redevelopment deliver these?Exeter’s housing affordability crisisExeter became the sixth least affordable city in the UK in 2018 after several years of falling wages combined with rapidly-rising housing costs to price all but the most affluent out of home ownership.Between 2010 and 2018 average weekly workplace earnings fell by more than 10%, among the worst performers in the Centre for Cities index. During the same period the city’s average house price increased by more than 38%.As a result, Exeter’s affordability ratio increased by nearly 30%, making only London, Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton and Bournemouth less affordable places to live.Housing affordability ratio 2018. Source: Centre for Cities.The affordability problems that come with high housing costs and low wages are one of the principal causes of lagging UK growth, innovation and productivity. And Exeter is consistently well below national averages on metrics used to measure these goals, including the number of business startups per 10,000 people, GDP per worker and the proportion of privately-owned knowledge-intensive business services in the city.Co-living developers seek to position it as a solution to rising unaffordability, despite its defining characteristic being disproportionately high rents for disproportionately small rooms. Researchers have found that co-living charges per square metre are typically more than double those for “traditional” build to rent one-bed accommodation.Fresh Property Group, whose management plan for the proposed Harlequins co-living block was submitted with the redevelopment application, manages three other, similar student accommodation blocks in Exeter, one of which is on Queen Street, a few hundred yards from the Harlequins site. Studios there start at £949 per month for 51 week lets. Cluster flat bedspaces at Cricket Field Court, which it also manages, start at £823 per month on the same basis (the Queen Street block does not include these).However UK co-living scheme charges are typically higher for stays of less than a year. Old Oak, the block cited as an example by JLL as part of the Harlequins application, charges a premium of just over 15% for studios and 25% for cluster flat bedspaces for stays of less than twelve months, so Harlequins co-living rents might reasonably be expected to start at around £1000 per month for cluster flat bedspaces and around £1100 per month for studios for the minimum three month stays specified in the management plan.And unlike other co-living projects which typically include amenities and services such as room cleaning or bed linen laundry in the rent, these will be optional extras at Harlequins. Nor will there be a bar, restaurant or gym in the building.At rates more than double those of local private sector rents, the proposed co-living block would not address Exeter’s housing affordability problems, or the drags on growth, innovation and productivity that come with them, but it might very well make them worse.Economic impactThe economic impact assessment submitted with the Harlequins redevelopment proposals identified Exeter’s largest economic sectors as health, education, retail and business support. However it overlooked the city’s public administration sector despite local economic activity running at almost double the national rate in this area, and ignored the fact that Exeter’s health, education and public administration sectors are almost entirely dependent on public spending.Exeter has one of the lowest levels of private sector jobs in the country, and one of the lowest ratios of private to public sector employment. It is seventh from bottom in the Centre for Cities index on both metrics. Instead of recognising that Exeter’s economy is largely dependent on public sector activity, the economic impact assessment based its conclusions on the assertion that Exeter is “mainly dominated by businesses in the tertiary sector, which benefits from consumer and local business spending” of the sort likely to be associated with the proposed Harlequins redevelopment.Ratio of private to public sector employment 2018. Source: Centre for Cities.The economic impact assessment estimated the benefits of spending by co-living block residents by relying on Office of National Statistics household expenditure figures for the average one-person non-retired household across the whole of the UK, then adding a South West regional weighting. This produced a spending estimate of £366.63 per person per week, or just over £19,000 per annum. The 251 proposed co-living block residents were thus estimated to be worth just under £4.8 million each year.However the figure for average single person household expenditure, with regional weighting, allows just £305 per month for housing costs, which is less than a third of the expected starting rate of £1000 per month for cluster flat bedspaces and less still compared with the £1100 per month the Harlequins studios are expected to cost. The economic impact assessment made no attempt to estimate cluster flat bedspace or studio charges, instead simply describing the development as “affordable”.Nowhere in any of the published proposals are these critically important figures provided, and nothing was said about prospective rent levels in the co-living block at the planning committee meeting which decided the application. At such rates, around two thirds of the £19,000 each co-living resident is expected to spend each year would be swallowed by rent. This is double the average proportion in the South West.In addition, letting agents typically require that prospective tenants earn an annual gross salary equal to at least 30 months of rental charges, so eligibility for a cluster flat bedspace at £1000 per month requires a salary of £30,000 a year, and a studio at £1100 per month a salary of £33,000. But average annual earnings in Exeter are just under  £25,800, well below the national average of £28,700 which is still not enough to afford a co-living cluster flat bedspace at these rates.And full-time minimum wage workers between eighteen and twenty years of age earn just over £12,500 each year, rising to £17,000 by the time they are 25. How many young, single employees in Exeter’s health, education or local government sectors are earning enough to afford co-living?Average weekly workplace earnings change 2010-2018. Source: Centre for Cities.The economic impact assessment also states that 100% of housing costs are extracted from the local economy in which they are paid, and that the proportion of each resident’s overall aggregate expenditure that stays in the local economy is just 60%. Removing a realistic estimate of housing costs from the £19,000 each co-living block resident is expected to spend each year means a dramatic fall in the residual sum spent locally, leaving just £111.78 per person per week, or a total just over £1,450,000 each year for the whole block, 30% of the sum claimed by the developer.Following the economic impact assessment methodology, this has the consequence of reducing the co-living block’s operational expenditure-driven job creation value to just over seven  net jobs, and its net additional annual Gross Value Added to the Exeter economy to just over £220,000, less than half the amount claimed.The operational viability and economic value of the proposed hotel was also calculated by relying on averages. These were sourced from a fourteen year-old study of the Exeter hotel market and four year-old national survey-based estimates of tourism activity. The tourism activity report says: “The methodology and accuracy of these sources varies, and therefore the estimates can only be regarded as indicative. Because of the data sources and modelling process, there will be a potentially large margin of error associated with individual figures, with small numbers being particularly prone to such errors.”The six tourism surveys used each relied on multiplying small survey samples to produce national figures which were then combined before being subdivided again into regional then subregional figures. This methodology has not been independently validated since 1994.The economic impact assessment then took each of these figures and further subdivided them, compounding the factor by which a small error would be magnified. It ignored the decade-long gap between the two sources, then took two further averages and multiplied them all together to produce the headline figure which was reproduced in the planning officer’s report: a total annual visitor expenditure figure of £3.5 millionHowever variations of just 15% in each of the estimates combine to reduce this to  £1,844,000, only just over half the amount claimed. And this is without allowing for the 25% of visitor expenditure which the assessment states will not be spent in Exeter or the 50% that would be displaced from other hotels in the city, which together further reduce the figure to £461,000.In addition, were the hotel were to fail, or no operator be found, as none had been by the time the city council planning committee met to approve the development, there would be nothing to prevent the owners repurposing it as co-living or student accommodation beyond a simple change of use class.Average house price change 2010-2018. Source: Centre for Cities.The economic benefits that were initially claimed for the development were subsequently revised down to reflect changes to the proposals, then revised down again following further changes, although these later revisions did not make it into the city council planning officer’s report. And this dramatically overstated the development economic benefits by presenting the headline investment and expenditure figures from the impact assessment without the qualifying explanations that accompanied them, which made clear that the benefits it estimated for the city were far smaller.So the fact that a significant proportion of the operational spending associated with the development would not benefit Exeter’s economy was not mentioned, nor was the likelihood that compound errors in research sources and estimate variances would produce figures orders of magnitude smaller than those that were presented.Neither was the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the economic estimates considered in the planning officer’s report or at the planning committee meeting, despite the applicant’s agent acknowledging in a revised planning statement that “some of the assumptions about future economic activity, such as visitor numbers and spending, will be impacted”.The statement went on to say the impact would only be short term, claiming that “it is anticipated that in the long term figures will return to pre-COVID levels” without supplying any evidence to support this claim.It also amended the applicant’s previous claims about post-pandemic job creation and local expenditure. The co-living block and hotel now had the “potential” to generate expenditure and the development “might” create jobs which “might” add to the local economy.The statement nevertheless concluded that the development “clearly achieves the economic objective of achieving sustainable development, as set out in the NPPF Paragraph 8”.Housing affordability ratio change 2010-2018. Source: Centre for Cities.The second sustainable development objective defined in NPPF Paragraph 8 is centred on meeting present and future housing needs while upholding design and amenity standards. To what extent would the proposed Harlequins redevelopment satisfy these criteria?Space standardsThe government introduced national minimum space standards as part of a 2015 housing review which was incorporated in planning decisions under the National Planning Policy Framework. The new “nationally described space standard” requires minimum floor areas for dwellings of different sizes based on the number of people they accommodate. It also specifies minimum widths for bedrooms and minimum floor areas for storage, which it says are “an integral part of the space standard” and “cannot be used in isolation from other parts of the design standard or removed from it”.The proposed Harlequins co-living block would contain 26 cluster flats, with between four and seven bedspaces in each, as well as 99 studio flats of which fourteen are designed to be accessible to wheelchair users, altogether providing 251 bedspaces. There is no indication in the application documents that sharing bedspaces will be prohibited. As studios in the Queen Street block managed by Fresh Property Group are advertised as suitable for sharers there seems no reason to expect the Harlequins bedspaces to be limited to single occupation.None of the proposed Harlequins cluster flats or studios would meet the national minimum space standard, whether singly-occupied or otherwise. According to the submitted plans, the cluster flat bedspaces would be typically 2.5 metres wide by 5 metres long, including a corner shower and toilet space, while the studios would be typically 3 metres wide by 6 metres long, including a corner shower space and toilet as well as a kitchenette.The national minimum space standard for a one person dwelling is 37 square metres (if it has a shower instead of a bath). At 18 square metres the studios would be less than half this size, and smaller than a typical single garage.The cluster flat plans do not include the required storage space and do not meet the minimum room width requirement. Nor do their designs recognise that the minimum standards for dwellings intended to accommodate several people are not intended to include the long corridors which are a feature of the flats in the proposed block. One six bedroom fifth floor flat shown on the plans includes a corridor that consumes more than 21 square metres of its internal space.Harlequins co-living block first floor plan (excluding studios over shops on Queen Street). Source: LHC Design.Despite the clarity of the government guidance, the city council planning officer’s report said: “Officers do not consider that the local or national space standards should be applied to co-living housing schemes, as they are not standard dwelling types.”Phil Bialyk said: “the development provides greater space standards than apply in respect of the conversion of office buildings to residential”, favourably comparing it to the “slums of the future” created by permitted development rights, of which 22% nevertheless meet national minimum space standards. He was apparently unaware that the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities &amp;amp; Local Government announced in September that the national minimum space standard also now applies to all homes delivered on this basis.Labour councillor Laura Wright, who is Executive Portfolio holder for Council Housing Development and Services, said: “It’s the size of these units that is really, really worrying me. To put it into context, the average Travelodge bedroom space is 27.8 square metres. I don’t think living in a Travelodge-equivalent space for any length of time is acceptable.”Keith Lewis said: “The quality and size of the co-living accommodation are sub-standard and akin to student living rather than providing quality accommodation for working people for whom it would be a more permanent home. Living spaces should be better than the equivalent of a hotel room. Approval of such small living spaces will set a dangerous precedent.”Diana Moore added: “The report sets out no reason for the recommended departure from the nationally described space standards. We have to remember these are intended as primary, permanent homes not accommodation for nine months.”Amenity &amp;amp; flexibilityThe city council planning officer sought to justify the proposed co-living block’s failure to meet the national space standard on the grounds that its residents “would have the benefit of shared facilities”, which he emphasised would be provided on all floors of the building. Following reductions to amenity space included in previous plan iterations, these facilities amount to two rooms on the lower ground floor of the block, two more on the ground floor, and one each on the upper ground and first to fifth floors, all of which would also be kitchens.If the building’s 251 bedspaces were limited to one occupant each, this would offer each resident an extra 2.7 square metres of space. However on several upper floors only 42 square metres of amenity space would be shared between more than 50 bedspaces. The planning officer’s report also failed to mention that the proposed co-living management plan said that the building’s communal spaces would be available for private hire.In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, not only would these combined communal spaces be limited to supplying safely-distanced space for just 53 people in total, the floor plans show long corridors which are only 1.5 metres wide and so too narrow to pass others at a safe distance. Each of the first to fourth floors includes a 22 metre corridor which services eleven studio and two cluster flats, one with six bedrooms and another with seven. If singly-occupied, this would mean 24 people using each of these corridors to access their bedspaces.Chris Dadds sought to reassure public consultation respondents who suggested that “the small personal spaces and shared facilities will be a potential breeding ground for future outbreaks” by saying that, in the advent of another pandemic, the Harlequins co-living block “would have a management team dedicated to ensuring the safety of residents and would work with the resident community to put in place measures around social distancing”.Average change in space per resident 2011-2018. Source: Centre for Cities.During the past decade space per person in Exeter’s residential accommodation has fallen at a rate among the fastest in the country. This is despite city council planning policies including a Residential Design Guide, which was introduced in 2010 to define the council’s minimum design standards for new residential development. As well as setting space standards (which the Harlequins redevelopment proposals do not meet), the policy defines “fit for purpose” building design which it says applies to “all dwellings” and “will be applied consistently”.It says: “Without minimum standards, private house builders tend to minimise room sizes so reducing flexibility and adaptability. As the pressure for increased densities grows the requirement for minimum standards is ever more important. All dwellings, including conversions, should have sufficient space to create comfortable homes, without people living on top of each other.“They should be adaptable to occupiers’ changing needs over time, and have sufficient space and storage to accommodate sufficient furniture and equipment to enable comfortable living. Space standards are an important factor in delivering sustainable development.”In her foreword to the guide, Labour councillor Rachel Sutton, who was then Executive Portfolio Holder for Sustainable Development and Transport, said: “Houses and flats should be built to last, have generous space to meet the requirements of modern living and be adaptable as people’s needs change through life.” She said the guide “clearly outlines the criteria by which all housing proposals are assessed, from an individual house to the largest estate”.The guide goes on to say it “explains the principles that developers should adopt and the procedures that should be followed to meet the challenge of designing higher density development without compromising design quality or residential amenity. Recent trends in house building have seen the development of some dwellings which are far too small to be sustainable. These designs are inflexible and not able to meet the changing needs of people over time.”Harlequins co-living block lower ground floor plan showing amenity space. Image: LCH Design.Exeter’s Local Plan also includes a Residential Layout and Amenity policy which stipulates that “residential development should ensure a quality of amenity which allows residents to feel at ease within their homes and gardens”. In a planning statement accompanying the Harlequins redevelopment application, JLL claimed that “this relates to the concept of a more traditional housing model, which the co-living approach does not adhere to”, and said that “personal outside amenity space is not a requirement” for the co-living model, in which “residents utilise the wider city spaces for their informal recreation, rather than more traditional gardens”.The statement went on to say: “The amenity spaces provided for those living within the co-living accommodation is [sic] therefore reflective of the needs of the occupiers and the community they live in”. It did not explain how the 2.7 square metres of communal space provided per bedspace addresses the amenity requirements set out in the council’s planning policies, or how the design of the co-living block makes it adaptable to its occupiers’ changing needs over time.At the planning committee meeting that approved the Harlequins proposals, Rachel Sutton described the city as “moving into a new phase” with the redevelopment, saying “life is a lot easier” when you can “move from one rented flat or bedsit to another in the back of your mate’s car because your possessions probably fit into a couple of bin bags”. She continued: “There are young people, frankly, the last thing they want is a garden.”Labour councillor Rob Hannaford, who is a member of the planning committee, said: “The idea that any of us should be satisfied with our young people having a life that can be scooped up in two bin bags is not the vision that I have for our young people or Exeter. I am concerned with the longer term implications for some of our younger people, who this development seems to be marketed at. They could be in these units for months if not years.”The council planning officer nevertheless considered the quality of amenity in the proposed block to be “acceptable”.  “The idea that any of us should be satisfied with our young people having a life that can be scooped up in two bin bags is not the vision that I have for our young people or Exeter.”  Rob Hannaford, Exeter councillorHousing needDespite the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic, particularly for retail-oriented city centres such as Exeter’s as the shift towards online shopping has accelerated, the developer not only claimed that “there is a demand within Exeter for bespoke new high-quality, managed rental accommodation” which the “proposed co-living accommodation will meet”, but that this demand has increased since the advent of COVID-19.No evidence was supplied to support either of these claims, although the developer did provide substantive evidence of the demand for student accommodation in Exeter at the initial public consultation, saying the city needs 8000 more student beds.The application documents instead presented the proposal to supply co-living accommodation as evidence of demand for its provision, using statements such as “the background to co-living remains the same, which is for high density living aimed specifically at those, typically young professionals, who are seeking good quality, well located accommodation which is centrally managed”.Phil Bialyk echoed these claims at the October planning committee meeting which decided the application, when he said: “There is evidence, in my view, that there is a demand for this type of co-living”. We asked Exeter City Council for evidence of such demand in Exeter but it declined to supply any. We also asked Exeter City Council to identify local examples of bespoke new high-quality, managed rental accommodation that are not purpose built student accommodation, but it again declined to do so.Housing supplyIn addition to conflating supply with demand, the Harlequins developer claimed that the co-living block would increase the supply of housing in Exeter, not by delivering new housing itself, but by “freeing up existing capacity” and “reducing pressure on traditional houses in the city” to “free up these homes to allow families to live there, rebalancing the mix of communities in the area”.Claiming “significant parallels” with a 2019 appeal decision in which a planning inspector allowed the construction of a 166-bed student accommodation block at Walnut Gardens on St David’s Hill, the developer said the proposed Harlequins co-living block would contribute to the council’s housing delivery targets, which are set by the government, “through reallocation of some residents moving from established dwellings to the scheme”.However the Housing Delivery Test which the government uses to assess the extent to which development supplies housing to meet local targets explicitly refers to dwellings as defined in MHCLG guidance, which says: “A home or dwelling in the Housing supply; net additional dwellings statistics is defined in line with the census definition, which defines a dwelling as a self-contained unit of accommodation. Self-containment is where all the rooms (including kitchen, bathroom and toilet) in a household’s accommodation are behind a single door which only that household can use.”It continues: “Communal establishments, i.e. establishments providing managed residential accommodation, are not counted in overall housing supply”. Student accommodation is explicitly defined as a form of communal establishment, and the definition also says that purpose-built flats are only counted in housing supply calculations if they are separate, self-contained dwellings.The shared amenity and kitchen spaces on which the Harlequins proposals rely to justify their failure to meet minimum space, amenity and design standards entail that none of the planned cluster flats or studios qualify as separate, self-contained dwellings according to the government’s definition, and so would not be counted for the purposes of housing supply measurement. A dwelling cannot be both self-contained and dependent on communal space at the same time.Purpose Built Student Accommodation on Bampfylde StreetAn attempt by the developer’s agent to refute this definition made on the day of the planning committee meeting unintentionally pointed towards the pertinence of the government’s definition. The agent cited 2019 government guidance on the Housing Delivery Test, quoting the first sentence of a section concerning student accommodation: “All student accommodation, whether it consists of communal halls of residence or self-contained dwellings, and whether or not it is on campus, can in principle count towards contributing to an authority’s housing land supply.”However, apart from the fact that the developer insists that the Harlequins co-living block would not be student accommodation, which is the form of accommodation to which this guidance applies, the agent failed to quote the rest of the guidance, which included the qualification that it could apply to purpose-built studio flats, but only when they fully function as independent dwellings.In an appeal decision concerning a co-living block in Feltham earlier this year, a planning inspector clarified the functional characteristics necessary to qualify as an independent dwelling, which include the provision of private external space and independent access to and from each dwelling, as well as not relying on communal facilities such as shared kitchens.Despite the city council planning officer’s report supplying no evidence that the co-living block would contribute to housing supply numbers, and despite clear government guidance and case law to the contrary, the planning officer said that Exeter City Council nevertheless agreed with the developer’s claim that the co-living block would supply housing to meet its government-set delivery targets, and so counted this as one of the benefits of the application.Affordable housing provisionOn the basis that the co-living block would provide dwellings, the council planning officer then stated that the Exeter Core Strategy policy on the provision of affordable housing would apply. This says: “On sites capable of providing three or more additional dwellings (irrespective of the number of dwellings proposed) 35% of the total housing provision should be made available as affordable housing for households whose housing needs are not met by the market. At least 70% of the affordable housing should be provided as social rented housing.”Exeter also has an Affordable Housing policy which provides more detailed guidance on how the core strategy policy will be implemented. This says: “The requirement to provide affordable housing will apply to all proposals for residential development, including new build, conversions and mixed use schemes” as well as “schemes involving non-self contained dwellings and the sharing of amenities”.However, the council planning officer went to say that only 20% of the co-living block would need to be affordable housing, on the basis that the block constituted a Build To Rent development so specific NPPF guidance would apply instead. The NPPF considers Built to Rent as an “asset class within the private rented sector” and says that such schemes “should meet any relevant local and national planning policy requirements”.  “The sheer inability to be packaged and compartmentalised into an easily digestible definition is one of coliving’s greatest strengths.”  Richard Lustigman, JLL directorThe most commonly referred to definition of affordable housing is set out in the NPPF, which says the rent must be “at least 20% below local market rents”. The approval condition recommended by the planning officer does not prevent the scheme operator charging 80% of the rent levels in the rest of the block, which are likely to be double typical Exeter rates, as these would be the only other co-living rents in the city at the time of opening and so constitute the local market rents referred to in the definition.And the approval condition only gives “first priority” for these discounted bedspaces to essential local workers, which presumably means that others will be free to take them if key workers do not fill them as they become available. As one third of key workers earn £10 an hour or less and the lowest NHS pay band for a nurse is under £20,000 a year, the bedspaces are likely to remain unaffordable for most such workers in any case.Michael Mitchell, calling the development a “poorly thought through scheme” that “doesn’t constitute housing, or providing a home” said: “If this development had been about providing 20-30 year-olds with affordable rented housing in the city centre I’d have both hands in the air. It is not.”  Build to Rent or Sui generis?  Build to Rent is not a “use class” in its own right for planning purposes, so is usually dealt with under the C3 designation for residential dwellings.  Sui generis is a planning term for uses which are specifically defined and excluded from use classification by legislation. These include theatres, scrap yards and betting shops, among other things.  In practice, because of its identifiable differences with conventional residential housing, local authorities have often (although not always) chosen to categorise purpose build student accommodation blocks as sui generis in dealing with planning applications.  The situation is similarly confused with co-living. In all such cases it is up to local planning authorities to decide how to classify such applications.  The Harlequins developer insisted that the proposed co-living block would be sui generis despite JLL director Richard Lustigman describing his firm working on “numerous co-living opportunities that exist under different use classes, including both C3 (residential) and C4 (houses of multiple occupancy) as well as C1 (hotel).”  Why would the Harlequins developer insist that the co-living block should not be dealt with under “any of the established residential use classes” and so be considered sui generis? Because, as its statement says two sentences later, “there are no specific policies which relate to the use in any of the development plan documents, or indeed the NPPF”.  Bizarrely, having treated the proposed co-living block as Build to Rent for affordable housing allocation purposes, Exeter City Council’s planning department nevertheless accepted that the application was for sui generis use in all other respects.The third sustainable development objective defined in NPPF Paragraph 8 is centred on protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment and moving to a low carbon economy. To what extent would the proposed Harlequins redevelopment deliver these aims?StreetscapeA striking feature of the Harlequins site is the spiral vehicle ramp which feeds the Guildhall shopping centre multi-storey car park on the other side of Paul Street, described by Historic England as “cutting through the site”. The existing Harlequins development was constructed around this ramp when it was built in the mid-1980s, and the redevelopment plans have followed the same approach despite the existence of two street-level vehicle entrances to the Guildhall shopping centre on Paul Street.The decision to integrate the ramp into the Harlequins redevelopment appears to cement the Guildhall shopping centre multi-storey car park, and the poor quality public realm that comes with it, into the fabric of the city despite the commitment to replace it with human-scale street frontage including shops, offices and housing framed in the Exeter City Centre Vision for a Green Capital.The redevelopment proposals include moving the car park barrier to street level in order to reduce queueing on the ramp. The developer claimed this would reduce vehicle emissions, without explaining how, despite going on to say “the impact of the scheme would not be significant in air quality terms”. Keith Lewis said: “The proposed location [of the barrier] only allows for one car to queue before obtaining a ticket for entry. This could have a negative impact upon traffic in Paul Street if a small number of motorists are tempted to wait for the barrier to rise, and block through traffic.”Guildhall car park ramp entrance and exit at Harlequins shopping centreDevon County Council, responding to the application in its role as Local Highways Authority, said: “In the rare times when the car park becomes full additional signage would re-divert traffic elsewhere to other car parks in the city.” It described the use of signage as a “forward-thinking concept” which “would aim to change people’s behavioural patterns in the interest of creating a greener and more sustainable approach to how the public interaction [sic] with the city.”The proposals also include removing the car park queue filter lanes in both directions. The county council said, while acknowledging that vehicles waiting to enter the Guildhall car park currently queue on Paul Street at busy times, which would prevent other vehicles passing were the filter lanes to be removed, that vehicles would “be able to see the car park is full” and “move onto other car parks in the area”. It did not explain how those vehicles would pass queueing traffic to do so once the filter lanes had been removed.Guildhall car park ramp rear viewDespite acknowledging the “heavy traffic which moves up and down Paul Street” and “large number of heavy service vehicles using the road”, and that the development “is unlikely to have a perceivable effect on the day-to-day operation of Paul Street, Queen Street or the existing signalised junction”, the developer nevertheless claimed that the proposals “aim to reduce traffic flows along the highway” and their benefits included “reducing the presence of the car”.These claims appear to rest on plans to widen the pavements alongside the development and create raised crossover points in four places, including at the top of the street, having removed the car park filter lanes. The developer describes these changes as an opportunity to “significantly improve the highway along Paul Street in order to prioritise pedestrian movement along its length” and “reconfigure Paul Street and Queen Street junction to reduce traffic flows and reduce the conflict between pedestrian and vehicle movements creating a better pedestrian environment”.Pedestrians are expected to share the widened pavements with cyclists, despite Department for Transport design guidance published over the summer which says: “Shared use routes in streets with high pedestrian or cyclist flows should not be used.” It continues: “On urban streets, cyclists must be physically separated from pedestrians and should not share space with pedestrians. Where cycle routes cross pavements, a physically segregated track should always be provided. At crossings and junctions, cyclists should not share the space used by pedestrians but should be provided with a separate parallel route.”Guildhall car park ramp access filter lanes in Paul Street with ramp flyover in backgroundAlex Tait of Exeter Cycling Campaign said: “The shared path proposed alongside the development is no longer compliant with national design guidance”. In a detailed response to the scheme, Exeter Cycling Campaign proposed extending the existing Queen Street pedestrian zone to the top of Northernhay Street, with the closure of the top of Paul Street to through traffic to create a plaza in front of RAMM.However Devon County Council rejected Exeter Cycling Campaign’s concerns about the new government design guidance, saying “shared use may be appropriate in some situations, such as at and around junctions where cyclists are generally moving at slow speed, and in situations where high cycle and high pedestrian flows occur at different times”.The county council did not supply any evidence that such flows would occur at different times on Paul Street, or address the issue that the proposed shared route alongside the development is not situated at a junction. Nor did it respond to the cycling campaign’s street closure proposals.Public realmIn its initial response to the Harlequins redevelopment plans, Historic England said: “The works to the streetscape have been viewed as offering an opportunity to enhance this section of the conservation area through the elevation of the pedestrian over the car and the setting back of the buildings to open up the street. Although the building will be set back it will nonetheless be significantly taller than the existing structure, and therefore, the visual relief offered by the lower form of the existing Harlequin Centre will be lost.”Despite subsequent revisions, the plans still include a seven storey tower which would be three storeys taller than the Guildhall shopping centre beside it. Exeter City Council’s planning officer nevertheless described the proposed redevelopment as “a stepping stone between the very large grain of the Guildhall shopping centre to the south and the fine grain of the residential areas to the north and west”, and the developer claimed it would reduce the existing Paul Street “canyon effect”.Harlequins co-living block elevation showing Guildhall car park ramp and ‘urban oasis garden’. Image: LHC Design.The redevelopment proposals include the creation of a “pocket park” at the North Street end of the site, which would replace the existing surface level car park and would include a “stump garden of inverted tree stumps set amongst an area of lush wildlife-friendly planting”. It would be linked to a new footpath, which would be planted as a “green ribbon” alongside the section of city wall which borders the site.The area underneath the Guildhall car park ramp would become part of what the developer describes as an “urban oasis garden” which would “include an entirely new area of public realm of unique character and appearance” where new planting would “take advantage of the uniquely sheltered micro-climate and shading created by the existing car park ramp and adjacent proposed development structures which over sail parts of the space”.Its “biophilic design” would create a “restorative space within the noise and activity of the city centre”. The city wall “interpretation centre” would be located here too, behind a car park ramp support. It would be just 4 metres wide and 5 metres deep. While this is larger than the co-living block studios it is still smaller than a typical single garage.Exeter city wall “interpretation centre”. Image: Design &amp;amp; Access Statement.In addition, a green wall would be introduced on the north-west hotel block elevation which would take twenty years to establish (Historic England expressed concerns about its viability) and some of the development roofspace would be planted with sedum, which would be beneficial for wildlife. Bird and bat boxes would also be installed.An ecology assessment report commissioned by the developer produced the striking claim that these improvements, taken together, would produce a net biodiversity improvement of 616%. However, as the biodiversity value of the existing few shrubs and small trees is just 0.18 “biodiversity units”, and would increase to 1.26 units, this headline percentage gain is only intelligible when presented in context, which it was not in the city council planning officer’s report.As is the norm in Exeter residential and commercial development, despite the city’s aspiration to be “recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”, neither the carbon emissions associated with demolition of the Harlequins shopping centre nor those associated with the construction of the proposed replacement buildings, which in this case rely on significant amounts of concrete in pilings, frames and cores, were considered in the planning officer’s report.Hotel green wall development over twenty years. Images: Design &amp;amp; Access Statement.So had the harm to heritage assets that the proposed redevelopment would cause been clearly and convincingly justified, would its claimed economic, social and environmental benefits be sufficiently significant to outweigh that harm? In other words, would it have passed the “non-weighted balance test”?Relying on the city council heritage officer’s conclusion there would be less than substantial harm to the setting of heritage assets, the city council planning officer’s report summarised the scheme’s principal benefits as follows: “  economic growth in the form of job creation and expenditure in the city centre  delivery of housing to help with the council’s lack of five year housing supply  provision of affordable housing  significant public realm improvement works along Paul Street and on the corner of Paul Street and Queen Street  improved public access and setting of the city wall, with ‘interpretation centre’  new architecturally distinctive/energy efficient buildings with active frontages facing onto Paul Street  biodiversity net gain of 616%  remediation of contaminated land; and  reduction in surface water flow from the site.”It also noted £25,000 contributions towards city wall management, maintenance, repair and promotion and £100,000 for “public open spaces within the area” to compensate for the lack of outdoor amenity space included in the development, but did not address the inclusion of heritage benefits on both sides of the “non-weighted balance test”.The report concluded that the “non-weighted balance test” had been satisfied, and said: “There are no adverse impacts of the scheme that are considered to significantly and demonstrably outweigh the economic, social and environmental benefits of the scheme when considering the NPPF as a whole.”Diana Moore said: “The harm caused to the setting of the heritage assets requires clear and convincing justification, but the developer has failed to justify the harm that will occur on the wider area and heritage assets. It is claimed the public benefits of the scheme outweigh this level of harm, but this has not been fully justified. In particular I am concerned at the number of times the report recommends setting aside material conflicts with national guidance, standards or the council’s own policies.”  “I am convinced this development will have a positive impact on the conservation area.”  Phil Bialyk, Exeter City Council leaderThe Harlequins redevelopment consultation generated 383 comments from the public, of which 99% were objections. John Allan said: “Like many Exeter residents I remain appalled by this greedy development proposal.” Rebecca Wells said: “It is a solid, brutal, overbearing block which could be anywhere. Such a building in the heart of Exeter is completely inappropriate.” Andrew Simson added: “The developers are obviously trying to cram as many people as possible into a very cramped environmment. The motivation for this is obviously to make as much money as possible and as fast as possible and can hardly be said to be in the interests of locals.”Vanessa Cecil said: “It would ruin a historic area of Exeter and render it no different from numerous other unattractive city centres. Not only is this utterly unwanted but it is unnecessary. Proper, decent housing is required, not units tantamount to student accommodation.” Jean Baker said: “We need housing for residents […] real accommodation for those who could help to regenerate this rapidly declining city. The de-facto outcome will be that the whole building will become student accommodation.”Marsha Hunt said: “Young residents are the future of our city. They deserve more than a space in a hall of residence to start their working life.” Penelope Dodd added: “Exeter is in danger of becoming a city of vast accommodation blocks. We should be enhancing these areas with mixed residential areas so that people can work, bring up families, bring back the heart to this city.”Dr Shaun Curtis said: “This city centre site is too sensitive for the imposition of featureless and derivative architecture, especially at the scale proposed. We need a completely different approach, where the development team is forced to think imaginatively about design and context, rather than returns on capital employed and the maximisation of residential development margins.”Indicative view of relative building heights from Guildhall car park top deck. Image: LHC Design.Residents launched a campaign, Save Our Historic Exeter, soon after the initial application was submitted and organised a petition which was signed by more than 4200 people (of whom over 2000 were Exeter residents). The petition was presented by organiser Andy Robinson on behalf of the campaign to the July city council meeting, where a full debate on the issue was expected in accordance with the city’s petition scheme. It was, however, controversially referred to the September planning committee meeting by the Lord Mayor on the grounds that Mr Robinson, in presenting the petition, had mentioned the planning application which was the petition’s subject.The petitioners urged the council to research and develop new policies to safeguard Exeter against inappropriate development, including a comprehensive housing needs assessment and policies to address affordable housing, co-living, student accommodation, conservation areas and heritage assets. Andy Robinson said: “There are huge gaps in planning policy. We have seen many buildings going up without any respect for historic Exeter, bringing no public benefit and only benefiting investors who are, in most cases, not based in our city and may not even be in the UK.“Exeter City Council, it seems, does not have the resources to give them proper scrutiny; developers’ claims and conclusions therefore have to be taken at face value and, inevitably, what is proposed is overwhelmingly about profit. It is not concerned about protecting Exeter, its heritage and its long term vision and it certainly is not about benefitting the people who live here.”Daniel Rudham, a resident who backed the petition, said: “The thousands who have signed the petition say: stop; listen to the people who live and work here. The council must make sure that there are planning rules to ensure Exeter develops in ways which protects our heritage and environment and addresses the needs of local people. It’s clear that the council lacks the resources and policies to deal with the threat of international developers taking advantage. But they need to make proper use of the powers they do have to ensure architecturally imaginative buildings worthy of a historically important city are built.”Joy Wrightson, a local resident, said: “Large new developments designed to make the developers rich but which bring little to the city in terms of amenity or architectural value are already beginning to dominate the central skyline. We want the council to have properly up to date policies so that control of planning isn’t always in the hands of the developers and consultation with residents is more than a tick box exercise.”Diana Moore, who presented the Save Our Historic Exeter petition to the planning committee in September, said: “4000 signatures demonstrate the strength of feeling on how thoughtless development is damaging our great city but not providing the homes we need. There is a growing feeling among Exeter residents that development isn’t benefiting people who live in the city or creating thriving communities.”Indicative view of outside amenity space beside co-living block lower ground floor. Image: LHC Design.Exeter City Council published a decision notice in August which said it would define its policy position on student accommodation and co-living at the October Executive committee meeting, and Phil Bialyk confirmed in September that a co-living policy was in prospect. Had the Executive done as planned, the city council would have ratified its decision at its meeting later that month, the week before the planning committee meeting that decided the Harlequins application was held.We asked Exeter City Council why this decision was not taken at the meetings as announced, and when it would be taken instead. We were told: “The matter was withdrawn as the appropriate way to develop new policy is through the local plan process and we will therefore be developing such a policy as part of the new local plan in due course.” We also asked why the development of this policy was not mentioned in the officer’s report to the planning committee, and were told: “The existing policy framework was set out within the report and provides the correct framework for determining the application.”However, the delivery of most of the planning policy documents that make up Exeter’s Local Development Scheme has been been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan stalled this summer, specific supplementary planning documents such as the Code for Sustainable Homes that was promised in 2019 have been “paused pending the outcome of the Government’s Future Homes Standard consultation” and the government is in the middle of a consultation on planning reform which threatens to turn the current system on its head, introducing a completely new local plan production and adoption process.  “If this development had been about providing 20-30 year-olds with affordable rented housing in the city centre I’d have both hands in the air. It is not.”  Michael Mitchell, Exeter councillorUnder the current system, it takes an average of nineteen months simply to adopt a local plan, with some taking as long as five years. And that is without factoring in multiple earlier stages in local plan development, which also take years. It would be foolhardy to bet on when a new Exeter Local Plan might be adopted, but it looks like a racing certainty that the city will not have adopted new policies on co-living or student accommodation at least until after the Harlequins redevelopment has been completed, which is currently scheduled for 2022.Diana Moore said: “This is the first co-living development to be determined by the council. The council does not have policies which provide a basis for determining a co-living application, which at this point is no more than an ill-defined brand. Other local planning authorities have sought to address this weakness by adopting specific co-living policies. There is no reason Exeter City Council should not do so too.”Keith Lewis said: “We would like the council to move quickly to develop supplementary planning guidance, like some other cities, to set a minimum and decent standard for co-living accommodation and would urge that no such accommodation is approved in the city until standards are adopted.”Harlequins shopping centre in context with Exeter city wall and Northernhay Street housingOne such example is the new London Plan, which includes a policy on co-living development which, despite not being formally adopted, nevertheless carries significant planning weight and constitutes a material consideration in planning decisions. If defines what it calls Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living and sets out minimum requirements for adequately functional living space and layout and, because it is not considered suitable as a form of affordable housing itself, requires developers to pay cash in lieu contributions towards conventional affordable housing provision off site.Manchester City Council also adopted policy on co-living earlier this year, which it introduced as a material planning consideration on an interim basis despite itself being in the middle of the development of a new local plan. It followed a comprehensive two stage consultation and was based on a report which included extensive comparative research into co-living development and policy elsewhere which sought to clarify the extent to which its own policy should be based on specific local considerations. Residents of St David’s submitted the report to Exeter City Council during the Harlequins consultation.The policy included several notable provisions, including that co-living schemes “must demonstrate that they command support from recently arrived or new employers” located nearby, with the size and scale of the developments “underpinned by the generation of employment opportunities from those employers” and a “robust justification demonstrating evidenced need” provided for each scheme which showed a “clear link between the need to recruit and retain staff” and the development.Co-living schemes in Manchester are also required to demonstrate how they comply with the city council’s adopted space standards. They must only accommodate “working households, or households actively seeking work” and prohibit “letting to students”, must impose maximum stays on short-term studio lets (the example given is six months), must charge affordable rents and include a “conversion plan to demonstrate how the building could be repurposed”. They cannot directly contribute to the delivery of affordable housing targets, so must indirectly do so via cash in lieu contributions.  “We would like the council to move quickly to develop supplementary planning guidance, like some other cities, to set a minimum and decent standard for co-living accommodation and would urge that no such accommodation is approved in the city until standards are adopted.”  Keith Lewis, Exeter Civic SocietyWe asked Exeter City Council why the planning officer’s report on the Harlequins application did not consider or refer to any other local authority policies or their supporting research, and were told, despite Manchester City Council having done so, that “it would not be appropriate to refer to a policy derived from another authority as the evidence base for their policy will not be the same as for Exeter.”Manchester City Council’s policy development research also warned that co-living has important implications for council tax, including collection risks due to short tenures and revenue risks from high proportions of low-banded cluster flats in such developments. The city’s resulting policy accordingly requires co-living operators to take responsibility for council tax collection risks and pay the council directly for each block.Exeter City Council’s planning officer mentioned council tax just once in his report, simply saying: “The co-living block will generate council tax”, but the management plan submitted with the application makes clear that individual tenants, and not the operator, would be responsible for payments. We asked Exeter City Council why the risks to council tax revenues in co-living developments were not identified and addressed in the officer’s report, but it declined to respond.Harlequins shopping centre in context with Paul Street and Guildhall car parkHad Exeter City Council adopted a formal co-living policy before its October planning committee meeting, even only as an interim measure as other local planning authorities have, its decision might have been different. At it was, the city council planning officer’s report recommended approval and the committee followed suit.Mary Chichester of Save Our Historic Exeter spoke at the meeting, identifying many of the material flaws in the application. She said: “The proposed seven storey tower block in the core of Exeter’s central conservation area will completely overshadow surrounding three and four storey listed buildings. It will also dwarf the Roman city wall, a national monument, the impact on which, astonishingly, the council heritage report says is a ‘slight negative’.“There is no such category as a ‘slight negative’ impact recognised in the NPPF. This report finds that the level of harm to most of the listed buildings in Northernhay Street and Square is ‘moderate to substantial adverse’. It is claimed that the public benefits of this scheme outweigh this level of harm but nowhere is this claim justified. Therefore, such a conclusion is not warranted.“Hundreds of Exeter residents have expressed strong objections and over 4000 people have signed the Save Our Historic Exeter petition. The Georgian Group, The Victorian Society, Exeter Civic Society and many local historians have concluded unanimously that the proposal will harm the city’s heritage assets. Even the council’s own heritage officer agrees that the proposal will cause harm to the many listed buildings on Northernhay Street and Queen Street, including RAMM.“His heritage report states repeatedly that there will be harm and impact, but then dismisses it as ‘less than substantial’ fourteen times. The cumulative impact on the conservation area must qualify as substantial harm.”  “It is claimed that the public benefits of this scheme outweigh this level of harm but nowhere is this claim justified.”  Mary Chichester, Save Our Historic ExeterWhen invited to ask questions about the content of Mary Chichester’s speech the members of the planning committee remained silent. In contrast, they asked more than a dozen questions of Chris Dadds, who was introduced as a public speaker despite being the developer’s agent. When asked whether the developer would safeguard damage to the city wall or any other nearby listed buildings, he said it would “ensure, as best anyone is able, that any damage is minimised, avoided and mitigated”. When asked about the likely length of co-living tenancies, he was unable to supply an answer, but did confirm that there would be no maximum lease length.Diana Moore, who is not a member of the planning committee, attended to speak on behalf of St David’s ward residents. She said: “The proposed design, scale and mass of the co-living tower block or hotel will not make a positive contribution to the local character of either conservation area and the excessive height and mass of both buildings will be overbearing on significant designated heritage assets, particularly to the areas facing the city wall.“This is an ideal site for new housing, however agreeing this plan for this site would open out similar sites for more ad hoc development that will further undermine housing supply. We know that Exeter has a real shortage of affordable housing. At 20% affordable ‘room’ (not housing), with none supplied at social rent levels and no offsite alternative provision, this proposal fails to go any way towards meeting those needs.”Luke Sills, a Labour councillor for St David’s who was unable to attend the meeting due to illness, asked Diana Moore to speak on his behalf. She said: “He has asked me to convey his concerns to the committee about the development which relate to massing, co-living and the impact on heritage”. Robert Lamb, another Labour councillor who represents St David’s, was not present at and did not contribute to the meeting.Historic City Gate Hotel and Iron Bridge from Northernhay StreetNone of the members of the planning committee represent St David’s ward, where the Harlequins redevelopment will have the greatest impact. However eight of the city council’s ten executive members do sit on the committee, giving the council’s Labour leadership a built-in near two-thirds majority on planning policy and development decisions affecting the city. No other planning authority in the south west peninsula follows this practice, where the highest proportion of executive members on other planning committees is only a third, and six local authorities have no executive members on their planning committees at all.Exeter City Council’s leader, Phil Bialyk and Labour councillor Emma Morse, who is Executive Portfolio Holder for City Development, also sit on the committee, which Emma Morse chairs, although doing so is contrary to national guidance from the Local Government Association Planning Advisory Service.Seven of the committee’s eight Executive members voted in favour of the plans, with Laura Wright voting against alongside Rob Hannaford, Michael Mitchell and Yolonda Henson.Gladstone Road co-living block comparative elevations. Image: Manson.Since approving the Harlequins development proposals, the city council’s planning committee has approved another co-living development, on the site of the Gladstone Road South Western Ambulance Service station. Watkins Jones PLC is also behind this development, which will see a six storey block that contains 133 co-living bedspaces loom over adjacent two storey terraces on Sandford Walk and elsewhere behind.The city council planning officer’s report followed the template set by the Harlequins decision, accepting economic impact claims at face value, requiring affordable housing provision in only 20% of the development, considering the plans as Build to Rent and sui generis at the same time, ignoring council tax revenue risks and accepting that the provision of just over three square metres of communal space per bed will compensate for studios that do not meet national minimum space standards. The Gladstone Road development was also originally presented as purpose built student accommodation.  “Co-living is an experimental concept that is gambling with people’s lives. It is an approach that seeks to maximise profits by squeezing as many people as possible into spaces that fail to meet national space standards. What this area of the city desperately needs is a mix of homes including affordable family homes.”  Jemima Moore, Exeter councillor96% of 134 public consultation responses to this development were objections, with only two in support. Reflecting the views of many objectors, Jemima Moore, independent councillor for the Newtown and St Leonard’s ward where the development will take place, said: “Co-living is an experimental concept that is gambling with people’s lives. It is an approach that seeks to maximise profits by squeezing as many people as possible into spaces that fail to meet national space standards. What this area of the city desperately needs is a mix of homes including affordable family homes.”Michael Mitchell added: “The design of these miniscule rooms reveals developers are just rebranding student accommodation in a way which enables developers to avoid paying developer levies. If they are genuinely intended for essential workers, they are an insult. Especially since there is no stipulation that even the smallest rooms are for single occupancy. Couples could find themselves trying to live in a room which is only eighteen feet square. These living spaces represent little more than hotel rooms, which might be fine for a few nights, but represent cramped living for the longer term and are unfit for a decent quality of life.”Gladstone Road co-living block rendered comparative elevations. Image: Manson.The Harlequins redevelopment proposals seek to present the block’s owners and managers as community stakeholders despite being transnational corporations, and co-living as community-oriented despite the developer’s agent saying it provides “no strings attached” accommodation “regardless of location”.They advocate co-living as a response to local housing need despite supplying no evidence of demand for this type of accommodation, as a remedy for rising housing costs despite it being anything but affordable and as not for student accommodation despite students being expected to live there. They present the bedspaces it provides as homes despite them neither meeting national minimum space standards nor supplying sufficient amenity or future flexibility to meet planning policy guidelines.They conflate supply with demand, and density with size. They contradict government definitions to claim that co-living units would contribute to the council’s housing supply targets, and rely on sui generis classification to minimise affordable housing provision requirements despite Build to Rent normally constituting residential development.Their economic impact claims don’t stand up to scrutiny, with the lion’s share of the spending generated by the development not benefiting the city, and they propose minor improvements to public realm in the immediate vicinity of the buildings as sufficient to offset significant harm to heritage assets that would be caused by the scheme.And Exeter City Council, which has chosen not to pass its own co-living policy despite the significant weight such a policy could have in planning decisions, agrees with the developers despite near-unanimous opposition from the community and conservation charities.As local resident Marsha Hunt said: “Exeter city centre is in real danger of becoming a large extended university campus and ignoring and excluding its permanent residents who have strong or long reaching ties to the city. After each tranche of students have left, the residents remain and it’s the residents who take care of the city, volunteer, create and bring up families, create communities and it’s those communities that are being ignored in favour of another huge global development company with no real ties to this city and purely profit at the heart of its motivation.”Liveable Exeter North Gate redevelopment vision (left) with North Street illustration (bottom right) and City Centre Vision for a Green Capital illustration (top right). Images: Exeter City Council.Nevertheless, the approval granted by the council’s Executive-led planning committee remains subject to a legal agreement which has yet to be completed and other conditions being met. This has allowed a coalition of local residents and campaigners, local conservation charities and community groups including Exeter Civic Society, Devon Archeological Society and Devon Buildings Group, backed by national conservation charities The Victorian Society and The Georgian Group, to appeal to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities &amp;amp; Local Government to call in the decision. If the Secretary of State agrees, an inspector will be appointed to carry out an inquiry, the results of which the Secretary of State will take into account when making what would be a final, binding decision.Since Exeter City Council approved the Harlequins redevelopment plans, the Secretary of State has stepped in to refuse permission for a co-living block in the centre of Norwich after a long campaign by local residents. If he does not overrule the current plans for the site, the rash of purpose built student accommodation that has erupted in Exeter in recent years looks set to be followed by a spate of functionally and aesthetically indistinguishable co-living developments which are likely to offer substandard short-term accommodation and do nothing to address Exeter’s affordable housing needs.When asked recently about the status of Exeter’s City Centre Vision for a Green Capital, on which the Liveable Exeter “Transformational Housing Delivery Programme” for the North Gate area of the city centre is based, Exeter City Council said the document “is a vision and not an action plan”. The lesson in the council’s approach to the proposed Harlequins redevelopment appears to be that neither of these documents are of any relevance when it comes to what actually happens on the ground.MHCLG has confirmed that the Secretary of State is now considering whether to call in the Harlequins decision.Anyone can write to the Secretary of State to request that a planning decision is called in and give their reasons for doing so. The Harlequins application reference and the relevant casework manager’s contact details are available here.A House of Commons library briefing explains the process in more detail, and a Planning Inspectorate guide offer further information. There is a an additional Planning Inspectorate guide for interested parties involved in an enquiry.UPDATE – 4 January 2021The Secretary of State confirmed today that the application will not be called in. The decision was made on his behalf by officials under delegated powers:“The Government remains committed to giving more power to councils and communities to make their own decisions on planning issues, and believe that planning decisions should be made at the local level wherever possible.“The call-in policy makes it clear that the power to call in a case will only be used very selectively.“The Secretary of State has decided, having had regard to this policy, not to call in this application.  He is satisfied that the application should be determined at a local level.”"

"content" : "The Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter NHS Foundation Trust is pushing ahead with plans to provide 205 new car parking spaces on trust-owned land near the main hospital site at Wonford.It is carrying out the development without obtaining permission from the local planning authority under powers introduced in April as part of the government’s emergency measures to combat the coronavirus.The new legislation gives health and local authorities conditional but wide-ranging powers to carry out development “for the purposes of preventing an emergency; reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency; and taking other action in connection with an emergency”.Some buildings on the site, opposite the Nuffield Hospital on Wonford Road, have already been demolished. Exeter City Council has confirmed its approval, as local planning authority, is not required.Demolition in progress at the new RD&amp;amp;E Hospital car parking siteThe new powers are only valid until the end of the year, although they may be extended while the pandemic continues.However the Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter NHS Foundation Trust has submitted a separate planning application to Exeter City Council seeking permission for the car parking to remain beyond then.Hospital management say the additional spaces will be needed until 2022, but the application does not give an end-date for use as a car park despite its description as a “temporary” facility.Public transport access to the hospitalIn policy and planning terms, the trust’s car parking proposal is contrary to what the city council and its partners, including the trust, are seeking to achieve.Cars generate carbon emissions, so reducing the number of private car journeys in the city is an important part of the response to climate change.By facilitating additional private car journeys, the trust is in practice saying that its short term operational needs trump the more important requirement to respond to the climate emergency.The trust’s proposal is inconsistent with:      Exeter City Council’s recently-updated corporate plan, which reaffirms the city’s commitment to being carbon neutral by 2030. The plan also says that “sustainable means of travel will be cheaper, quicker and more convenient than private car ownership” and continues “land currently dominated by driving and parking will be freed up for social, economic and environmental uses”.        Exeter City Futures’s Net Zero Exeter plan, which has been adopted by the city council and the Liveable Exeter Place Board. This sets out pathways to achieving the 2030 goal, and echoes the statements in the city’s corporate plan about reducing the dominance of the private car.        Exeter City Council’s Air Quality Action Plan, which emphasises the necessity of reducing emissions from motor vehicles for public health.        Exeter City Council’s Local Plan Core Strategy, which commits the city to ensuring “that no more car parking is provided to serve existing and new developments than is necessary” and  sets out specific measures to reduce private car use in the city.  Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter Hospital parking signThe trust’s planning application provides no specific evidence as to why these planning considerations should be set aside.The Design &amp;amp; Access Statement accompanying its application says the new car park is “deemed essential to allow the hospital to operate, albeit at reduced capacity, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic” and that “additional staff parking facilities are required as a result of increased reliance on private transport in the absence of any viable and safe alternative means”.The statement also claims that “current and expected long-term social distancing restrictions on public transport and car sharing schemes have seen a drastic reduction in functionality within the hospital with disruption to patient services and care treatment”.No specific examples of disruption are provided, which makes it difficult for local authority planning officers deciding the application to balance short-term need against longer-term disbenefits.Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter Hospital main visitor car parkThe Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter NHS Foundation Trust’s chief executive is a member of the Liveable Exeter Place Board which is overseeing implementation of the Net Zero Exeter plan, and its chief financial officer sits on the board of Exeter City Futures.The Trust’s website says it shares “the commitment to making Exeter a carbon neutral city by 2030” and says it is “committed to supporting alternative travel methods” in its Sustainable Development Management Plan, which says it is preparing a Green Travel Management Plan.We asked the trust to provide clear evidence of the disruption it claims is being caused by the lack of 205 car parking spaces and what progress it has made on its travel management plan.The trust sent us the following statement in reply:“Maintaining public safety through the coronavirus pandemic has meant public transport and other travel options such as car sharing and our Park &amp;amp; Ride remain significantly restricted. This has resulted in greater demand for car parking at the hospital.“To ensure that patient parking can be prioritised, the Trust has obtained temporary planning permission to convert some unused RD&amp;amp;E buildings off Wonford Road into a NHS keyworker car park.“Whilst the Trust is absolutely committed to moving towards more sustainable ways of working and achieving Exeter’s aim of being carbon neutral by 2030, we have had to be pragmatic about the impact of COVID-19 on travel.

"content" : "The number of executive members on Exeter City Council’s planning committee has more than doubled since April 2016 to give the executive a built-in near two-thirds majority on planning policy and development decisions affecting the city.No other planning authority in the south west peninsula follows this practice, where the highest proportion of executive members on other planning committees is only one third, and six local authorities have no executive members on their planning committees at all.The Exeter City Council leader and the portfolio holder for city planning and development also sit on the committee, although doing so is contrary to national guidance from the Local Government Association Planning Advisory Service.St Sidwell’s Point development site after demolitionIt is a fundamental principle of the planning system in England that those who decide applications for development - whether for a garage extension or a major shopping centre - do so in accordance with planning law, national and local planning policies and the ethical standards expected of public office holders.Most applications are decided by councillors or officers in local planning authorities, of which Exeter City Council is one.The Planning Advisory Service, part of the Local Government Association and funded by central government, has been issuing guidance since 1992 on the legal and ethical considerations to be borne in mind by councillors when determining planning applications.The latest edition, issued in December 2019, aims to ensure that “decisions on plan making and planning applications are undertaken, on behalf of communities, in a fair, impartial and transparent way”.St Sidwell’s Point development under constructionThe Planning Advisory Service guidance says planning committee members “need to avoid any appearance of bias or having ‘predetermined’ views when making a decision on a planning application or policy”.Predetermination involves a councillor entering a decision-making meeting with a closed mind either in favour of or against a specific planning application.The guidance is unequivocal: “Avoiding predetermination and the impression of it is essential. The decision making process must be seen to be fair and impartial from the perspective of an external observer.“If a decision maker has predetermined their position, they should withdraw from being a member of the decision making body for that matter.”Planning decisions suspected of predetermination may be vulnerable to challenge by judicial review.Bampfylde Street student accommodation blocksThe Planning Advisory Service guidance also focusses on ‘predisposition’, where a planning committee member “may have a pre-existing opinion or attitude about the matter under discussion, but remains open to listening to all the arguments and changing their mind in light of the information presented at the meeting”.It contains specific advice on the composition of planning committees intended to minimise the risks of predetermination, predisposition and other conflicts of interest:“Local planning authorities will usually have a cabinet or executive member responsible for development and planning (sometimes known as the portfolio holder).“Planning Advisory Service advise[s] that the leader and portfolio holder of a local authority, who play an important role driving planning policies and proposals, should normally exclude themselves from decision making committees.”In Exeter, not only are the council leader and planning portfolio holder members of the planning committee, so are six other members of the executive.With a total committee membership of thirteen, this arrangement gives the executive a built-in majority on planning decisions.Mary Arches Street construction siteThis has not happened by accident. In the month before the May 2016 council elections only three members of the executive sat on the planning committee. By June the committee had five executive members.This was increased to six the following year and by June this year the number was seven, giving the executive its majority. The eighth was added in August, replacing committee chair Councillor Rachel Lyons who is not a member of the executive.Last month Exeter Observer surveyed all other local planning authorities in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset. Six had no executive members on their planning committees at all, including Cornwall Council, Torbay Council and Plymouth City Council.Of the rest, the proportion of executive members on the planning committee ranged from 8% to 33%. The proportion in Exeter is 62%.We asked the city council’s press office for a statement explaining why the council was so out of line with its peers. After five weeks and with apologies for the delay, a press officer said:“It is a matter for the leaders of the various political groups represented on the council to identify members of their groups for membership of all committees, including the planning committee, in accordance with the statutory requirement for political proportionality.“The leader of the council therefore identified the relevant number of members from his group to sit on the planning committee.”However this did not answer the question we asked, since political proportionality - the balance of councillors by party on the full council - is not at issue: Labour are entitled to ten of the thirteen planning committee seats.In view of this we asked the council to reconsider its statement, but a spokesperson said there was nothing to add.Pinhoe construction siteWe then asked council leader Phil Bialyk to comment. He responded with admirable alacrity, saying he was not sure what our concern was and stressing that members were appointed to the planning committee in line with the political proportionality rules.We tried again with Councillor Bialyk, explaining that the number of Labour members on the committee was not at issue, and that what we were seeking was an explanation for the high number of members of the council’s executive on the planning committee.We asked for an explanation of the council’s divergence from national guidance and the practice of neighbouring councils, and how he would answer the charge that Exeter City Council under his leadership “has stacked the membership of the planning committee to ensure that applications backed by the executive will inevitably be approved”.He replied by saying he had nothing to add to his previous response.Monkerton construction siteThis is not an academic debate. Exeter City Council has embarked on a programme of major projects overseen by the unelected and unaccountable Liveable Exeter Place Board.These include the construction of 12,000 new homes, the reconfiguration of the city in pursuit of carbon neutrality and the development of new sports and leisure facilities and transport infrastructure.Much of this will involve the city council and its partners submitting applications for development, change of use of existing buildings and land and other matters controlled by the planning system.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            The council’s own code of conduct for local planning (part 5i of the council’s constitution) says: “Applications submitted by the city council and members or officers employed by the city council can give rise to a suspicion of impropriety by the public.“This relates to both planning applications and development plan proposals.“It is essential that they are handled in a way that gives no grounds for preferential treatment.”The inclusion of the council leader and the city planning and development portfolio holder on the planning committee and the executive committee’s built-in majority on that committee create unnecessary risk by increasing opportunities to challenge planning decisions on procedural grounds.Like cuts to council decision-making scrutiny, outsourcing carbon reduction policy to Exeter City Futures and allowing Liveable Exeter Place Board to decide parts of the city’s corporate plan, they also say more about the council’s intention to promote its agenda than its stated aspiration to be “a model of strong local democracy”."

"content" : "Devon County Council has abandoned its plans for temporary COVID-19 cycling and walking safety measures in Exeter city centre despite widespread support for the changes from survey respondents and consultees.The proposed changes were to be funded under the first phase of a £250 million coronavirus emergency active travel fund announced by the Secretary of State for Transport on 9 May.The county council has repeatedly said it would provide “improved foot and cycle access to the city centre via South Street, Fore Street and North Street, including widening of footways with temporary barriers on key pedestrian and public transport route to the city centre, including additional space around busy Cowick Street bus stops.”Andrew Leadbetter, Devon County Council cabinet liaison for Exeter, initially confirmed the changes would take place by 1 June but work only started elsewhere in Exeter the following week.Stuart Hughes, Devon County Council cabinet member for highways management, then said the county would be “moving on to additional changes to the city centre” and subsequently confirmed that “further changes” would be introduced “over the next few weeks as the roll-out of this programme continues”.And Exeter’s Highways and Traffic Orders Committee was told as recently as 22 July that the schemes on Fore Street and South Street were “in progress” while the scheme on Cowick Street was under “discussion”.However the county council has since said that the first tranche of funding has been spent on measures which have already been installed, while information about the North Street, Fore Street and Cowick Street proposals has been removed from its website and no further details have been provided for the South Street scheme.Pedestrians on Exeter Fore Street with limited social distancing spaceIn addition, Department for Transport guidance specified that any “pop-up” cycling facilities installed under the scheme should have a “minimum level of physical separation from volume traffic” and should use “light segregation features such as flexible plastic wands” and “be segregated as far as possible, i.e. with physical measures separating cyclists and other traffic.”It continued: “Lanes indicated by road markings only are very unlikely to be sufficient to deliver the level of change needed, especially in the longer term”.However the changes introduced on Magdalen Road do not physically separate cyclists from traffic, rely on road markings only, and compel cyclists to ride closer to oncoming vehicles than before.The county council said that the car parking on Magdalen Road was “considered essential by traders”, so in order to provide a “safe amount of room for vehicles to manoeuvre in and out of the spaces” a cycle lane with “lined segregation” was implemented. As a consequence, the cycle lane is obstructed when drivers swing across it in order to park.The county council also said the guidance did not say that cycle lanes must be segregated.A man crosses Exeter South Street between moving and parked carsAt the end of May Exeter City Futures convened a wide range of stakeholders including county councillors, city councillors, Exeter’s chief executive and MP and others for an “Emergency Transport &amp;amp; Travel Roundtable” which discussed transport proposals for the city.A subsequent report which described participants as a “balanced mix of representation” recorded their recommendations for a series of “top priorities for action” which included closing arterial routes, significantly improving cycle routes, trialling a congestion charge, pedestrianising the city centre and reallocating road space for buses and cyclists.And in June Exeter Cycling Campaign conducted a community survey which received responses from more than 900 people in just ten days, 90% of whom were car owners.96% of respondents were in favour of low traffic neighbourhoods, 95% said they would feel safer cycling in the city if separate bike paths were built, 69% wanted less motor traffic on residential streets and 55% supported the introduction of lower speed limits.A cyclist, buses and pedestrians on Exeter Fore StreetHowever a presentation by the county council’s Head of Planning, Transportation and Environment to Exeter’s Highways and Traffic Orders Committee on 22 July said that, alongside public support and a majority in favour, there was “pushback” from traders who were “typically less receptive to changes”.It was told that the North Street scheme that the county had proposed, which would have included a contraflow leading to the signalised junction of North Street, Paul Street and St David’s Hill, was “too complex”, although South Street, Fore Street and Cowick Street also include signalised junctions.The committee was also told that further liaison was still to take place with traders on Fore Street and South Street and discussion with local members on Cowick Street.The committee members then agreed to delegate further decisions concerning any new “pop-up” schemes, and further changes to existing schemes, to the county council Head of Planning, Transportation and Environment in consultation with the committee chair and local member.It also agreed to keep existing temporary walking and cycling measures until 13 October this year, when they will be reviewed following consultation. The government guidance allows them to stay in place for up to eighteen months.The committee also heard that the county plans to spend £318,203 of the second round of funding on three permanent changes in Exeter, none of which are in the city centre.Detailed reports to the committee examined these three changes, which are listed in the Exeter schemes the county council has included in its bid for second round funding, due for submission on 7 August.The bid also mentions “South Street and Fore Street cycle improvements”, but provides no further details.Topsham Fore Street temporary pedestrianised zone proposals. Source: Exeter City Council.The July meeting of Exeter’s Highways and Traffic Orders Committee was also told that proposals for similar coronavirus emergency measures in Topsham which would have temporarily turned its Fore Street into a pedestrianised zone had been discussed but were not part of the government scheme.A seven day public consultation concerning these proposals, which were promoted by Exeter City Council as part of a government initiative to re-open High Streets, was held in the form of an online “snap poll”. This then informed a decision not to proceed with the changes. The results of the poll were removed after it concluded, and are no longer available in the public domain.The “Topsham Councillor Team” Facebook page, which is published on behalf of the city council’s three Topsham ward councillors, Andrew Leadbetter (who is both a city and county councillor), Rob Newby and Keith Sparkes featured this post on the day the poll opened:“Exeter City Council are likely to shut Fore Street in Topsham to traffic as part of their Covid 19 response. You may have seen other restrictions in other parts of the city that are contributing to traffic congestion such as making Magdalen Road, one way.“These measures are causing hardship to local businesses and are widely opposed. The Topsham Ward Councillors are concerned, having already talked to traders and local residents.“We are aware that before Covid 19 shops in Topsham saw a dramatic drop in trade due to street works that stopped cars using the short term free parking. This latest experiment could last for 18 months. The closure does not have the support of Devon County Council, or local traders.“We would urge you to voice your objection directly to Exeter City Council by filling in their 1 minute survey that can be found at [broken link] and also ask that you complete our quick straw poll that can be found on our facebook page.”Pedestrians on Topsham Fore Street.

The road closure could impact dramatically on local shops and could last for up to 18 months.“Is this a good idea when shops are struggling to survive following Covid 19?”A protest was then held on 29 June, the day before the “snap poll” closed, organised by traders and residents “to stop Topsham ‘being turned into a ghost town’”.It appears Devon County Council did not engage in pubic consultation on the issue, despite its officers collaborating with Exeter City Council officers on the proposals, and it remains unclear who took the decision to drop the proposals.A county council spokesperson said: “Not all of the proposed changes in Exeter have been realised, partly due to the limited funding available, while some changes have also been made as a result of consultation, and as lockdown has eased across the country.“We have listened to feedback and amended proposals accordingly. This reflects the statutory guidance, which states that, ‘local businesses, including those temporarily closed, should be consulted to ensure proposals meet their needs when they re-open’”.

However, the guidance also says it does not replace the 2004 Network Management Duty Guidance, which states that the local transport authority: “should seek the views of residents, local businesses and the different road users both when deciding which policies on network management to adopt and when monitoring whether these policies are delivering the required outcomes.”It goes on to say: “When developing strategies and processes for improving the operation of the road network, local transport authorities should consult with the public, frontagers, representatives of road users and neighbouring authorities with an interest.“Focus groups of representative street users and facilitated meetings with representatives of street users and adjoining authorities are other useful means of consultation.“One of the findings from several consultation exercises carried out by local transport authorities is that the public have little idea of who is responsible for the management of the road network in their area and would welcome a well publicised method of contacting someone responsible.”The day after the decision to drop the Topsham scheme was announced, the county council cabinet approved a £27 million increase on highways spending this year, making the “largest ever annual investment in Devon’s road network”.It has since announced that the junction of North Street and South Street in Exeter city centre will be closed next week, not for the installation of temporary emergency active travel infrastructure, but to resurface the carriageway.Devon County Council initially failed to respond to a request for comment on the issues raised in this article.It subsequently responded after the article was published, which has been amended to reflect answers to some of the questions asked.In its response Devon County Council also said: “The first tranche of Active Travel measures has to be introduced within eight weeks of receiving the funding, which takes us up to the end of August”.As this contradicted the Department for Transport guidance (reproduced on the county council’s website that work on reallocation of road space under the first phase of the scheme should be completed within eight weeks of starting (so by 31 July), the Department for Transport has been approached for clarification.UPDATE – 6pm 5 August 2020The Department for Transport has now responded and confirmed that it subsequently agreed that the eight week delivery period would begin on 6 July, when funding was disbursed, so the county council is correct to say that the deadline for delivery of the first tranche of active travel measures is 31 August.The article has been amended accordingly.However, as the county council has also said that the first tranche of funding has been spent on measures which have already been installed, and has not responded to a request for clarification of the status of the temporary Exeter city centre changes, the available information continues to support the conclusion that none of the proposed first phase city centre schemes will now be delivered.The county council was also asked, and failed to respond to, the following questions:  Why was a less complex North Street scheme that would have facilitated delivery not proposed?  How has informal consultation with non-trader stakeholders been incorporated into decision-making about changes in Exeter city centre under this scheme?  How were the Topsham proposals to be funded?  Did the proposed Topsham Fore Street closure have the support of Devon County Council?  Did Devon County Council engage in public consultation concerning the Topsham proposals?  On what basis was the decision not to proceed with the Topsham proposals taken?  Does this approach to public consultation meet the standards for good governance contained in Devon County Council’s Annual Governance Statement?It was also asked for a simple summary breakdown indicating where the £150,000 tranche one emergency active travel scheme funding allocated to Exeter has been spent, including the amount spent in each location, but did not supply this information."

"content" : "The Committee on Climate Change published its annual report on 25 June, two days before the anniversary of the UK’s carbon reduction pledge being signed into law. The report rebuked the government’s slow progress, urging much more dramatic action to avoid a post-pandemic emissions rebound.The government nevertheless announced spending plans a few days later that dismayed environmental experts after spending billions of pounds during lockdown bailing out airlines, carmakers and oil companies without attaching emissions reduction conditions.Other G20 countries have taken similar post-pandemic public investment decisions despite being committed to the Paris Agreement on climate change.The report followed news that “incredibly alarming” research being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, due next year, suggests that previous worse-case global heating scenarios may not go far enough.At the same time Siberian heatwaves have seen temperatures of 38°C inside the Arctic circle, with some places doubling previous records, and a major study has confirmed that the dramatic drop in emissions caused by coronavirus lockdowns around the world, even if sustained permanently, would be nowhere near enough to limit global heating to 1.5°C by 2050.Leading climate experts say that policy-makers and their advisers are “running scared” of the fundamental changes that are urgently needed to prevent catastrophic impacts, choosing politically-palatable policies to present as solutions that don’t actually work.Typology of climate delay discourses. Source: Discourses of climate delay under CC BY 4.0 license.Despite Exeter City Council’s “mission to be recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation” it is clear that it does not have all the answers to these problems. Neither do Exeter’s youth climate activists: none of us can tackle this crisis alone.But it is also clear that, despite expressing support for carbon neutrality when first confronted by Exeter’s youth climate strikers in February 2019, and declaring their intent to make the city carbon neutral by 2030 the following month, city councillors had very limited understanding of what reducing Exeter’s carbon footprint to sustainable levels would actually involve.The Exeter City Futures “Net Zero” Exeter plan subsequently commissioned by the council acknowledges that it also has limitations, and that it is incomplete work in progress that requires further input and development before an update at the end of the year.However it actually has profound flaws that cannot be addressed by minor changes.These include ignoring major sources of emissions altogether, an unexamined reliance on unworkable and unjust carbon offsetting, and a mismatch between what is expected of the private sector and what the private sector is capable of delivering.The consultation on the plan’s content was little more than performative, and it leaves monitoring mechanisms unexplained, relies heavily on voluntary behaviour change and ignores unavoidable systemic transformation in favour of partial, technocratic solutionism.Since the plan was published, its failure to explore approaches to change that do not rely on massive inward capital investment has become even more acute as financial shortfalls caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted Exeter City Council’s chief executive to describe plan delivery as “problematic”.The city council’s Executive has nevertheless already accepted it and Exeter’s full council meets today to confirm that decision.Exeter youth climate strikers. Photo: Anders Eidesvik.We recognise that the plan contains policies which would not be out of place alongside a Green New Deal for Devon, such as a local retraining scheme for workers in high-carbon sectors. But we remain extremely concerned about how such proposals will be implemented, and by whom.We offer these criticisms to challenge Exeter to confront the transformation that is necessary for a just transition to a low carbon economy. Analysing and challenging political decisions in the public sphere is necessary for any democracy to function. We should always be open to criticism, and support, from each other.Exeter youth climate strikersFirst, some definitions. Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, are emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, the clearance of land and the production and consumption of food, goods, materials, buildings, roads and other products and services.The carbon footprint of a defined population, system or activity is its total greenhouse gas emissions considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage, expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). When products and services are imported, the emissions from their supply chains are imported with them.Carbon offsetting involves compensating for emissions in one place by reducing them in another, often where it is cheaper to do so.The idea is that industries in developed countries which employ the most efficient technologies, but nevertheless still emit greenhouse gases, invest to make projects in developing countries cleaner than they would otherwise be. (In practice this is often not what happens, as we shall explore in the next article in the series.)Carbon offsetting comes in two main forms: voluntary, where it is often bought by consumers to alleviate guilt or businesses to promote their brands, or via compliance mechanisms imposed on companies or countries by governments or transnational organisations like the European Union.As even basic human needs such as food, warmth and shelter are difficult to achieve without carbon emissions in industrialised societies in which many people have very high expectations about living standards, cities such as Exeter cannot avoid offsetting if they want to stop contributing to the climate crisis.A net zero carbon population, system or activity entails that population, system or activity removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere itself in order to counteract its carbon emissions, which is very difficult to achieve for Exeter because of its limited land supply and the sources of its emissions.In contrast carbon neutrality typically involves the purchase of offsets to counteract emissions instead of drawing down carbon directly.Carbon footprint of global food supply chain. Source: Visual Capitalist.However the Office of National Statistics and Committee on Climate Change both use “net zero” to describe a combination of the two, in a fudge that routinely produces confusion, as it did when Exeter City Council’s Executive committee decided to commission Exeter City Futures to oversee production of what is now called the “Net Zero” Exeter plan in June last year.The council nevertheless directed Exeter City Futures to adopt more meaningful language by replacing terms such as “net zero” with “carbon neutral” from then on, a decision that was reviewed both in a subsequent scrutiny meeting and another Executive meeting before being ratified by the full council in July.But six months later “Net Zero” reappeared in an Exeter City Futures progress update as the name of a proposed “mobilisation summit” (which did not take place because of the coronavirus pandemic) and has been in use ever since.It framed the “blueprint” that was published in February and the political and business consultation workshops and public engagement exercise that took place in February and March. It also defined the resulting “Net Zero” Exeter carbon reduction plan which was delivered to the council in April and is about to become council policy.The plan isn’t just named this way: “net zero” appears 106 times in the body of the document and a further 65 times in page number subheadings. This is nearly five times as many appearances as “carbon neutral”.None of the city councillors or officers who attended the scrutiny committee which heard the update had anything to say about the reversal of the council’s earlier policy decision, and the full council members who met in February ratified the scrutiny committee’s minutes without comment.According to the council, Exeter City Futures made this decision independently.Exeter City Council Strategic Scrutiny committee in actionThe distinction between “net zero” and “carbon neutral” may not seem significant in the scheme of things. But the language we use to describe and think about our world has profound consequences, particularly in the public sphere, while its ambiguities can, and often are, exploited by bad actors.For example, so called “zero emissions” cars are actually only so at the exhaust pipe (as is acknowledged in their promotional small print), and continue to produce significant levels of particulate pollution when driven, as well as having very high production impacts. Even when charged with renewable electricity such vehicles are neither zero carbon nor carbon neutral.Exeter’s first development of “zero carbon homes” at Pulling Road in Pinhoe is similarly misnamed. The UK Green Building Council says that the production and construction of residential buildings accounts for more than half their carbon emissions but no offsets are included in the developer’s plans, and the council has approved 96 car parking spaces for just 40 homes, a ratio of 2.4 cars per household.The council planning officer’s report ignored these issues, despite the council requiring all reports since July 2019 to “include an analysis of the progress and impact in working towards a carbon neutral city goal”. According to the council, this does not extend to quantified carbon impact assessments.The Passivhaus energy efficiency standard the city council has adopted for its flagship St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre development similarly ignores the carbon footprint of construction and the materials that are used, which is how the building’s design can rely on the enormous concrete pillars now rising above the site.Concrete is the most destructive material on earth: if the cement industry were a country it would be the world’s third largest carbon dioxide emitter after the US and China.Concrete foundations at St Sidwell’s Point construction siteThe city council last year proudly announced that 150 lorry loads of concrete were to be used in the first phase of building alone and that the site crane needed a concrete base deeper than a three storey building.The council, acting as planning authority, twice concluded no environmental impact assessment of the development was required, and at no point during the controversial scheme’s history has any form of carbon emissions modelling for the building’s life cycle been performed.The developers extol the half a million city centre visits the building is expected to drive each year, many of which will presumably be encouraged by the free car parking that is proposed, and promote its resilience in the face of predicted climate change.But no consideration been given to whether, like HS2, it could actually be a net carbon emitter over its lifespan because of the impact of its construction and use.Misleading marketing that promotes the consumption of goods and services which are part of the problem as if they are part of the solution is not new. But the terms in which Exeter frames its carbon reduction aspirations and resulting public policy do matter.The city council specifically instructed Exeter City Futures to use “carbon neutral” instead of “net zero” with this in mind. But a “Net Zero” Exeter plan has nevertheless been delivered and is about to become official council policy.Unfortunately, however, the council’s failure to follow up its own decisions runs deeper than the presentation of its carbon reduction plan. Its value as a policy on which meaningful decisions can be based is in doubt because, among other failings, it enormously understates the scale of the challenge the city faces.St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre promotional graphicAt its meeting in June last year, the city council Executive commissioned Exeter City Futures to conduct a full audit of the city’s current carbon emissions to identify what it called its “baseline state” as well as to “highlight gaps between current plans and what is required to achieve zero carbon”.This baseline audit was a key component of the city’s response to the climate emergency: the decision to commission it was discussed and approved at no fewer than four city council meetings.But the audit was never delivered, and there are major discrepancies between the carbon reduction figures that are included in the “Net Zero” Exeter plan and those contained in an Exeter City Futures progress update submitted to the council in December 2019 (and the “key facts” document it published in February 2020) which came from a University of Exeter study of Devon’s 2017 emissions.While the plan acknowledges that “a more comprehensive assessment of the carbon cost will need to be undertaken”, the total of all projected carbon savings from the actions it proposes (329,000tCO2e) is only 60% of the University of Exeter figure for the city (546,000tCO2e). This leaves more than 217,000tCO2e unaccounted for each year.Nor does the plan identify the relationship between the savings figures it presents and Exeter’s current carbon emissions. Instead it outlines a series of actions that “Exeter City Futures believe[s] can deliver the city’s carbon ambition” with carbon savings figures attached which it says have been calculated “for the forecast year 2031”.These savings are presented without reference to the emissions they are supposed to offset. Nearly 90,000tCO2e of energy emissions identified in the University of Exeter study are left out of the plan, and the impact of industrial activity in the city is ignored altogether.The lack of alignment between the plan’s proposed actions and established emissions monitoring datasets is reflected in the plan’s presentation: almost all its proposed actions are framed in terms of vaguely-defined activities, rather than specific outcomes, and very few include quantifiable measures of success.Sources: Exeter City Futures, University of Exeter.It is possible that the plan’s authors have assumed that Exeter’s carbon reduction goals need not match its current emissions levels, and that the city’s emissions will fall in tandem with national projections for the next ten years while wider changes add to those made in Exeter. (Although such assumptions are nowhere mentioned in the plan or its accompanying explanatory spreadsheet.)Provisional ONS statistics do suggest that the UK’s emissions fell 3.6% in 2019. But the country will nevertheless not meet its fourth carbon budget by 2023 nor its fifth by 2028. And these budgets were set against the previous target of an 80% net reduction in emissions by 2050: the new UK target of 100% net reduction by 2050 means change must accelerate across the country.Yet most Committee on Climate Change recommendations have not been delivered and the government is ploughing ahead with massive infrastructure spending, including £27 billion to build 4000 miles of new roads in the next five years despite road transport accounting for 91% of the UK’s domestic transport emissions.Road transport emissions continue to rise because of new road building, increased levels of driving and new cars producing more carbon emissions than older models. 4000 miles of new roads will wipe out 80% of the savings expected from switching to electric vehicles.At the same time COVID-19 lockdown carbon savings are evaporating fast with a winter second wave expected to prompt much higher residential emissions than forecast.Exeter youth climate strikers. Photo: Vanessa Miles.Exeter can hardly rely on poor UK performance against a 2050 target to meet its own 2030 target. And recently-published government data shows that Exeter’s emissions reductions performance lagged behind both Devon and the UK in 2018, the last year for which government local authority figures are available, when the county reduced its emissions by 2.76% and the country by 1.85%.Exeter’s emissions that year remained unchanged, with the city’s road transport emissions actually increasing over the previous decade.With both planned and pandemic-driven central government spending in conflict with its carbon reduction goals, the “Liveable Exeter” development plan, which would add 28,800 cars to the city’s roads at Pulling Road development rates, looks set to reflect national policy failures if its delivery continues in line with recent city planning decisions.When the council first brought forward the “Liveable Exeter” plan, it proposed a single “low traffic or car-free development” at Water Lane, which represents just 13% of the planned development. When MHCLG granted funding to support the scheme the council said “the focus is on supporting aspirations for active travel reducing the need to travel by car” (our emphasis throughout).No further details about the scheme’s plans to curtail private car ownership or use, which has now been “adopted” by the unelected Liveable Exeter Place Board (which meets in private and does not publish its discussions or decisions) have been made available.Spatial development at this scale which ignores its own impact combined with Devon County Council’s failure to deliver overdue transport plans may mean that Exeter’s emissions, at best, flatline at current levels for the next decade.Source: BEIS.However the “Net Zero” Exeter plan’s carbon reduction figures not only fail to account for the 217,000tCO2e of additional Exeter emissions identified by the University of Exeter study. The plan ignores several other major sources of emissions altogether.It does not mention the impact of Exeter Airport, reflecting a wider UK problem with carbon accounting which currently excludes international aviation from emissions reduction targets despite government estimates that it produced 45 million tonnes of CO2e in 2018.This is equivalent to 10% of the UK’s terrestrial emissions, a proportion that is projected to increase dramatically as many airports aim at doubling passenger numbers in the next ten years.Aviation emissions are similarly excluded from the University of Exeter study, but Civil Aviation Authority flight data suggests that Exeter Airport emitted more than 100,000tCO2e in 2019 excluding the significant number of private flights that take off and land there.This impact is consistent with another University of Exeter study which estimated Exeter Airport’s 2016 emissions as around 9% of Devon’s transport emissions (in line with national figures). This indicates that Exeter airport’s total emissions from all flights were more than 200,000tCO2e in 2019 and rising.UK aviation sector expansion by 2050. Source: Department for Transport.Nor does the plan address the consumption habits of Exeter’s residents. The ONS estimated the UK’s total carbon footprint at 784 million tCO2e in 2016, 60% of which was related to UK territorial consumption with the rest the result of imported aviation and supply chain emissions.A DEFRA study found the proportion was 53% a year later, although only showed a reduction of 2% on the previous year.This is consistent with other studies that show total UK footprint emissions falling more slowly than domestic emissions because increasing UK energy efficiency is not matched by similar technological changes in supply chain countries.Adjusting for the fall in UK domestic emissions between 2016 and 2019, the UK’s total carbon footprint is still likely to be around 725 million tCO2e, or just under 11tCO2e per capita.Exeter’s current residential population of just over 130,000 therefore suggests that a conservative estimate of the city’s true carbon footprint, including imported emissions from domestic and international aviation and consumption supply chains is likely to be in excess of 1,400,000tCO2e each year, of which at least half a million tonnes come from non-UK supply chains.The city’s relative affluence means its imported emissions are likely to be larger still.Source: ONS.None of these emissions are included in the “Net Zero” Exeter plan apart from a vague and unmeasurable recommendation that organisations use purchasing decisions to “encourage their supply chain to become carbon neutral”.This action, which is costed as free, is expected to save just 2,000tCO2e per annum. It is further explained in the spreadsheet which accompanies the plan, but this only refers to Exeter City Council’s own supply chain impact, which is estimated to be somewhere between around 2,000tCO2e and 9,000tCO2e per annum, based on widely varying figures from London boroughs, with the lowest of these figures deemed to represent best practice.If the council itself does not understand the impact of its own supply chains, or indeed the impact of its flagship St Sidwell’s Point leisure centre development, capturing the whole city’s carbon footprint at the level of detail that is needed for insightful decision-making (the “analytical approach” that is one of the plan’s twelve basic goals) looks likely to be beyond its reach.Nevertheless, Exeter’s imported emissions must be factored in to the city’s approach to achieving its carbon neutral target as they represent such a large proportion of the city’s carbon footprint.And while government policy has been to exclude imported emissions from its carbon accounting thus far, the recent first meeting of the Department for Transport’s new “net zero” board has suggested that they will be included in UK carbon reduction targets after 2023.By not delivering a baseline audit and so not including a comprehensive estimate of Exeter’s carbon footprint in the “Net Zero” Exeter plan, Exeter City Futures has failed to account for around 1.1 million tonnes of CO2e emissions imported by the city.This means that all the carbon savings from the actions it proposes put together equal less than a quarter of the city’s total emissions, which are likely to be in excess of 1,400,000tCO2e each year and could be higher still.Sources: Exeter City Futures, University of Exeter, DEFRA.There are many reasons why these failings are important, not the least of which is that the “Net Zero” Exeter plan assumes the city will pay to offset all the emissions it does not remove from its carbon footprint.At current carbon offset prices, which are capped in the UK at £18 per tonne per annum until 2021, the 217,000tCO2e of greenhouse gas emissions identified in the University of Exeter study that the plan does not account for would cost £3.6 million a year to offset every year from 2030 onwards.Offsetting the city’s true carbon footprint at these prices would cost closer to £20 million a year.And offsetting costs will rise significantly as 2030 approaches and other wealthy, industrialised countries arriving at their policy deadlines for carbon neutrality compete for necessarily limited carbon sink supplies.Nicholas Stern of the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute said in 2017 that “in order to stay within the two degree target, carbon prices need to reach between US$50-100 over the next 15 years.”As the “Net Zero” Exeter plan acknowledges, carbon prices that reflect the true cost of offsetting are closer to £95/tCO2e, which would mean the city would have to pay more than £100 million a year to offset its carbon footprint even if all the actions the plan proposes were carried out in full. The city clearly cannot pay this bill.Source: ONS.The current plan only makes a single mention of who might pay these costs. It proposes a carbon offset fund into which developers could be required to pay for the carbon emissions of all new homes built to “provide a source of grant funding for city carbon reduction projects”.This approach has been taken in Southwark and Milton Keynes among other places, and indeed Exeter City Council decided to adopt an updated Sustainable Development Supplementary Planning Document in December last year which could be used to implement such a scheme.But it is only intended to address energy efficiency, and there has been no indication that the council intends to use it to address the impact of construction and building materials, or increased car use or other consumption impacts that result from new development.And the scale of Exeter’s offsetting requirements resulting from the current plan’s proposals mean that the council would have to extract very large sums from developers.These payments would be so onerous that the “Liveable Exeter” development plan, another council flagship policy, could prove undeliverable. No consideration of this issue is included in the current plan. At the same time, as the plan notes, the government’s proposed Future Homes Standard may in any case prohibit this approach.In fact the only way to avoid enormous offsetting costs from 2030 onwards, while upholding its carbon reduction commitments, is for the city to reduce its carbon footprint much more comprehensively than the current “Net Zero” Exeter plan proposes.But without understanding the true scale of its impact, domestically and internationally, the city cannot begin to grasp the scale of the change that is necessary to reduce its offsetting liabilities to the point it can afford to meet its carbon reduction goals.Sources: Exeter City Futures, University of Exeter, DEFRA, WEF, Centre for Sustainable EnergyExeter City Futures did initially propose to assemble an academic team with the requisite specialist expertise to establish a “robust definition of what is included in the measurement of Exeter’s carbon emissions” as well as “how this accounts for the carbon emissions created in the wider region by commuters”.This was to be accompanied by a measurement framework, which would have greatly helped to clarify what is undoubtedly a complex situation and thus enable much more effective policy-making.Exeter City Futures later acknowledged, in its December 2019 progress report, that it did not have the “resource capacity” to deliver the baseline audit or “highlight gaps between current plans and what is required to achieve a carbon neutral city”.But the scrutiny committee which heard the progress report (the same meeting that did not comment on the replacement of “carbon neutral” with “net zero”) did not comment on this failure either.And, according to the council, it did not need to take up the suggestion as the University of Exeter study of 2017 emissions supplied both data and methodology.However, as we have seen, this study did not include imported emissions from aviation, shipping or supply chains. It also explicitly excluded emissions from domestic flights from Exeter Airport and inbound Exeter commuters.Exeter youth climate strikers. Photo: Vanessa Miles.Without including a baseline audit, or otherwise comprehensive emissions estimates to support city decision-making during the next decade, it is no surprise that the current “Net Zero” Exeter plan also makes no attempt to quantify the impact of its proposals over time.However these failures are inexcusable for another, more fundamental reason.It is more than a year since Exeter City Council finally declared a climate emergency, and longer since it committed the city to carbon neutrality by 2030.That time could have been used to get on with urgently-needed action based on freely available insight from established experts and established approaches that immediately help reduce carbon emissions.As the Exeter City Futures progress report itself said: “We don’t need to spend more time discussing what needs to be done”.Exeter youth climate strikers. Photo: Vanessa Miles.Instead the city spent twelve months and significant sums of public money on a document that lacks fundamental and necessary insight into the scale of the challenge the city faces.While some of the actions it proposes would, if implemented, reduce Exeter’s carbon footprint, the lack of quantifiable measures of success make it of limited use in any serious approach to carbon emissions reduction.We sincerely hope Exeter City Council’s “mission to be recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation” will motivate it to address the current plan’s shortcomings by adopting measures that match its rhetoric when the plan is updated later this year.These measures must include the true scale of Exeter’s current carbon footprint, including emissions from industry, waste, development, commuting, aviation, shipping and supply chains.They must also include credible alignments between elements of that footprint and the plan’s proposed actions which enable meaningful delivery monitoring focussed on specific outcomes which address all the city’s activities.Then, and only then, will it be possible to consider the size of the city’s residual emissions if all possible carbon reduction measures have been implemented, and to understand the consequences of failing to implement them.Then, and only then, will the extent of Exeter’s dependence on carbon offsetting to meet its carbon neutrality aim become clear, and meaningful decisions around how offsets should be supplied, and who should pay for them, can be taken."

"content" : "An assembly of the great and the good described by Exeter City Council’s chief executive, Karime Hassan, as “conscientious, talented people from all backgrounds who want to work in the best interests of the city” has been meeting in private in recent months.Its membership is unelected, it does not publish its discussions or decisions and it is taking responsibility for major policies which will determine Exeter’s future.The city council has had a predilection for such bodies for some time: recent arrangements have apparently included the Greater Exeter Visioning Board, the Exeter Local Transport Steering Board and the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan working group.Each of these other attempts at collaboration, however opaque, have largely been driven and constituted by local authorities. This new initiative goes much further in its scope, its membership and its agenda.Exeter College Hele Road campus construction siteWhat is now known as the Liveable Exeter Place Board started life in July 2019 when the council’s executive agreed a recommendation from its chief executive, Karime Hassan, to establish a Liveable Exeter Garden City Board.The purpose of the new board was described as “the vehicle through which Exeter will ensure that the desired transformational housing agenda known as Liveable Exeter Garden City is achieved” and “to support Exeter in its mission to be recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”.The garden city programme vision had been approved by the executive and the full council in February 2019.Mr Hassan’s recommendation continued: “The overarching aim of the board is to provide its constituent local authorities (Exeter and Devon County Council) and partners with a forum in which to address collaboratively issues relating to housing delivery, place shaping, economic development, clean growth, and carbon neutral development at a city and sub-regional level and to enable collective decision-making on issues that require agreement from the constituent authorities and other key public sector stakeholders” (our emphasis).Mr Hassan nevertheless stressed that nothing in the proposal was to be read as incorporating any executive functions properly exercised by councils.The recommendations were adopted by Exeter City Council in July 2019. The chief executive was authorised to settle the terms of reference and to identify suitable members for the board, then report back to the executive when this was done.No such report was ever received. The leader of the city council, Phil Bialyk, justified this at the June Executive committee meeting in response to a question from Councillor Diana Moore by saying: “The original draft terms of reference agreed by Council have not been amended in any meaningful way. Hence we have not reported back to Executive.”Independent small businesses in Gandy StreetThe failure to report back to the executive meant that the membership of the board was not made public.An enquiry to the council’s press office from Exeter Observer elicited a membership list. We subsequently established that a significant number of city councillors did not know who was on the board, a point only recently rectified at a private briefing for elected members.The chair is Sir Steve Smith, the about-to-retire vice chancellor of Exeter University. He has been a non-executive director of the Unite Group since April 2020. Unite is a major provider of purpose-built student accommodation, including at three locations in Exeter.He is also a board member of the Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership (HotSW LEP) which describes its role as “the main thought-leader influencing economic development in the HotSW area”. It aims to deliver the Local Industrial Strategy alongside “transformational opportunities” focussed on nuclear power, aerospace and maritime industries. It is responsible for many developments across the region including numerous road building schemes.A significant number of other place board members have known property and land interests.Steve Hindley, until recently chair of the HotSW LEP, is chair and chief executive of Midas Group, a regional construction company that has built, among other things, several student accommodation blocks in Exeter and elsewhere.Paul Crawford is chief executive of Livewest, a provider of affordable housing in the south west. He is also chair of lobby group Homes for the South West which argues that the government should prioritise the sale of public sector land for affordable housing.The Earl of Devon is a major local landowner. His family seat at Powderham Castle comprises 3,500 acres of land including four farms, 33 houses and three miles of foreshore. He is an elected hereditary member of the House of Lords and a partner at legal firm Michelmores.Julian Tagg, president of Exeter City Football Club is a director of OTR (Exeter) Ltd, a property management company.Charles Johnston, Sport England’s Executive Director of Property, is a former Director of Construction and Facilities at Sainsbury’s.Glenn Woodcock is a director of Oxygen House Group which owns Grenadier Estates, a residential and commercial property development company. He is also a director of Global City Futures, the consultancy behind Exeter City Futures, and sits as a governor of Exeter College alongside fellow place board members John Laramy and Matt Roach.Tony Rowe, chairman and chief executive of the Exeter Chiefs also holds directorships in property companies.Lady Studholme, chair of the trustees at the Northcott Theatre is, according to her Linkedin profile, a partner in the substantial Perridge Estate owned by her husband, Sir Harry Studholme, Baronet.John Laramy, principal and chief executive of Exeter College is also a HotSW LEP board member as well as a member of the Chartered Institute of Building.Matt Roach is managing director of Exeter International Airport and also chair of Exeter Chamber of Commerce &amp;amp; Industry, which represents the interests of numerous companies which are involved in property development in and around Exeter.The major public sector institutions in the city are also represented: University of Exeter, Exeter College, Met Office, Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter NHS trust, Devon &amp;amp; Cornwall Police and both Devon County Council and Exeter City Council. Most of these organisations are substantial land and property owners in their own right.

Source: Exeter City Council.At some point between July 2019 and May 2020 the Liveable Exeter Garden City Board morphed into the Liveable Exeter Place Board. A report to the city council’s executive meeting in June about plans for the city’s recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 virus explained the board’s role in the following terms:“The Liveable Exeter Place Board brings together all the major organisations in the city as well as private and voluntary sector figures. It allows for frank and candid confrontation of the issues they face in a manner that supports collaboration through a common purpose. The issues involved with a recovery plan for the city are broader than the city council and will benefit from being adopted by the place board.”The recovery plan is split into seven work streams which were already active at the time of the report to councillors. Six are chaired by place board members:  Business support - Matthew Roach (Managing Director, Exeter Airport)  City centre - John Laramy (Principal, Exeter College)  Visitor economy - Charles Courtenay (Earl of Devon)  Transport - Mike Watson (Managing Director, Stagecoach South West)  Construction and development - Sir Steve Smith (Vice-Chancellor, University of Exeter)  Community wellbeing - Dinah Cox (Chair, Devon Community Foundation)Each work stream has a lead council officer and is overseen by a member of the council’s senior management board which itself meets in private. The report did not identify a chair for the education work streamAt its June meeting the council’s executive agreed that the board should “adopt” the city’s coronavirus recovery plan and at the same time that it should also adopt the “Net Zero” Exeter plan intended to make the city carbon neutral by 2030. Bizarrely, this second decision was recorded as the place board adopting the “Liveable Exeter Place plan”.At its July meeting the council’s executive then agreed to add oversight of the Sport England local delivery pilot to the board’s portfolio. This gives the Liveable Exeter Place Board responsibility over four major city council policies and programmes (including the original garden city project).Exeter City Football Club St James Park Stagecoach Adam Stansfield StandExeter Observer’s initial enquiries revealed that the place board did have specific terms of reference but the city council’s spokesperson said only that: “its principal focus is to support the council in achieving and promoting its vision for the city”.In response to a question about openness the spokesperson said: “Minutes of the board are not published owing to the commercial and sensitive nature of some discussions – but any matters requiring council decisions or scrutiny would be progressed through the normal decision-making pathways and minutes produced accordingly”.Exeter Observer subsequently wrote to all non-council board members on the list provided by the council. We asked each member two questions: what they saw the board’s role as being in practice, and how they would describe their personal contribution to the board’s work.Only two replied, saying in effect that they could not comment until the board had discussed the issues we raised. A senior council officer then made contact to say that the board would collectively discuss our questions at its next meeting on 8 July.We responded by requesting that our concerns about the confidentiality of board proceedings would be addressed. This request was made in the context of a remark by Councillor Ollie Pearson, the council’s executive member for leisure and physical activity, at a Strategic Scrutiny committee meeting on 2 July when he referred to the place board as providing “the best and most transparent oversight” of the Sport England pilot.The place board met on 8 July, after which the city council issued the following statement in the name of its chief executive and growth director, Karime Hassan:“We are hugely grateful to the board for giving up their valuable time. They have adopted a vision of Exeter that is based on the premise of better life for all.“It is a vision that a district council couldn’t achieve on its own. There are all manner of challenges that the city needs to overcome.“Exeter is stronger for having conscientious, talented people from all backgrounds who want to work in the best interests of the city.“It shouldn’t be confused with a district council. Any decisions requiring council permission or funding are part of a transparent and democratic process that is the envy of the world.”Had the date been right, the final sentence might reasonably have been viewed as an April Fool’s joke: the city council cut scrutiny of its own decision-making in October last year.Independent small businesses beside Exeter Central StationThe city council’s acknowledgement that it cannot meet the challenges facing Exeter on its own is welcome and realistic. The council has set itself a huge and far-reaching agenda which, if implemented, would lead to major changes in the shape of the city and the way people interact with it.Setting up a group of advisers in response to such challenges is an approach with ample precedent in central government, where transparent expert advisory committees are (or at least were) a standard feature of policy-making.In practice, however, the Liveable Exeter Place Board has not got off to a good start against some of the claims made for it.The council claims that the board’s membership is “diverse” but the facts do not bear this out. For example, in terms of gender, it is male-dominated: only four of its 24 members are women. In terms of representation, its business members are from the construction, tourism, transport and sport sectors, with the rest from the usual pool of public sector bodies with a dash of high culture thrown in.There is no seat round the table for the retail, food or hospitality sectors, nor for the small, independent businesses that are integral to the city’s economy. No one on the board appears able to claim recent experience of the hardship, disadvantage and poverty experienced by many Exeter residents. No one speaks for community groups (the Devon Community Foundation is a grant-giving body).Nor does council coyness about the board’s role and activities inspire trust. Roles sketched out for the original board in July 2019 included (our emphasis):  Develop and set joint investment strategies for the city and sub-region  Develop an infrastructure plan in support of the Liveable Exeter Garden City and as and when required the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan and associated sub-regional transport strategy  Consider and prioritise bids for external funding, including leading on housing, industrial and other appropriate deals  Consider, approve and implement decisions relating to Exeter and as appropriate subregional investment, including expenditure of external funding within the sub-region.We do not know whether these functions found their way into the place board’s terms of reference, as the council has not provided that level of detail. If they did, then these are important matters in which there is significant public interest. Not all these actions will necessarily come to the city or county councils for formal decisions to be made and so will not be exposed to “a transparent and democratic process that is the envy of the world”.The composition of the board also raises questions about level playing fields and competitiveness. Are, for example, the construction and transport companies whose bosses sit on the board getting an inside track into development and funding plans not available to their competitors? There is no suggestion that they are, but there is no objective reassurance that they are not.

"content" : "When the coronavirus pandemic broke out, the government announced £3.2 million in emergency funding for local authorities to move all rough sleepers and other vulnerable homeless people into temporary accommodation. Each local authority allocation was based on the number of rough sleepers it reported in the autumn 2019 snapshot count.Exeter’s performance in the count was poor: it reported the 25th highest number of rough sleepers among 316 local authorities in England, with a higher rate of rough sleeping per capita than Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds and Manchester, as well as London boroughs including Southwark, Lambeth and Haringey.The 2019 count also revealed that the south west was the only region to show a significant increase in the number of people sleeping rough. 490 people, 11% of the country’s rough sleepers, live in the south west, a 7% increase on the previous year. Exeter was one of three rough sleeping hotspots in the region, alongside Bournemouth and Bristol, which has the third highest numbers of rough sleepers the country.South West rough sleeping snapshot count autumn 2019. Source: MHCLG.Exeter was among the 83 local authorities in England targeted by the government’s Rough Sleeping Initiative (RSI) when it was launched in March 2018. The scheme is based on an earlier, similar initiative. It funds councils with the highest numbers of people sleeping rough to provide specialist services to help the most vulnerable people in society off the streets and into secure accommodation.The scheme generated controversy. Sir David Norgrove, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, said that subsequent government claims that the number of rough sleepers was falling should not be trusted until the government addressed concerns that some councils which had received RSI funding had underreported the scale of rough sleeping in their area after receiving money from the scheme.Exeter was one of several local authorities identified in the controversy. It reported figures that showed that the number of rough sleepers in the city halved between 2017 and 2018, from 35 to seventeen.Critics pointed at a change in methodology from using multi-agency estimates based on year-round work with rough sleepers to a single snapshot count on one night each year.Exeter City Council has switched methodology several times since 2010. Snapshot counts have consistently shown lower levels of rough sleeping in the city than estimates based on year-round experience.However, after switching from an estimate in 2017 to a count in 2018, and reporting a precipitous drop in numbers, the city also used a count in 2019, which showed the number of rough sleepers nearly doubling to return to just below 2017 levels.The precipitous drop in 2018 may partly be explained by the opening of the new RSI-funded Magdalen Street night shelter just before the count took place, when 28 people slept there.And the increase at the 2019 count may also be connected to just seventeen people sleeping at the shelter on that night, when 31 people were counted as sleeping rough.Exeter rough sleepers + night shelter occupants on snapshot count nights. Sources: MHCLG &amp;amp; ECC.The city council has received over £2.15 million under the Rough Sleeping Initiative and its Rapid Rehousing Pathway since 2018.When it received its third allocation of just over £900,000 in January this year, it said: “Unfortunately Exeter recorded an increase in rough sleeping numbers during the recent autumn count so this funding is desperately needed to ensure that future numbers remain low.“The funding will continue to support existing projects such as the night shelter and our housing first project and ensure that these vital projects are able to continue after April.“Further details on how this funding will be used to tackle rough sleeping in Exeter will be released over the coming months.”However, the persistently high number of rough sleepers in the city has prompted questions from opposition councillors about the use of this money.Diana Moore, Green party councillor for St David’s, said: “Rough sleeping over the past year in Exeter almost doubled, with an alarming rise in women sleeping rough. We really need to understand the reasons for this rise and the effectiveness of spending by the Labour-led council.”When asked whether the city’s rough sleeping strategy was working, a council spokesperson said: “Comparison based on official rough sleeping figures does not convey a full picture of regional or local issues and flow (sources of people at risk of rough sleeping) and does not reflect measures of success.“Eighteen of the 31 persons had no identified local connection to Exeter at the time of the 2019 count.“Under the RSI programme Exeter’s commissioned services have provided a total of 61 new accommodation units including night shelter bedspaces and independent tenancies for persons who were known rough sleepers or had very recent experience of rough sleeping.“The council continues to work to develop further services to help increase accommodation units for rough sleepers. It also works alongside partner agencies to continue to prevent homelessness and reduce the risk of further people rough sleeping on the streets of Exeter.”Magdalen Street night shelterThe relationship between rough sleeping and access to accommodation is complex. A council spokesperson said: “Not all persons found rough sleeping were actually homeless. Five had suitable accommodation available to them and a further ten were eligible to access the night shelter but chose not to at the time of the count.”When asked whether the night shelter, which was then open only during winter months, was effectively suppressing the Exeter rough sleepers count, the spokesperson said: “It is likely that in the absence of additional safe, secure accommodation such as that provided by the night shelter, rough sleeper count numbers would be higher.“However it is not necessarily the case that an increase would equate to the numbers using the night shelter as it cannot be assumed that all occupants would have otherwise slept rough.”The government defines rough sleepers as “those sleeping or about to bed down in open air locations and other places including tents and make-shift shelters”. The definition excludes people in hostels or shelters despite such facilities often closing, as Magdalen Street night shelter does, every day before reopening in the evening to admit overnight guests.It also says “the term ‘homelessness’ is much broader than people sleeping rough” which is borne out by the much larger number of people who are homeless than are counted as sleeping rough.According to government figures, 267 households were homeless in Exeter at the end of last year, with 90 housed in temporary accommodation. This is in addition to the 31 people who were officially counted as sleeping rough in the city.However a survey of the numbers moved into temporary COVID-19 accommodation under the government emergency scheme announced in March has suggested that official rough sleeping figures, based on snapshot counts, are far lower than the reality across the country.It revealed that nearly 15,000 people were moved off the streets into hotels, B&amp;amp;Bs and other forms of self-contained temporary accommodation, nearly three and a half times the number counted at the 2019 snapshot.England rough sleeping snapshot counts since 2010. Source: MHCLG.Exeter City Council has not confirmed how much it received from the government’s £3.2 million emergency fund to move rough sleepers into temporary accommodation, but it has imposed a service charge on those who were moved into the Great Western Hotel beside St David’s station.Diana Moore said: “The council’s emergency housing team did an incredible job getting everyone off the streets and into accommodation at very little notice at the start of the pandemic. During lockdown, the council helped people claim housing benefit and universal credit and community services have done an amazing job to provide other support and meal.“This is really a positive start. But it was not reasonable for an additional surcharge on top of the rent to be imposed by the council after people had moved in. This is not an ordinary housing situation and this charge and any arrears should be cancelled.”Kevin Mitchell, Liberal Democrat councillor for Duryard &amp;amp; St James and progressive group leader said: “I am very concerned by the decision to issue a service charge on our homeless individuals after they were housed in a local hotel. I feel this was a wholly unnecessary step at this difficult time.“My progressive group colleagues and I have been pressing for a change of heart. I would also call upon the Labour administration to agree to work with members of all groups on the council, so that collectively we can agree an action plan to ensure that no one in our city is sleeping rough.”Great Western Hotel beside Exeter St David’s railway stationMeanwhile a report leaked to Manchester Evening News revealed that the temporary accommodation funding has been quietly scrapped, although the government has said councils can use their share of the £3.2 billion coronavirus response funding that was announced in March and April to support rough sleepers.When asked whether any of the £2.15 million Exeter City Council had previously received in RSI funding had been allocated to cover the costs of housing residents during the lockdown period, a council spokesperson said: “This is currently being explored with a view to assisting needs on a case by case basis with a primary focus on extending discretionary housing and maximising move-on into more stable housing wherever possible.”Diana Moore, whose ward includes the Magdalen Street night shelter, said: “A significant amount of the RSI funding has been spent on the night shelter, but with the risk associated with COVID-19 it will need to have a much more limited capacity, if any role at all.“The priority must be to break the cycle of supporting people to sleep rough or in the hostel and ensure the next move is into long-term sustainable and affordable homes, with the necessary support, to help people cope and recover from their experiences on the streets.”Emma Morse, Labour party councillor for Mincinglake &amp;amp; Whipton and Portfolio Holder for Supporting People, was asked about the matters raised in this story but did not respond."

"content" : "Exeter City Council has accepted a plan intended to make the city carbon neutral by 2030. At a meeting on Tuesday its Executive agreed to recommend that the Net Zero Exeter plan published by Exeter City Futures in April should be adopted by the council as a policy “to inform all policy documents, plans and corporate decision making in response to the climate emergency”.The plan sets out a range of actions that Exeter City Futures believes can deliver the city council’s target of a carbon neutral Exeter by 2030. The actions are to be taken by Exeter City Council and Devon County Council as well as organisations and individuals across the city. The plan’s 26 priority actions come with estimated carbon savings and indicative timescales attached to each, but the plan is an indicative route map rather than an operational document.The plan was developed from a “blueprint” published by Exeter City Futures in February. It claims extensive community, business and political involvement in its production. Council leader Phil Bialyk stressed in his remarks to the Executive that what was particularly good about the plan was that had they had “consulted with a number of groups”.The total number of participants in online and physical events was 302. Three events were cancelled due to COVID-19, including a “mobilisation summit” planned for 26 March.A report to the executive by the city council chief executive Karime Hassan made further recommendations about the future handling of the plan, covering finance and governance.Mr Hassan told the meeting that the lack of resources, both human and financial, meant that the city council cannot take practical action now in delivering its part of the plan beyond building its principles into work already underway and planned.The loss of income from car parking and other fees due to the coronavirus pandemic together with a decade of funding cuts by central government had left the council in a very difficult financial position. There would be an emergency budget brought to councillors in July.The report claimed that it “could require close to £1 billion to achieve a net zero Exeter”, presumably based on indicative costs outlined in the plan, which are mostly given as minimums. Councillors gave Mr Hassan authority to explore new opportunities to secure investment and to create mechanisms for funding the programmes set out the plan.They also noted that he would report further on how to deliver those actions in the plan which fell to the council once the council’s financial situation, which depended on whether further support would be available from central government, had been clarified.Exeter City Council Executive Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan decisionThe plan’s authors recognised that the pandemic may prompt further changes to the recommended actions, stating in the preface that “Exeter City Futures will listen to how people view the plan in light of the current climate and reissue this document towards the end of the year to incorporate these changing attitudes”.Even without such changes there are elements of the plan that will be seen by some as not going far enough, for example the proposal to confine new 20 mph speed limits to “high-density areas” and the low bar that has been set for active travel modes.On governance, councillors recognised that achieving many of the goals in the plan would require action by others than the city council. They agreed Mr Hassan’s recommendation that the council should approve the Liveable Exeter Place Board as “the appropriate body to adopt the Liveable Exeter Place plan on behalf of the city of Exeter”, on the grounds that the board “is the one body that already convenes many of the largest organisations in the city”.It is not clear why the recorded decision referred to the “Liveable Exeter Place plan” and not the Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan.The creation of the Liveable Exeter Place Board was agreed by the city council’s Executive in July 2019. Its composition and terms of reference were to be reported back to a future meeting of the Executive, but no report has since appeared.A council spokesperson said its role is “to support the council in achieving and promoting its vision for the city” and that its members are “drawn from a diverse range of leading public and private sector organisations within the city and from national agencies”.Its chair is Sir Steve Smith, the retiring vice-chancellor of Exeter University. Among its 23 other members are Lord Charles Courtenay, Earl of Devon, Matt Roach, Managing Director of Exeter Airport and Simon Jupp, MP for East Devon. The board meets in private and does not publish minutes of its meetings.Mr Hassan’s recommendations were accepted in full by the executive, without comment from the leaders of the two opposition groups. They will be put forward for approval at a full council meeting on 21 July.Exeter City Futures’ Plan for a Net Zero Exeter sets out a series of actions that local authorities, organisations and individuals can take, with associated carbon savings and cost, all of which Exeter will need to put in place in order to meet the city council’s target of a net-zero carbon city by 2030.They include a city-wide low carbon mobility scheme, supported by integrated multi-modal ticketing, that improves movement into and around the city, making the city centre and core walking areas free from non-essential motorised vehicles, and revising the local plan to identify sites for new housing and commercial developments that can be served by quality public transport links and attractive cycle and walking connections.Key figures in the plan include an estimated saving of 53,000 tonnes of carbon if all of Exeter’s electricity was generated from clean sources, and an estimated saving of 140,000 tonnes of carbon if Exeter were to exploit the maximum potential for renewable generation.The plan is built on the understanding that success will only be achieved through a genuinely collective effort from everyone.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Dr Liz O’Driscoll, who led Exeter City Futures from its inception until April 2020, said: “[The plan] has been four years in the making with collaboration with the many different communities, institutions, organisations and individuals who make up our city.“Everyone across Exeter has a role to play, this isn’t something that can be delivered by any local authority alone. This plan represents the contribution of hundreds of businesses and individuals across Exeter, who have engaged with us to set out the action plan to become a carbon-neutral city.“Many businesses and individuals are now struggling to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 and this is likely to change the way the city views and responds to the plan. More than ever the city needs to come together to think about the kind of future that we really want, and make it a reality.”The plan includes 26 priority actions that it says should be taken in order to maximise carbon reduction in the city. Some would have a very limited cost, such as encouraging organisations to use more renewable energy, while others, such as retrofitting housing stocks, could cost more than £100 million.The indicative cost given for the launch of a city-wide low carbon mobility scheme, supported by integrated multi-modal ticketing, that improves movement into and around the city, is more than £500 million.  Net Zero Exeter 2030 plan priority actions      Encourage all organisations in Exeter (including schools) to commit to energy reduction measures, including demand reduction, upgrade of building insulation and heating.    Refine local planning policy so that it requires the highest energy efficiency standards (e.g. passive) in all new domestic, industrial, commercial and public buildings.    Ensure that 100% of electricity consumed by the city is generated from clean sources.    Conduct multi-authority strategic planning to exploit the maximum potential for renewable generation (solar, wind, geothermal).    Transition public-sector buildings to locally generated renewable sources of energy (e.g. solar, district heat networks).    Enable retrofit of domestic homes across the city to achieve energy performance ratings of C+.    Retrofit council-owned properties using programmes such as EnergieSprong (or equivalent).    Enforce private rental standards to ensure that all properties meet minimum energy performance ratings (A-E).    Revise the local plan to identify sites for new housing and commercial developments that can be served by quality public transport links and attractive cycle and walking connections.    Launch a city-wide low carbon mobility scheme, supported by integrated multi-modal ticketing, that improves movement into and around the city.    Deliver a safe, segregated, convenient cycle and walking network that is accessible to all supported by infrastructure across the city centre and at major employment/education sites    Encourage all Exeter businesses to implement sustainable travel initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint.    Build a network of work and healthcare hubs in Exeter’s travel-to-work area, contributing to a reduction in the need to travel into the city for work or health.    Make the city centre, and core walking areas, free from non-essential motorised vehicles to provide a vibrant public space and free up land currently used for driving and parking.    Establish freight consolidation centres at key access routes to reduce the number of vehicles entering the city; ensure onward deliveries within the city centre are made by non-fossil fuel vehicles.    Initiate programmes that enable residents and schools to adopt more sustainable and healthy food habits (e.g. promoting a plant-based menu, and sustainably sourced meat and fish).    Increase Exeter’s tree canopy cover by a quarter, compared to 2018 figures.    Replace existing buses in Exeter’s network with Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) Buses using non-fossil fuels.    Ensure all public sector fleet vehicles across the city are ULEV/non-fossil fuel. Use licensing to require that Exeter’s taxi and private hire companies transition their vehicles to ULEV/non-fossil fuels.    Enable a shift to all private cars across the city being in the ULEV category.    Deliver a comprehensive network of electric vehicle charging points (including on-street) to support transition to electric vehicles, with priority for shared vehicles.    Reduce business waste and where possible use residual business waste to support a circular economy (e.g. by providing source material for industries such as construction).    Halve the per capita food waste at retail and consumer level by encouraging sustainable food consumption and production.    Support Exeter’s businesses and organisations in accessing resources that help them reduce their carbon outputs.    Ensure city purchasing decisions support a “just transition” with organisations using procurement contracts to stimulate innovation and encourage their supply chain to become carbon-neutral.    Establish a fund to provide a source of finance for carbon reduction projects and to support emission reductions from existing buildings, where achieving carbon savings can be more challenging.  Underpinning the priorities is a set of specific actions that will need to be taken by Exeter City Council, by Devon County Council, and by organisations and individuals.These actions are grouped into those that will be taken in the short term (by 2022), medium term (2023-2026) and long term (2027-2030).Exeter City Futures’ work is intended to feed into wider planning by the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group. However the city has not signed the Devon Climate Declaration despite being a member of the group and it is not clear how the two initiatives will combine.The full plan is available for download here."

"content" : "Devon County Council has delivered none of the pop-up infrastructure it proposed to enable safe cycling and walking in Exeter during the coronavirus pandemic.Andrew Leadbetter, county councillor for Wearside &amp;amp; Topsham and Exeter’s only county cabinet member, confirmed that proposals outlined by the county nearly three weeks ago would be delivered by today.However no changes have been made to the road layout on Fore Street, South Street, North Street, Cowick Street or Magdalen Road.Andrew Leadbetter also said proposals to accelerate the delivery of planned changes on Union Road, as part of the E4 cycle route linking Exeter Science Park with the university, would be considered. But no action has so far been taken.He said: “This work does cost money and is partly reliant on us getting the money from government. But we want to do this and we are going with temporary traffic orders so we can put these things in.”Cyclists, pedestrians and cars compete for space on Union Road todayThe government announced a £250 million emergency active travel fund on 9 May directing local highways authorities to reallocate road space to walking and cycling to relieve pressure on public transport as lockdown eases.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “The government expects local authorities to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians”.The accompanying guidance said “whole route” approaches should be taken to “create corridors for buses, cycles and access only on key routes into town and city centres”.The government directed Devon County Council to implement such measures “as swiftly as possible, and in any event within weeks, given the urgent need to change travel habits before the restart takes full effect”.According to legal advice received by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cycling and Walking, councils are compelled to make the changes and central government could step in to take powers away from councils to ensure interventions are made.But despite receiving a share of the fund worth nearly £1.7 million last week Devon County Council has yet to implement the government’s wishes.Vehicles on Cowick Street todayThe Department for Transport wrote to Devon County Council on 27 May to confirm that the money would be made available “so that work can begin at pace on closing roads to through traffic, installing segregated cycle lanes and widening pavements”.Rupert Furness, deputy director for active and accessible travel, said: “The main purpose of the initial funding is to promote cycling as a replacement for journeys previously made by public transport”.He added: “The amounts are only indicative. To receive any money under this or future tranches, you will need to show us that you have swift and meaningful plans to reallocate road space to cyclists and pedestrians, including on strategic corridors.“Anything that does not meaningfully alter the status quo on the road will not be funded.”However while a statement from the county council the following day acknowledged that traffic on Devon’s roads had increased by 50% from lockdown levels and that average speeds had also risen, it simply encouraged road users to be more considerate of each other.And in a recent road space reallocation guidance document the county said that the strategic route changes directed by the transport secretary are “unlikely to be delivered as part of this initiative”.Ludwell Lane (Devon County Council traffic regulation order notice marked in red)Meanwhile, notices have appeared on Ludwell Lane which say that a fifteen metre section has been closed to through traffic from today to enable COVID-19 transport response works.Local residents out walking their dogs said they had not been contacted about the road closure despite living immediately beside it.At the same time a series of vehicles drove along the closed section in both directions, prompting them to question how the highways authority planned to enforce the change.On hearing of the Department of Transport funding, they joked that Devon County Council must be trying to pass Ludwell Lane off as a strategic corridor while leaving Alphington Road, Topsham Road and Heavitree Road untouched.UPDATE – 3 June 2020Following publication of this story, Devon County Council issued a news release outlining its plans in more detail and added additional information to its website.It also responded to questions about the delay with a statement. A spokesperson said: “We had hoped work could start on 1 June, but contractor availability has unfortunately not made that possible.“We expect to receive the initial payment of £338,000, specifically for initial temporary walking and cycling improvements, once the Department for Transport has reviewed our plans which need to be submitted this Friday 5 June.“Traffic order notices are already going up in areas where measures will be introduced over the coming weeks, as soon as contractors are available. These measures have to be introduced within eight weeks of receiving the funding.”Traffic regulation order notices for the planned changes are not yet available on the county’s website, but may be found in affected streets.UPDATE – 8 June 2020We asked further questions about the timing of the planned changes but have not so far received a reply.We asked whether the procurement of contractors to deliver the proposed changes was contingent on Department for Transport approval of submitted plans, and so cannot take place until approval is confirmed.We asked, if so, how works could have commenced (or been completed, as stated by Andrew Leadbetter) on 1 June when the deadline for submission of plans was 5 June and, if not, when the county first became aware that no contractor was available to commence (or complete) the works by that date, and for what reason was no other contractor was procured to complete the works.We also asked, given that the Department for Transport fund must be spent within eight weeks of approval of submitted plans, as per government guidance, whether delivery would be contingent on the availability of contractors such that, should contractors not be available, as has apparently already caused delay, delivery would not take place."

"content" : "Two weeks have passed since the government announced a £250 million emergency active travel fund in response to dramatic increases in walking and cycling during coronavirus lockdown.The fund is intended to relieve pressure on public transport as lockdown eases by enabling local authorities to create pop-up bike lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements for pedestrians and car-free corridors to ensure higher levels of active travel can continue.Public transport will only be able to carry one tenth of its previous capacity under social distancing restrictions that are likely to last until at least the end of this year, so the transport network is likely to be overwhelmed as people return to work unless they travel on foot or by bike.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “Our trains and buses could become overcrowded and our roads gridlocked, holding up emergency services, critical workers and vital supplies.“The coronavirus crisis has  resulted in cleaner air and quieter streets, transforming the environment in many of our towns and cities. And millions of people have discovered, or rediscovered, cycling and walking.“When the country gets back to work, we need them to carry on cycling, and to be joined by millions more. That is why towns and cities in the UK and around the world are making or proposing radical changes to their roads to accommodate active travel.“We recognise this moment for what it is: a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a lasting transformative change in how we make short journeys in our towns and cities.“The government therefore expects local authorities to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians.”Cyclists and pedestrians find social distancing difficult on Exeter quaysideAt the same time the government issued new statutory guidance to Devon County Council outlining the actions it should take as highways authority to reallocate road space to walking and cycling.They include installing mandatory cycle lanes which separate riders from traffic, quickly converting traffic lanes into temporary cycle lanes (suspending parking bays where necessary), and using cones and barriers to widen footways along lengths of road.They also include introducing pedestrian and cycle zones by restricting access for motor vehicles to specific streets or networks of streets, particularly town centres and high streets, and closing roads to motor traffic using planters or large barriers to create modal filters.The guidance says “whole route” approaches should be taken to “create corridors for buses, cycles and access only on key routes into town and city centres”.The government has directed Devon County Council to implement these measures, among others, “as swiftly as possible, and in any event within weeks, given the urgent need to change travel habits before the restart takes full effect”.The Traffic Regulation Orders that would normally make such changes costly for the council have either been waived or made easier to implement, and it has been directed to make changes “with a view to making them permanent, and embedding a long-term shift to active travel”.According to legal advice received by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cycling and Walking, councils are compelled to make the changes and central government could step in to take powers away from councils to ensure interventions are made.However Devon County Council has yet to take action in Exeter.Department for Transport coronavirus road signThe Department for Transport also announced that the Prime Minister would launch an updated Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy in June with further measures to support the government’s cycling and walking aims.Devon County Council was initially required to create an Exeter Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan under this strategy in April 2017. However three years have since passed without it producing such a plan, despite Exeter Cycling Campaign highlighting its importance in September 2018.Since then the role of such plans in active travel funding has become more significant, to the extent that councils that have included them in their transport policy frameworks or have local transport plans with ambitious cycling and walking schemes are more likely to receive funding under the current emergency scheme.The Exeter Transport Steering Group, created at the end of 2017 to “advise on the formulation of transport policy for Exeter and its travel to work area”  acknowledged in September 2018 that Devon County Council was expected to produce the plans the Department for Transport required no later than summer 2019. Whether the steering group responded to Devon County Council’s failure to meet the government deadline is not known, as the decisions taken at its most recent meeting in October 2019 have never been published.This steering group also oversaw the development of the Exeter Transport Strategy update. It approved the draft at its December 2018 meeting and agreed to take it to a public consultation in January 2019.When the resulting consultation document appeared it received widespread criticism. It did not mention low emission or clean air zones, congestion charging or climate change at all, an omission Exeter Cycling Campaign “noted with incredulity” in a detailed point by point response.It did however say it aimed to “facilitate the increase of car-based inward commuters from outside the city”.Extinction Rebellion Exeter DIY coronavirus cycle lane bike signExeter Cycling Campaign said Devon County Council’s road safety vision statement “that every route and every mode should be available to everybody, free from the risk or fear of harm” was “far from the reality on our roads”. It also pointed out that the strategy lacked “even a high level timetable”.Exeter Green Party said it was “a fundamentally flawed document that we believe is entirely unfit to meet the multiple, challenges that Exeter faces in relation to transport and related issues, including air pollution”.Exeter City Council’s consultation response also criticised the draft strategy for its lack of ambition and emphasised the importance of walking, cycling and public transport over private car use.It said: “The city council believes that the time for radical change is upon us, that a step change is needed to encourage people to opt for sustainable travel modes in preference to the car, and that past prevarication about what needs to be done cannot continue.“The city council believes that there is public support for putting pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users first.“The city council strongly supports the need to further reduce the dominance of the car in the city centre and other locations by removing traffic and re-dedicating highway space for public transport, pedestrians and cyclists.“We should be aspiring to the creation of a city where residents, commuters and visitors can access the city through green options that maximise clean air and space for walking, cycling and public transport”.A pedestrian steps into the road to maintain social distance on Queen StreetBy the end of the consultation Devon County Council had received around 1100 responses (representing less than 0.1% of the county’s 1.2 million residents), which it said showed “widespread support” for the draft strategy. The final version of the document was due for approval at the September 2019 county cabinet meeting, but was delayed without explanation in July to “between October and December” last year.In November 2019 it was again delayed, until April 2020, only to disappear altogether from the county cabinet forward plan the month before it was due. There is no mention of it in the current forward plan, which lists planned decisions to March 2021.When asked why the Exeter Transport Strategy had not been published at the county cabinet’s March 2020 meeting, Devon County County leader John Hart said: “Local and national transportation-related issues continue to occur such as changes in shopping patterns, edge of centre developments, rail (Marsh Barton station) and bus changes including patronage.“In particular, the council has announced a climate emergency, continuing concern regarding air quality and there is a new government with emerging policies. We are also reflecting how this sits alongside the city council’s emerging Liveable Exeter proposals. This has resulted in a considerable amount of work.”However all these factors predate the consultation’s conclusion, and none explain why the decision to postpone the strategy was taken five months later in July.Rydon Lane retail park was completed in 1995, the same year Amazon and eBay launched, and Stagecoach has run the majority of Exeter’s bus services since 1996.Exeter City Council and Devon County Council have both had statutory responsibilities to improve Exeter’s air quality since 2007 and Devon County Council published its Local Transport Plan in 2011, since when there have been three changes of government.Marsh Barton railway station was planned in 2013 and has been due since 2016. And the city council published its Liveable Exeter proposals on 7 February 2019, the county council declared a climate emergency on 21 February 2019 and the draft Exeter Transport Strategy consultation concluded on 28 February 2019, one week later.

Moreover, despite the additional demands made on Devon County Council’s resources by the pandemic because of its public health and social care responsibilities, it has found the resources to update its Transport Infrastructure Plan, which covers 110 schemes across the county (of which just four are funded walking and cycling schemes in Exeter), and to make decisions about more than £116 million of transport spending.Of this, just 3% of the £47 million 2020-21 transport capital programme and less than 5% of the £43 million 2020-21 highway maintenance capital budget will be spent on cycling and walking infrastructure in Exeter (the second figure includes 3.18% for footways and 1.58% for public rights of way, unsurfaced roads and cycling combined).And while the county allocated 11.8% of its £26 million 2020-21 highway maintenance revenue budget to routine maintenance including cycle routes, the same fund is used for drainage, fencing, traffic signs, road markings and traffic signals too.These sums are far short of the  15% of their transport infrastructure funding the Department for Transport encouraged local authorities to spend on walking and cycling in November 2018.John Hart was also asked in March why Devon County Council is not making the reduction of car use in Exeter a high priority, but declined to answer.Pedestrians step into the road to maintain social distance beside a queue on Queen StreetBefore last week’s cabinet meeting, at which most of this spending was decided, county council Liberal Democrat group leader Alan Connett called for what he called the county’s “old world” programme, designed before the coronavirus outbreak, to be reshaped in response to the government announcement that people should walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport as lockdown is lifted.He asked the county to identify a priority list of “quick wins” that would make it safer for people to walk and cycle, adding: “Now is the time to be looking right across all the county council’s highways budgets and plans so we can put more into public transport, cycling and walking. The urgency is now, not in next year’s budget round.“Before the lockdown comes to an end and the schools start back, we need to have really thought about what the new world of travelling to work and school will be. Now is the time to be looking at this in detail and, in effect, ripping-up the highways budget approved in February and starting again.”At the same time Exeter Cycling Campaign published a crowd-sourced analysis of Exeter pinch points which make social distancing difficult with suggestions for making them safe under the new government guidelines.It recommends interventions on key arterial routes including Heavitree Road, Alphington Road and Cowick Street as well as the Barrack Road/Polsloe Road/Mount Pleasant Road route to the Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter hospital at Wonford and Queen Street near Exeter College.It also recommends the removal of motor traffic on Fore Street and Topsham High Street, the expedition of the existing E4 scheme on Union Road and modal filtering in residential areas including St James, St Leonards and Heavitree.The campaign group said: “The idea is to help people feel safe enough to choose active travel. This means paths that protect those cycling from cars, lower speed limits, and pedestrian- and cycle-only zones. It also includes cutting out rat-runs to create low traffic neighbourhoods, safe school areas and changes to junctions.”Mike Walton of Exeter Cycling Campaign said: “During the lockdown we’ve glimpsed a new future for Exeter. A future where our children can travel safely across the city, where the air is clean and where the car doesn’t dominate local neighbourhoods.“Many people, many families, want to cycle and will do so if it feels safe. Just imagine how different Exeter would be if most of our short journeys were people-powered.“We’re heartened to hear the government tell local authorities to get things done. It provides the mandate to Devon County Council to urgently lock in safe, convenient and connected routes for people to walk and cycle.”Stuart Hughes, county council member for highway management, was asked at last week’s meeting to specify where the county would make the changes directed by the transport secretary.He replied that the focus would be “on city and town centres where narrow footways could restrict pedestrian movement and on our urban walking and cycling networks where funding may enable us to fill gaps”.In a statement the county then confirmed that temporary measures were “being explored” to extend and improve the existing walking and cycling network.However the changes outlined in Exeter include only minor interventions in the city centre and in some residential streets and fall far short of the “new era” of “lasting transformative change” involving “significant changes to road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians” envisaged by the government.And by indicating that it will consider only existing schemes, and in the absence of a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan or Exeter Transport Strategy which prioritises walking and cycling over private cars in the city, Devon County Council has effectively ruled out following government guidelines to make significant changes in Exeter city centre or on its key arterial routes.Pop-up cycle lanes in Milan. Photo: @demescope.Other UK cities have not wasted time in seizing the opportunity that the government has presented. The City of London is banning cars on all the arterial routes in the square mile. The first phase will be complete by the end of next week.Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, has announced plans to ban cars and vans from many other major central London roads as well as Waterloo Bridge and London Bridge. He said: “We have no choice but to rapidly repurpose London’s streets for people. By ensuring our city’s recovery is green we will also tackle our toxic air, which is vital to make sure we don’t replace one public health crisis with another”.Hackney Borough Council decided to filter its streets using bollards and planters on 20 April, three weeks before the Transport Secretary’s announcement, and other councils are closing roads near schools to deter people from driving to drop off and pick up their children.Manchester has closed the Deansgate area of its city centre to traffic altogether and Bristol is following suit, with plans to restrict major city centre routes, close Bristol Bridge to private vehicles and pedestrianise much of its Old City area. Birmingham, Sheffield and Leicester have all fast-tracked similar plans.Cities across Europe are also making dramatic changes to their roads as lockdown eases. Berlin  has created fourteen miles of new bike lanes in three days. Milan has created 22 miles of new lanes and Brussels 25 miles, with the entire city centre now designated as “slow streets” where pedestrians and cyclists have priority over car drivers.Athens has allocated 50,000m2 of public space to cyclists and pedestrians and Paris, which has already created twenty miles of new cycling infrastructure, has plans for another 30 miles. Mayor Anne Hidalgo said: “It is out of the question for the city to return to the pre-coronavirus traffic jams and vehicle pollution”.Pop-up cycle lanes in Paris. Photo: @ParisBeauAVelo.Diana Moore, Exeter Green Party councillor for St David’s, agrees. She said: “Creating more space for walkers and cyclists in Exeter is vital to keep people safe from infection and help prevent a return to the congestion and air pollution that plagued our city before the COVID-19 crisis and subsequent lockdown.“Public transport will be unable to cope safely with high passenger numbers, so increasing active travel, especially for the 40% of urban journeys that are less than two miles, will be the only way to prevent gridlock in Exeter.“We need a joined-up approach to enable people to cycle safely into and around the city centre and to places of work. This will mean reallocating space on sections of major routes.”Meanwhile Extinction Rebellion Exeter has stepped in to create DIY pop-up bike lanes in the city centre in response to council inaction. The group said it wanted to highlight the need to make the streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Members then demonstrated the need for full-width lanes to maintain social distancing when riding bikes.Caspar Hughes of Stop Killing Cyclists said: “While other councils are rapidly changing their streets to make them safe when lockdown eases, Devon County Council is doing nothing.“Local authorities all over the country are making use of the government’s relaxation of Traffic Regulation Orders to install wider pavements and protected space for walking and cycling”.Cyclists demonstrate socially distanced cycling on Exeter High StreetAs the clean air and calm that made walking and cycling in Exeter a pleasure for the first time in decades give way to rapidly rising levels of returning traffic, polls show that only 9% of us want to return to life as it was before the pandemic and that 71% are concerned about air pollution returning to pre-lockdown levels.With studies showing that air pollution levels are linked with COVID-19 symptom severity as well as death rates, and that 1750 fewer deaths occurred in the UK during lockdown due to dramatically improved air quality, campaigners are calling for widespread implementation of the government’s intended transport system changes.In an open letter to local authority leaders and ministers, nine organisations including Greenpeace, Transport Action Network, Cycling UK and Living Streets said: “It would be completely absurd if, after the unprecedented efforts and sacrifices made to save thousands of lives from COVID-19, we allowed thousands more to be cut short by the devastating impacts of toxic pollution”.However the much higher levels of active travel seen during lockdown that have led to a 50% drop in air pollution in Exeter city centre will continue only if local authorities make the significant changes that give more space to cyclists and pedestrians that the government expects.And the 61% who feel cycling on the road is too dangerous seem to have a point in Exeter, where 39% of 255 road accident casualities in 2018 involved pedestrians or cyclists.80 year-old grandmother Margaret Turner said: “As a seasoned cyclist I also ride on the roads but always, until the lockdown, felt I was taking my life in my hands.“It’s noticeable how few people normally cycle in Exeter. As a grandparent I would feel very anxious about my grandchild venturing on the roads as they are. We need visible, wide cycle lanes which are well sign-posted and separated from motorised traffic.”Cyclists demonstrate socially distanced cycling on Western WayWith 58% of us supporting the introduction of cycle lanes on all main roads in urban areas and NHS leaders urging councils to deliver on the Transport Secretary’s promises as part of the Keyworkers Need Streetspace campaign, such changes would be popular as well as prudent.And there’s no room for complacency. University of Cambridge research shows that while infection numbers remain stable, infection rates in the south west are the highest in the country after Yorkshire.Nor does the 17% reduction in global carbon emissions in April offer any comfort.Corinne Le Quéré of the University of East Anglia said: “This is a really big fall, but at the same time 83% of global emissions are left, which shows how difficult it is to reduce emissions with changes in behaviour”.Emissions are expected to rise during the rest of the year as lockdowns ease, so the annual decline for 2020 is likely to be around 8%. This fall will be the largest since the second world war, nearly six times larger than the one that followed the 2009 global financial crisis, and will reduce emissions to their lowest level since 2010.Devon County Council yesterday published a discussion paper that claimed maintaining half these projected 2020 reductions for the next 30 years would be sufficient to achieve net zero carbon by 2050, saying “the lockdown has given a glimpse of how a more sustainable Devon might look, feel and sound”.A spokesperson said the report suggested that “the reduction in road transport and energy use has had an immediate and profound impact on emissions”.But University of Reading research shows that sustaining these same reduction levels indefinitely would only remove about 0.15°C of global heating, and that we would still massively overshoot Paris Agreement targets.Joeri Rogelj of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College said: “None of this is good news for anyone. For the climate, this month-long wake in otherwise record-high emissions is entirely insignificant.”"

"content" : "A decision to spend at least £3.9 million on Exeter’s Cathedral and Quay multi-storey car park was deferred by Exeter City Council’s Executive in April, but will be revisited at its June meeting.The city centre car park has been at risk of collapse since water leaked into the structure last winter. The four upper decks of the 355-space council-owned car park have been closed since January.Exeter Cathedral and Quay car park top deckA council report proposed spending £2.4 million to refurbish its lower floors, which remain open, and increase security measures for the whole building.The report also forecast expenditure of at least £1.5 million to repair the upper floors, but this was expected to increase because the cost of the repairs will not be known until investigatory work starts on site.However an Exeter City Council spokesperson said that the report had since been scrapped, and that revised proposals will be presented to the Executive at its June meeting.Exeter Cathedral and Quay car park subway entranceThe same meeting will also consider the Net Zero Exeter carbon reduction plan produced for the council by Exeter City Futures.One of the plan’s priority actions is to: “Make the city centre, and core walking areas, free from non-essential motorised vehicles to provide a vibrant public space and free up land currently used for driving and parking”.However the council is heavily dependent on car parking revenue, which has fallen precipitously during the coronavirus pandemic from £170,000 to £1000 a week.Exeter City Council car parksThe city also owns the nearby Mary Aches and Guildhall car parks, which together provide 827 public spaces, while twelve further city centre car parks, which the council says are located “within walking distance of all retail areas”, provide another 1520 public spaces (1736 at weekends).Another seventeen sites mean the city provides nearly 4,000 public spaces across 32 central car parks.In addition, National Car Parks and others provide around 1200 spaces, with Devon County Council’s on-street parking bays accounting for around 500 more and the city’s five park and ride sites another 1700 spaces, with more on the way.The county estimates that there are also around 3,000 off-street non-residential parking spaces in the city centre.Exeter Cathedral and Quay car park top deckThe 355 spaces the Cathedral and Quay car park would provide if its upper four decks were repaired and reopened would represent just 3.5% of the city’s 10,000 non-residential car parking spaces.How the city’s Executive can resolve the tension between spending such a significant sum on the Cathedral and Quay car park when it provides such a small proportion of the city’s car parking spaces, while the provision of city centre car parking is at odds with the council’s own carbon reduction plan, will hopefully become clear at its meeting on 2 June.Exeter City Council declined to comment on the content of the report or the revised proposals.It has since confirmed that the proposals have been “deferred for the foreseeable future”."

"content" : "In what may be an indication of development decisions to come, Exeter City Council planning committee approved plans for 40 new “zero carbon” homes on Monday night despite previously deferring the decision due to concerns about the development’s impact on congestion levels and the low proportion of affordable housing included in the scheme.The proposal to develop the 3.9 acre greenfield site between Pulling Road and Church Hill in Pinhoe initially included 100 car parking spaces, but a council report recommended a reduction to a total of 96 spaces, including two car ports and fourteen garages which Devon County Council, acting as local highway authority, does not count as parking spaces.Were the 12,000 homes envisaged as part of the “Liveable Exeter” development plan delivered with the same ratio of 2.4 car parking spaces per household an additional 28,800 cars would join the city’s roads.The Pulling Road proposal also initially included six affordable homes, just 15% of the total, but was amended to include six units for social rent and four for discounted market sale. Exeter City Council’s policy is that 35% of new developments should be affordable but the ten units included in the revised proposal amounted to only 25% of the total.However the council’s inability to demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites means that a presumption in favour of development applies. Following viability assessment which included consideration of the higher construction costs of high-tech energy efficient housing and the presumption that developers of such dwellings should expect a 20% gross profit margin, council officers recommended approval of the plans.Officers acknowledged that this form of development “results in a reduction in affordable housing provision” but said this was “an acceptable compromise which will result in both additional dwellings to meet the five year housing supply and a housing product which meets the overall aims of the council commitment toward being carbon neutral.”Pulling Road development site aerial photoCity councillors nevertheless questioned the plans, expressing surprise that the county highways authority had not objected in a consultation reply which included a transport assessment that predicted a vehicle arriving at or leaving the site every 75 seconds during peak times.A statement supporting the application said the new housing would generate “one vehicle trip every two minutes travelling in or out of the site on average”, a total of 720 movements a day which it described as “a minimal volume of vehicle flows”.But the county council simply requested a £130,000 contribution from the developer towards its Pinhoe area access strategy in response.Councillor Amal Ghusain said: “I don’t understand the logic behind highways allowing this to go ahead” and council leader Phil Bialyk said: “I don’t think it is satisfactory and will increase traffic quite a lot. I don’t get how highways have reached the decision that it is OK.”Local residents also expressed concern at the impact of increasing vehicle congestion in the area, identifying “tremendous pressure” on existing roads and at pinch points including Cheynegate Lane and the junction of Church Hill and Harrington Lane.Pulling Road development site location planLocal councillor Duncan Wood said Pinhoe had seen many developments which might not have had significant impact on traffic on their own, but which had aggregated to the point where traffic flow had increased significantly.He said: “This seems to be a development to be achieved at any cost, irrespective of whether it can be safely accessed or the traffic can be absorbed on a network already beyond capacity.”Fellow ward councillor Trish Oliver added: “We suffer from increasing traffic congestion and decreasing air quality and this will be exacerbated by all the other developments.”The adjacent Home Farm development of 120 houses is under construction, and 380 more homes are due alongside the proposal site at Pinhoe Quarry.But Rachel Sutton, city council portfolio holder for climate and culture, said that while the committee might disagree with the highways advice, there weren’t any reasons to refuse the scheme on such grounds.She said: “There is a lot to like about this. The quality of the houses is commendable and I like zero carbon homes as that is what we need. This is finely balanced but I am broadly in favour.”Councillor Keith Sparkes added: “We need the zero carbon homes in Exeter. Opposing on the traffic isn’t going to work, so this should go ahead.”Pulling Road development site planWhen the planning committee considered the application in February, Pinhoe councillor David Harvey pointed at the nearby bus service and cycle route and suggested the site was ripe for a car-free development.And the developer’s application statement said: “The site is surrounded by an excellent pedestrian and cycle network which links the site with the neighbouring employment and residential areas.“The city centre can be easily reached by cycle trips via a network of cycleways and advisory cycle routes.“There are seven bus stops located within a 450 metre radius of the site which support a total of five different bus services.”But Tom Carr, co-founder of developer Verto Homes, said making the site car-free would hinder sales.“When spending money on a property, people want to be able to store a car. As much as we want to push towards zero carbon, we cannot dictate how people live their lives.“We aim to build homes in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way. If Exeter is to lead the way and be carbon neutral, then supporting a zero carbon development is essential.”Pulling Road development design illustrationThe UK Green Building Council’s framework outlines what net zero carbon means in terms of building construction, operation and whole life emissions.It says that the production and construction of residential buildings accounts for more than half their carbon impacts, and that carbon offsets are necessary to mitigate both direct and indirect emissions from their development and use.And UK Advertising Standard Authority guidance requires that carbon reduction claims must be based on the full life cycle of products unless they state otherwise, and must make clear the limits of that life cycle.The developer’s application statement says that the development could be Exeter’s “first genuine zero carbon housing scheme”.But externalities such as emissions from motor vehicle journeys, remotely-generated electricity and the energy embedded in construction materials and their use all contribute to the overall impact of any development.The application statement does not mention these impacts nor whether they will be offset.And while infrastructure to enable the installation of electric vehicle charging points will be included in the development, there is no commitment to install charging points, nor any restriction on combustion engine-powered cars parking in the development’s 96 spaces.The developer’s agent described the suggestion by a planning committee member that the provision for charging points should be increased as an “over-specification”, partly because it would increase demand on the local electricity distribution grid.

As transport is Exeter’s largest source of carbon emissions, and vehicle congestion its bane, permitting developments which provide 2.4 car parking spaces for every household is neither compatible with the city’s vision for the future nor its carbon reduction plans.And if private property development profits necessarily make energy efficient housing unaffordable, the city faces many prospective decisions in which it will have to choose whether schemes such as this do more to help meet its overall aims than hinder them.As councillor Greg Sheldon said when the planning committee considered the Pulling Road application in February, with some houses expected to sell for more than £500,000: “It is no good saying we are getting zero carbon homes for the masses, if the masses can’t afford them.”The deferred planning decision was approved by nine votes to three, with one abstention."

"content" : "A night shelter that provides overnight accommodation for rough sleepers and homeless people in Exeter will now open all year round, following a planning decision by Exeter City Council.The shelter, which is located inside the Magdalen Street gyratory at the head of Western Way in a building that was previously a series of bars and restaurants, has been open during the winter months since November 2018.It will now also open from April to the end of September, when it will accommodate fourteen rough sleepers.Its capacity is 26 during the winter, which can be increased to 40 if the council’s Severe Weather Emergency Protocol is activated, which usually happens when the temperature is forecast to fall below zero for three consecutive nights.Dormitory style rooms on the first floor provide two or three sets of bunk beds per room, and a further eight beds are located on the ground floor.A report to a city council planning meeting on Monday 27 April said that as the building is already converted into a night shelter and community space for homeless people, year round use would make better use of the facility.A planning officer told the committee that opening the night shelter during the winter months would be of significant benefit to its users while only having a minor impact on the surrounding area.He also said it would reduce deprivation, contribute to social inclusion and support the homeless and rough sleepers.Two objections were received from local residents, expressing concerns about a potential increase of the noise and disturbance they had experienced during previous winter opening.In a written statement Nuala O’Farrell said: “There is a lot of noise and many public disturbances each week/month, with public intoxication, loud arguments, bad language and emergency services regularly on site.“These disturbances can be heard through closed windows and shutters/curtains. However the impact, whilst noticeable, is reduced as local residents spend most of their time inside during winter.“These issues will be magnified through the spring/summer months, with open doors and windows and residents trying to use their outside spaces.”Phil Bialyk, Exeter City Council leader, said that he didn’t dismiss her comments lightly but would support the recommendation to support homeless people in Exeter.Councillor Greg Sheldon added: “It would be more of a stain on the city if we didn’t provide somewhere like this as people would have to be sleeping on the streets.”The application to extend the shelter opening hours was approved. Conditions included the implementation of a revised management plan that requires the continuous presence of a minimum of two experienced staff on site during operating hours.The staff are trained to work with people with complex needs and to deal effectively with challenging incidents and behaviour, and have 24 hour access to an on-call manager for support and advice.However, speaking at the meeting Nuala O’Farrell said that the existing management plan for winter opening was not being followed, with police called out once or twice a week and only then for cases where disputes escalate and staff are unable to deal with them.Committee members said they recognised the issues raised and stressed the importance of strict adherence to the management plan, which is delivered via a partnership between Exeter City Council and Bournemouth Churches Housing Association, which also runs Gabriel House on Smythen Street.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            The shelter will now open from 6pm to 9am Monday to Friday and 6pm to 12pm on weekends and bank holidays from April to the end of September. The extended weekend hours are intended to cover a gap in provision at St Petrock’s homeless shelter, which does not open then.A spokesperson for the city council said: “In 2018/19 a total of 188 people used the night shelter, with over 50 moving on to more suitable accommodation, preventing them from further spells of homelessness and rough sleeping.“From October 2019 to the start of February, 100 people have accessed the night shelter.”The virtual planning meeting at which the decision was discussed on 27 April was adjourned due to a broadband outage, and subsequently reconvened on 4 May when the decision was confirmed."

It is anticipated that the majority building frontage will be placed to the west of the plot and at the back of the public footway to create an active street frontage, allowing direct access from Tillhouse Road for pedestrians.”The application is in outline form, so a further application for the detail and the design of the building will be required.East Devon District Council, the planning authority for Cranbrook, will determine the application at a later date.Presuming permission is granted, the building will be available for community use in 2021."

"content" : "Exeter City Council announced an anticipated £1.584m budget shortfall for April at Tuesday’s full council meeting.The meeting, which was held online, heard that revenues from car parking had fallen precipitously, down from a budgeted £170,000 to £1,000 a week.It was also told that council-owned visitor attractions and entertainment venues were closed and adverse effects on collection of council tax, business rates, commercial rates and other debts were expected.Council leader Phil Bialyk said: “The restrictions put in place to protect the public and NHS have had a significant impact on the council’s income.“The return sent to government last week estimated a total loss income of £315,000 for March and £1.584m for April.“There is a risk of losing an additional £681,000 in council tax and business rates in bad debts for April alone based on current payments compared to last year.”Exeter High Street under COVID-19 coronavirus lockdownThe council’s chief executive, Karime Hassan, had previously informed the council’s Executive that the £4.3 million held in the city’s general fund reserves at the end of 2019-20 would be depleted by the loss of income unless the government stepped in.He said: “Cash flow is an issue for us and we hope the government will do something quickly.”However Devon councils received only limited shares of the £1.6 billion emergency funding for local government announced on 19 March and the additional £1.6 billion announced on 18 April has not yet been allocated.Council leader Phil Bialyk said that the government had so far given the city £23,400 to support rough sleepers and £72,737 in general grants, but added: “The additional cost of emergency accommodation for rough sleepers has amounted to £193,000.“In total, it is estimated the council has spent an extra £238,000 in March and April above the amount provided by central government.“The extra £1.6 billion nationally is welcome but we don’t know how it will be allocated to councils. We are regarded as the last mile to deliver services but we cannot deliver if we are not funded.”Cathedral and Quay car parkThe council’s Executive deferred £6.357 million of capital spending at its meeting on 8 April in response to the loss of income.This included £3.9 million on repairs and refurbishment at the Cathedral and Quay car park, £2 million for an increase in Riverside leisure centre refurbishment costs and the lifecycle replacement cost of its roof and £250,000 to replace a roof at Exeter Corn Exchange.Council leader Phil Bialyk said the council has been told it will only receive additional funding for COVID-19, but that the loss of revenue in other areas meant the council’s financial viability could be in doubt.“We were already on a tight budget for this year so we face a big financial challenge. The lost income, lost commercial rents, loss of business rates and everything else: we will not get any of that back again.”Riverside leisure centre refurbishment worksRobert Jenrick, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, called council workers the “unsung heroes” of the coronavirus response and said would they have the resources they need.He said: “My priority is to make sure they are supported so they can continue to support their communities through this challenging time.“They are in the front line of the national effort to keep the public safe and deliver the services people need.“This new funding will support them through immediate pressures they are facing to respond to coronavirus and protect vital services.”"

Predicting what the future looks like in circumstances like these is impossible, and trying to do so is probably not good for your mental health either, so we urge you to take one day at a time and pay as much attention as you can to what matters in life, and not stay glued to your newsfeeds.We decided on Saturday to cancel next weekend’s social, and the Devon Carbon Plan and Net Zero Exeter workshops that were planned for the end of the month, on the grounds we should be doing everything we can to avoid accelerating community transmission. We’re glad to say government policy has since caught up with what seems to have emerged as widespread public opinion.We decided not to post this over the weekend as we didn’t want to interrupt everyone’s personal space while the gravity of the situation gradually became apparent, but we would now like to update you with our first thoughts about what the next few months might look like for Exeter Observer. Of course, there’s every likelihood that events will overtake us, but we’re nevertheless determined to continue developing the project.We were very saddened that we have had to cancel all the events we had planned. We’ve been tremendously encouraged by the talent, commitment and downright loveliness of the people who joined the course in January, and by everyone who would have started the course last weekend.We hope that we can get together again as a group when it is safe to do so, which we hope will be sometime during the summer. We shall see. In the meantime, we are committed to supporting all those who want to continue developing their research and writing skills by making use of online voice and video calling, and are happy to offer remote one-to-one tuition to anyone who would otherwise have started the course on Saturday.While many aspects of daily life will change dramatically during the coming months, most institutions and organisations that are of public interest will keep operating, albeit in rather unfamiliar ways, and there will continue to be plenty of important local news that needs reporting. If Exeter Observer was needed before these changes came, it will be needed during them, and afterwards too, only more so. Much of the work of producing and publishing takes place at home in any case.There are other workstreams that are essential to the development of the project which are also desk-based. These include extending our social media reach, improving the website in various ways and adding to the key topic notes so they become a go-to guide for content contributors. We’re also still working towards becoming a co-operative and raising share capital to launch a monthly print edition and start paying wages.And there are even tasks on the todo list that involve getting out and about in ways that are compatible with maintaining a safe social distance, such as creation of a stock photo pool.There’s more than enough to keep us busy for the foreseeable future. That is insofar as the future is foreseeable at all. And there seems to be plenty of scope to keep publishing stories for all those who want to write them. Although, of course, we appreciate that there are many other important priorities in circumstances such as these as well.So we’re flying flags which say we have set a course for the good ship Exeter Observer through the rough weather and everyone will always be welcome on board while we have steerage. After all: smooth seas do not skilful sailors make."

"content" : "Staff at the University of Exeter yesterday reached the end of a third week of industrial action over employment conditions.Strikers marched through the city centre before holding a rally at St David’s Church which included free teaching sessions and a performance by protest singer Billy Bragg.This round of industrial action began on 20 February with a two day strike, which was followed last week by a three day strike. This week’s four strike days are to be followed by five strike days next week.Academic staff were joined on the strike by support staff from across the university as pickets were held at Streatham and St Luke’s campus entrances. Nac Datta, a research information technology officer taking part, said it was “not just a lecturers strike”.Students have also been occupying university buildings in solidarity with the strikers.Billy Bragg playing at St David’s Church during Exeter UCU strike rallyThe current strike is the latest chapter in a dispute that has been going on for two years over pay and pensions, including equal pay for female and BAME staff, increasing workloads and the use of casual employment contracts.Last November an eight day strike was held in protest at the university’s extensive use of zero hours and short term contracts, a practice that is widespread in the sector, as well as pension scheme changes.The University of Exeter is the sixth most insecure employer in the Russell Group, and 23rd most insecure among 165 UK higher education institutions, with 64% of all academic staff employed on insecure contracts.And in March 2018 there was significant disruption on campuses across the country in response to pension scheme changes that affected 61 UK higher education institutions.University of Exeter UCU strike picket at Streatham campus. Photo: @SabinaLeonelli.The University &amp;amp; College Union (UCU) is striking over four issues: pay, employee workloads, use of casual contracts and pensions.Alongside a pay increase in line with inflation the union wants to close gender and ethnic pay gaps. While the median gender pay gap in the sector is 13.7%, the University of Exeter’s 2019 gender pay gap was 18.6%, more than double the national average of 8.9%.The union is also seeking the introduction of a 35 hour working week in their employment contracts.Dr Sharon Strawbridge, Exeter UCU President and senior lecturer in physics, said: “A typical lecturer will be contracted for 37 hours a week, and often works between 50 and 70 hours.“We have a system where the university’s bottom line is predicated on people working above and beyond their contracted hours.”To address this issue, the union embarked on “action short of a strike” in November last year, in which staff do not perform unpaid work outside their contracted hours, do not cover for absent colleagues, do not reschedule lectures or classes cancelled due to strike action and do not undertake any voluntary activities.Exeter UCU President Sharon Strawbridge speaking during Exeter UCU strike rallyCasualisation, or use of casual employment contracts, also became a UCU campaign focus last November.A 2019 survey found that part-time and hourly paid teaching staff perform 45% of their work without pay, while 71% of the survey’s respondents said that they believed their mental health had been damaged by working on insecure contracts.But it was changes to staff pensions that originally prompted the union to take action in 2018.UK universities invest in a sector-wide pension scheme, changes to which affect over 400,000 people.The changes at the centre of the dispute will increase pension contributions while reducing benefits, leaving a typical scheme member £240,000 worse off.University of Exeter UCU strike picket at St Luke’s campus. Photo: @lcpilling.University of Exeter students expressed mixed feelings about the latest round of strikes.A third year international law student who did not want to be named said: “Because of the strikes we missed out on an entire topic”, but also said he “sympathised with the staff 100%.”Simone, a second year English student said: “Everything of mine’s been cancelled” but that she was nevertheless attending the rally in support of the strike.Other students have been taking part in direct action in solidarity with the strikers, including camping on management car parking spaces for two nights in wintery conditions in February and again in March, saying they would vacate them if staff were to receive equal pay.The group also occupied a lecture theatre overnight.

"content" : "Exeter City Council declared a climate emergency on 23 July 2019, despite having rejected a proposal to do so just five months earlier.Nowhere in council minutes is there an absolute commitment to a date by when the city would be carbon neutral, but 2030 is the working assumption held by Exeter City Futures, the council’s chosen vehicle for mobilising the necessary changes.A 2030 target was also reinforced by the council leader, Phil Bialyk, during the 2020/21 budget debate on 25 February.

Although the pace of activity has recently quickened, Exeter City Futures has been around since 2015, initially as an offshoot of Oxygen House, an Exeter-based capital investment business, but today operating as a Community Interest Company.The company’s board consists of Glenn Woodcock (its founder) and representatives of the Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, University of Exeter, Exeter College and Devon County Council. The board is chaired by Exeter City Council’s chief executive and growth director, Karime Hassan. Its website contains a brief history of its development.The city council has so far contributed well over £300,000 in financial support for Exeter City Futures. Payback has not always been visible, but the 2030 target has led to a greater focus on what needs to be done to move to a carbon-neutral state.There are now twelve goals which Exeter City Futures says “reflect the shared priorities of the city”, a claim based on the “extensive engagement and listening activities” it has carried out over the past three years.The goals are grouped into four themes - energy, mobility, sustainability and capability - which serve as the framework for two recent publications intended to advance the action programme.The first of these, Exeter key facts 2019, is a compilation of indicators grouped under the four themes, plus some general information about population, employment, crime and so on.The objectivity of the booklet is undermined, presumably inadvertently, by the stark opening statement: “Exeter is no doubt a successful city”.This value judgement sits uncomfortably with a later statement that eight of Exeter’s priority areas (the twenty areas with the highest inequality levels) are among the top 20% most deprived areas in the country.That said, this is a welcome example of Exeter data being put in context, in this case a national comparison.However, all too often in this document figures are included without any temporal or spatial comparison.The bald fact that Greater Exeter consumes 10TWh of energy annually may mean something to someone, but without an explanation – for example whether it is typical of, higher or lower than the norm for similar settlements – it is meaningless to most of us.The second publication, Blueprint for a Carbon Neutral Exeter by 2030, has generated a degree of excitement almost on a par with the opening of IKEA Exeter in May 2018.According to Dr Liz O’Driscoll, managing director of Exeter City Futures, the document “sets out a specification for all the things that Exeter will need to have in place to be carbon neutral”.In comparison with many other cities going down this road it is particularly detailed, putting forward 89 specifications deemed essential to enable the stated aim.About twenty have quantifiable targets, others are specific about what the end result looks like.Apart from occasional whimsical ambition - “Exeter shall be named as a single-use plastic-free city” - the specifications are challenging and relevant, though occasionally sinister: “Exeter shall have developed systems which enable and manage behavioural change”.The document would have been more likely to win minds as well as hearts if more of the specifications were substantiated by evidence and, better still, such evidence had been used to indicate degrees of priority.For example, which steps would be relatively cheap, which would have the greatest impact on carbon emissions and which would be likely to meet popular resistance?In fairness, Exeter City Futures is not making excessive claims for the document. A recent tweet said: “Most of what is in our Blueprint for #NetZeroExeter is already known; but at the start of a major transformation it’s important that everyone is clear on the scale of the task we face together.”Exeter City Futures office in Broadwalk House, SouthernhayNot only is the task colossal, the crunch will come very soon according to the plans drawn up by Exeter City Futures and the council.On 26 March a Net Zero Exeter “Mobilisation Summit” will provide the opportunity for public input into how the Blueprint should be turned into an action plan that is described as a “roadmap”.Liz O’Driscoll told the council’s Strategic Scrutiny Committee on 16 January that she was committed to delivering the roadmap to the council’s chief executive by 31 March, just five days after the summit.Achieving the targets set out in the blueprint will require major changes. Some will be costly, some will require behaviour change, and our attitudes to growth and consumption will need shock treatment.Liz O’Driscoll told The Ecologist that the task is now “not about working out what to do, but working out what is standing in our way”.However significant issues remain unexamined. The relationship between the Exeter project and the county-wide climate emergency response being led by Devon County Council is not defined, and it is not clear whether the two initiatives will pursue independent pathways or converge.And many discussions that have informed both have taken place behind closed doors. Blueprint consultation meetings have been held with city councillors and business interests but attendance was by invitation only and their outputs have not so far been made public.The Devon Climate Emergency Response Group and its several sub-groups have been meeting without press or public present and the proposed Citizen’s Assembly has yet to convene, will be held in private and will not be able to decide what to discuss or who to call as witnesses when it does.At the opposite end of the openness spectrum, the Exeter group of the youth climate movement Fridays for Future is promoting a Green New Deal for Devon which recognises the integral importance of global social and economic justice.The Exeter City Futures blueprint does acknowledge some of the movement’s ambitions but, as reported by Exeter Observer, young people demonstrating at County Hall on 14 February were critical of it, if not always fairly.Exeter volume housebuilding at Hill Barton: energy efficiency standards will have to be much higher to meet blueprint specificationsExeter Observer asked the city’s opposition parties to comment on the blueprint, but only Exeter Green Party responded.A spokesperson said: “The final blueprint must clearly set out which and what combination of the many measures recommended will bring about the greatest reductions in carbon emissions in the shortest time and the investment required to achieve this.“And to ensure it doesn’t remain a wish list the Labour-led council must use all its powers to remove barriers and change systems which limit action.“In particular there is an urgent need to revise Exeter’s Local Plan so developers aren’t in the driving seat. We need a planning framework for housing and infrastructure that builds homes and communities able to sustain low carbon living.”At the same time, Exeter Labour Party support for Exeter City Futures reached new heights at the recent city council budget debate.Labour councillor after Labour councillor stood up to criticise the opposition Progressive Group, an alliance of Green Party, Independent and Liberal Democrat councillors, for submitting a budget amendment that would have reduced council funding to Exeter City Futures to instead pay for a full-time climate change officer who would be directly employed as council staff.Encounter Arts community engagement in Cathedral GreenMeanwhile, for the past fortnight, Exeter residents have been offered the chance to take part in “creative conversations” at various locations around the city where they were invited to share “thoughts, feelings and ideas” about the road to carbon neutral.These have taken place in a rather cramped converted van provided by Totnes-based arts organisation Encounters, the carbon emissions of which did not seem to feature in the discussion.One member of the public was deterred from entering by their assumption that the van was for children’s entertainment. The author did not find it at all conducive to serious consideration of system change.Those who did take part were invited to choose from a list of the 89 actions specified in the blueprint then write down their priorities on a cardboard disc to be fixed to a cork board.The author, being a shy person, would have welcomed more encouragement to engage in creative conversation from the Encounters staff.No doubt the value of the conversations that did take place will be revealed when the van has completed its rounds.Encounter Arts community engagement responsesThe purpose of real community engagement - as distinct from consultation - is to directly engage people in debate. Inviting people to determine carbon reduction priorities without providing any of the information necessary to make an informed choice is akin to inviting them to pin a tail on the donkey.True engagement involves discussion between many participants in which initial assumptions are challenged and refined in the light of additional information and debate.Whether the past four years of preparation have been worth it now depends on the outcome of the mobilisation summit in three weeks’ time on 26 March.Free tickets for the event, which will take place from 8.30am-5pm at St James Park, are available through Eventbrite."

"content" : "Around 200 people took part in Exeter’s Youth Strike 4 Climate on Friday 14 February, marking the first anniversary of regular protests against lack of action in the city to tackle the climate crisis.Young people across the world have participated in regular strikes since Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg staged a protest outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018 holding a sign that read: “School strike for the climate”.Students from local schools, colleges and the University of Exeter were joined by parents and other supporters on a march through the city centre to County Hall.The protestors formed a roadblock at the junction of Magdalen Street, South Street and Western Way, bringing traffic to a standstill for around five minutes.Some motorists reacted by honking, while others shouted in anger at the protestors, but most waited peaceably.When a fast-moving ambulance approached the crowd parted to let it pass unimpeded. The march then moved off along Holloway Street towards Topsham Road.When the march reached County Hall, the protestors formed a human chain around the buildings, linking hands in a long line that stretched from Topsham Road through the cloisters and round to Bellair House.Here young people addressed the crowd with the help of a sound system mounted on a bicycle trailer, speaking passionately about the climate crisis. The youngest was seven years old.The school strikers chose County Hall as their destination to highlight Devon County Council’s role as a key regional decision-maker, and the urgency and scale at which it must act to tackle the climate emergency that it declared twelve months ago.Earlier that morning, three hours before the march began, protestors had hung banners from Western Way footbridge which read: “More Buses. Less Traffic. Zero Carbon.”However, Exeter City Council employees arrived to remove the banners within minutes.Taylor, 14, said: “The banners were secured safely with zip-ties. As council workers took them down, I attempted to block their way.“But they said I would be arrested if I didn’t move.”The protestors pointed out that the council’s decision to remove the banners appeared at odds with Blueprint For A Carbon Neutral Exeter, a document which seeks to set out “all the things that Exeter will need to have in place to be carbon neutral”.The document is published by Exeter City Futures, the organisation asked by Exeter City Council to lead on the council’s commitment to making the city carbon neutral by 2030.It includes increasing bus passenger numbers, reducing congestion and removing non-essential motorised vehicles altogether from the city centre among its carbon reduction prescriptions.Diana Moore, Green Party councillor, who attended the protest, said: “We need people in positions of power to listen to young people.”However, the twenty page document only mentions young people once, proposing “to educate and engage young people in Exeter about the UN Sustainable Development Goals and their role in our city.”Youth striker Jess, 21, said: “The UN Sustainable Development Goals are problematic: they fail to address the fact that sustainability and development are mutually incompatible.“The goals focus on continued economic growth that relies on the old industrial model, with its ever-increasing consumption, production and extraction of natural resources.“This approach fails to address the inequalities that are at the heart of our social, economic and environmental problems. We cannot deal with the climate crisis this way.“The Exeter City Futures blueprint is insulting. It is all aspiration, no substance.”Exeter City Council did not reply to requests for comment on the arrest threat, the similarities between the banners hung on Western Way footbridge and statements in the Exeter City Futures blueprint, and the blueprint’s youth education proposals.A spokesperson for Exeter City Council said: “We agree with the premise of the protest and are currently in talks with the owners of the banners to find a suitable and safe location for their display.”The next Exeter Youth Strike 4 Climate will take place on Friday 13 March.Greta Thunberg is joining the school strike in Bristol today, where 25,000 people are expected to gather before bringing traffic to a standstill in parts of the city."

"content" : "Modern Exeter is built on the important Roman military settlement of Isca, where the 5,000-strong Second Augustan Legion were garrisoned for over twenty years. The civilian city developed around the fortress.Archaeological discoveries of Roman remains have formed a staple of Exeter’s recent history, including a major survey of Cathedral Close in the 1970s and the discovery of a Roman military supply base between Topsham and Exeter city centre in 2015.So it was not a great surprise to find yet more Roman remains during September 2019 construction work for the new leisure complex on the city’s bus station site.In a statement Exeter City Council joined in the delight of their specialist consultants, Cotswold Archaeology who also issued a news item on the find. But there is more to the story than this.Exeter bus station redevelopment site on which Roman remains were foundAccording to the council’s statement the find was “very important and completely unexpected”. The reports submitted as part of the outline planning application for the redevelopment in 2016 noted that there had been several surveys on the site in recent years, and concluded that this work “has identified no surviving remains of major significance on the site, and as a result there are no constraints in this respect on the principle or layout of the proposed development”.However version 18 of the project risk register dated 28 November 2017 – the only version available to Exeter Observer - identifies as risk 20 the possibility of finding buried structures on the site during construction. The possible impacts, categorised as high, are identified as delay and additional costs.The entry indicates that a site survey was carried out and issued, as a mitigation measure. The council subsequently stated that this survey did not identify the remains discovered in 2019 because it was “a simple site survey and did not excavate this far down or in this specific location”.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Exeter City Council responded to questions from Exeter Observer about the implications of the find for bus station redevelopment costs by stating that “no significant extra costs” were incurred; it declined to elaborate on the meaning of “significant”.At a full council meeting on 15 October 2019, council leader Phil Bialyk said that “the budget for the bus station and leisure complex included sums for anticipated archaeological works and the build plan included assumptions for archaeological works. At present there are no concerns regarding the critical path or the budget.”Again, he was not specific about the additional cost.Bampfylde Street car park beside the bus station redevelopment site, location of part of proposed CityPoint regeneration schemeHowever, former Green Party councillor Chris Musgrave recalls a degree of complacency at the civic centre about the risks of the work being disrupted by archaeological finds. He told us that when he was a councillor he attended a briefing about the revised plans for the bus station development.“The bids from developers came in much higher than the budget and many opposition councillors, myself included, wanted reassurance that costs were not going to continue to spiral.“Members were briefed by the then portfolio holder Phil Bialyk and key officers about how the new contract would be structured. Specifically, how costs would be kept down.“There was a range of cost-cutting measures but one in particular stood out. The council was proposing to sign a contract that had no contingency for the discovery of archaeologically significant remains.“Given Exeter’s history, I found this strange and asked what a worst-case scenario would cost ratepayers if anything of archaeological significance was found. Officers said that in a worst-case scenario the council would be liable for extra costs of ‘up to £5 million’.“Councillors were reassured, though, that this would not happen. The council was ‘confident’ the dig wouldn’t find anything significant under the bus station”.The council did not respond to an invitation to comment on Mr Musgrave’s statement. Bampfylde Street car park beside the bus station redevelopment site, location of part of proposed CityPoint regeneration schemeFollowing a request under the Freedom of Information Act, the council recently revealed that the cost of the disruption caused by the find was £56,608 (made up of three weeks overall delay, additional excavation, stockpiling and disposal of soil and plant hire) plus £8,290 for archaeological consultancy for the excavations.£65,000 may not seem “significant” to the council, but it would cover the cost of employing a middle manager for a year or, indeed, the annual running costs of the thirteen public toilets closed last year on the grounds the city could no longer afford them.The council initially refused to say whether there was a clause in the contract with Kier, the main contractor, covering a contingency sum in the event of significant disruption from archaeological work, citing commercial confidentiality, but subsequently had a welcome change of mind and confirmed that no such clause existed.This is consistent with what Chris Musgrave was previously told at the councillors’ briefing.CityPoint regeneration schemeThis time the council was lucky in the sense that the unexpected costs of archaeological work could be contained. However it may not be the end of the matter.In the January 2020 edition of the Devon Archaeological Society’s newsletter the city council’s heritage officer, Andrew Pye, wrote that the bus station site discoveries “belong to a new, and completely unknown, Roman military site”.He posits that there is much more to be discovered under the remainder of the site, under what was Bampfylde Street car park, and under Sidwell Street. The council announced in November 2018 that it hopes to see a major redevelopment of this area, which it later designated CityPoint.If the council manages to prise open this development opportunity, it cannot say it has not been warned about what lurks beneath."

"content" : "The green shoots of a net zero housing revolution are to be found on Chestnut Avenue, in Exeter’s Wonford housing estate, where six of the city’s 5000 council-owned homes have been chosen to pilot a new approach to transforming existing houses into energy efficient, low maintenance homes.The pilot has been developed by the city council in partnership with others including a company called Energiesprong UK. “Energiesprong”, which translates literally as “energy jump”, is the trade name of a commercial process for retrofitting existing houses to net zero carbon standards that is already well-established in the Netherlands.As the Energiesprong concept arrives in the UK, with projects for Nottingham and Exeter councils and a housing association in Essex, the pilot puts Exeter among the front-runners on the long march to a net zero carbon future.Retrofitting existing housing stock to eliminate the residential sector’s contribution to climate-changing carbon emissions is critical. The latest figures show that residential property accounts for 18% of the UK’s total CO2 emissions, a proportion that has risen steadily over the past ten years as the business and energy supply sectors have made more rapid progress in decarbonising.Averaged UK figures show that space heating is the dominant driver of energy consumption in existing homes, making up 63% of annual energy consumption, followed by hot water demand (17%) and appliance demand (13%).So, to meet Exeter City Council’s target of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2030, urgent action is required to transform the city’s 50,000 homes.The Chestnut Avenue pilot is both a demonstration of what retrofitting can achieve and, crucially, a source of learning to inform future investment decisions on a wider programme.The Energiesprong concept is simple enough. A new outer shell is placed over an existing house. All the parts are precision-made in a factory before being brought to the conversion site. Wall panels are manufactured with integrated windows and doors, and are pinned directly to the existing outer walls. Roof tiles are replaced by a lightweight covering on top of which solar panels are laid together like tiles to keep the rain out.The finished conversion requires no gas supply, and guarantees minimum temperatures and markedly reduced energy bills. The Green Alliance has produced a report which describes the process in more detail and assesses its potential.With an experienced contractor a single house can be converted in as little as a day. However, while the six Chestnut Avenue houses selected for the pilot are arranged in a row of three adjacent semi-detached buildings, and all in council ownership, the pioneering nature of the project, combined with December’s wet weather, meant it has taken nearer four months to convert them.Ian Hutchcroft from Energiesprong UK recently delivered a seductive sales pitch to a thinly attended meeting of the city council’s Strategic Scrutiny Committee. He said three key conditions need to be met for the industry to take off in the UK.First, a radical change in the purchaser-contractor relationship is required, from one in which the purchaser specifies a lot of detail to one where the purchaser specifies the outcomes to be achieved and leaves it to the supplier to decide how to achieve them.Second, a shift to lower energy costs for tenants, because they need to consume less energy, is needed to allow a higher proportion of total housing payments to go to the landlord, in this case the council, to build up capital for future retrofits.Third, the market for retrofits must become sufficiently large to encourage investment in the capacity to manufacture the parts needed for conversions at scale, thus reducing costs.The Chestnut Avenue retrofit is being carried out by Mi-space, an arm of the West Country-based Midas Group. But the project’s scale is tiny compared to the cost-efficient volumes needed to lower prices enough to persuade private sector landlords and owner occupiers, as well as councils and housing associations, to pay for conversions on a significant scale.The Dutch experience was that institutional landlords needed to club together to create a sufficiently large customer base to justify the investments in manufacturing that are required. In the UK co-operatives could also be established to help owner-occupiers and private landlords take advantage of such economies of scale.The principle is that the conversions pay for themselves through reduced energy and maintenance costs. But capital is needed upfront. Exeter has 50,000 houses of which only 10% are owned by the council. The city’s chief executive, Karime Hassan, tweeted after the scrutiny meeting that retrofit has the potential to help meet the city’s aim to be carbon neutral by 2030, but that scaling up from the pilot would be a challenge.It’s not only money that could hold back a programme like this. Owner-occupiers will need to decide whether they will stay in their homes long enough to benefit from the payback on the capital outlay, and older people may decide it’s not worth it.Will private sector landlords, who currently simply pass on energy costs to their tenants, consider conversions value for money? Will the UK’s profit-driven construction industry be prepared to take on new types of outcome-based contract requiring 30-year guarantees? Will the government be prepared to toughen up building regulations to force house builders to adopt Passivhaus or similar standards and apply them retrospectively over time?

The benefits of major retrofitting programmes appear substantial, not only in terms of meeting our carbon targets but also because they create badly-needed new jobs in the manufacturing and construction sectors to replace those displaced from climate-hostile industries.Whether Exeter adopts the Energiesprong model or something similar, the time available to convert the city’s existing housing stock is short. Council officers are enthusiastic about the Chestnut Avenue pilot, but they know that they, as well as councillors, will have to make hard-headed decisions on the way forward.Initial conclusions from the pilot project are expected by Easter 2020."

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s chief financial officer, Dave Hodgson, told a meeting of the council’s audit and governance committee on 4 December 2019 that the external auditors, Grant Thornton, had not yet provided their opinion on the council’s 2018/19 accounts even though the deadline for doing so was 31 July 2019.Without that opinion, the accounts could not be approved formally and then published, thus delaying public scrutiny of the council’s financial affairs.The delay also prevents the government from completing the national Whole of Government Accounts which give a comprehensive annual accounts-based picture of the financial position of the UK public sector. Insufficient staff resources at Grant Thornton was the cause.Mr Hodgson added that the delays by Grant Thornton meant that Exeter City Council finance staff were having to spend time on the previous year’s accounts when they should be concentrating on budget planning for the 2020/21 year, which starts in April.The council is also incurring extra costs by having to convene a special meeting of the audit and governance committee in January to approve the accounts.In addition, the situation had created a risk of damage to the council’s reputation because only the small minority of people familiar with the audit procedures would realise that the delay was caused by the external auditors and not by the council itself.The same issue has arisen on the other side of the M5 where East Devon District Council’s accounts were delayed by the same audit firm, Grant Thornton, though less severely than Exeter’s have been.Despite a report to the East Devon committee making clear that the auditor’s failure to meet the 31 July deadline was down to a “lack of [auditor] staff resources”, Grant Thornton added extra fees to their bill due to “delays caused by council staff availability delaying the start of our interim audit”. Unsurprisingly, the council challenged this.Similar problems have occurred across the country. More than 40% of audit opinions were not available by 31 July 2019, up from 13% the previous year, although it is important to note that some of these audits relate to police and fire authorities as well as councils.By 31 October 2019 the position had improved, though a quarter of audit opinions had still not been received:                        Appointed auditor            Delayed audit opinions at 31 July 2019            Delayed audit opinions at 31 October 2019                                    BDO            13            9                            Deloitte            18            15                            Ernst &amp;amp; Young            90            62                            Grant Thornton            70            25                            Mazars            17            8                            Total delayed            208            119                            Total commissioned            486            486            Source: Public Sector Audit Appointments LtdTo shed some light on how local government auditing reached this unhappy state, it is necessary to go back to the election of the Conservative-led coalition government in 2010.One of the Conservative Party’s priorities at the time was “Localism” which, in practice, meant removing as many elements of central control over local government as possible, provided doing so was consistent with retaining sufficient power in Whitehall to impose austerity-driven policies.One seemingly quick win was the decentralisation of the local government audit function, which had been controlled from the centre since 1983 by the Audit Commission. In ministers’ eyes, this scored well not just on localism, but also on increasing opportunities for private sector auditors in the local government market, on creating competition between firms to drive audit prices down and on making further expenditure savings by abolishing the commission and its overheads.The abolition announcement was made on 13 August 2010, a mere three months after the general election and while Parliament was still in summer recess. The new language of government was exemplified by the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles MP, who described the commission thus: “rather than being a watchdog that champions taxpayers’ interests, it has become the creature of the Whitehall state”.Although it took until 2014 to pass the legislation to shut down the commission, the development of arrangements to replace it proceeded in the meantime. Despite the validity of some prior criticism of the commission, many commentators considered what happened subsequently as a triumph of dogma over good planning and risk management.For anyone wanting an incisive analysis of the coalition’s local government auditing reforms, a recent paper commissioned by the House of Commons Housing Communities and Local Government Committee and written by Professor Laurence Ferry of Durham University makes some key points that illuminate Exeter City Council’s predicament.First, the Local Government Association set up an arms-length body, Public Sector Audit Appointments Ltd (PSAA), supposedly to help local government bodies appoint auditors. In practice PSAA rapidly became a near-monopoly supplier of auditors to local government, setting standard fees for each authority based on the work needed to deliver an audit opinion in line with agreed professional standards. 98% of local government auditors are now supplied through PSAA.Second, fee income from audits has fallen significantly, though some of this reflects prescribed reduced auditing activity, such as a move away from value-for-money studies. Professor Ferry’s report notes that the average standard fee across England fell from above £200,000 in 2010 to £60,000 by 2018. PSAA’s fee-setting process has had the following effects in Exeter and East Devon:                          Year            Exeter City Council            East Devon District Council                                    2015/16            £57,887            £50,821                            2016/17            £57,887            £50,821                            2017/18            £57,887            £50,821                            2018/19            £44,573            £39,132                            2019/20            £44,573            £39,132              Source: Public Sector Audit Appointments LtdThird, only two of the “Big Four” audit firms continue to deliver local government audits via PSAA: Deloitte and Ernst &amp;amp; Young. Of the others PWC has not bid for work while KPMG did so for 2018/19 but failed. Only three other firms are engaged in local government audits, which contrasts with nine private sector firms in the days of the Audit Commission.This scenario goes a long way to explaining why firms like Grant Thornton have struggled to complete their contracted work on time.The firm said in a statement: “There are significant pressures facing the auditing profession at the current time due to a combination of increased regulatory scrutiny, the challenges of recruiting and retaining staff across the country and the increasing complexity and quality of draft accounts.“Local government auditors are now working in a different and more challenging environment to 2017, when the last audit tenders were made, which is contributing to delivery challenges within all firms.“Exeter City Council published a statement on its website in July which outlined the impact of resourcing on the progression of the council’s audit. We are currently working with the council to conclude the audit in the next few weeks.”This is doubtless true. But as a member of Exeter City Council’s audit and governance committee pointed out, it does not explain why the audit firms continue to bid for work for which the fees, by their own admission, are now insufficient. Perhaps they are trying to build a track record that will stand them in good stead for whatever new audit regime comes next?For there will indeed be changes, given the extent of concern about the present arrangements. For example, the PSAA’s chief executive, Tony Crawley, summarised his views in a blog post in January 2019:“Whilst our contracts ensure that the firms are remunerated at the level of their bids, and the majority of S151 officers think the audit fee is now about right, we are conscious that there is a perception of a risk to audit quality resulting from the new prices.“There is no doubt that audit fees have reduced significantly, and typically are now 35% of their 2012 levels in absolute terms following successive reductions of 40%, 25% and for 2018/19 onwards, a further 23%.“Whilst a large chunk of the earlier reductions were down to eliminating Audit Commission central costs and changes to the work requirements, the reductions are now substantially due to our suppliers reducing their prices for delivering audits that meet the scope of the Code of Audit Practice requirements, including the auditing standards.”This followed Sir John Kingman’s 2018 review of the Financial Reporting Council which noted that the PSAA was focussed on the costs of audit,  concluding that “these arrangements, in practice, may well be prioritising a reduction in cost of audit, at the expense of audit quality”. And it preceded the July 2019 announcement of a review into the quality of local government audits, the final report from which is due in March 2020.So, apart from the presumably unintended consequences of disruption to local authority finance departments, how does the reform score against other expected benefits? Not too well is the answer.First, it had limited impact on Localism. The change removed the heavy hand of the Audit Commission, but has not given councils any meaningful new freedoms, given that almost all of them are saving time and effort by going through the PSAA appointments system.Second, it failed to create increased opportunities for private sector auditors in the local government market. As Professor Ferry points out: “The new audit regime has failed to increase audit market competition for local government, which now has actually fewer suppliers including fewer Big Four firms, than prior to the reforms.“There are now only five firms providing public audit services to local government, rather than ten under the Audit Commission regime (including its own District Audit Service). The situation is arguably an oligopoly.”Third, the aim of creating competition between firms to drive down audit prices was achieved, but by other means. Some have withdrawn from the market, as the reform was always going to be a tough sell to firms who live or die by fee earnings, and it has been PSAA rather than competition that has driven fees down.Nevertheless, some expenditure savings were made by abolishing the Audit Commission and its overheads, as noted by Tony Crawley above.

However, the government’s August 2010 announcement had little to say about audit quality other than that the changes would “maintain auditing standards”. The evidence suggests that even this modest ambition has not been achieved.Audit firms are not charities. If a piece of fee-earning business is not going to show a profit in the long run, these firms will either make savings by cutting the amount of work done or by handing it over to more junior and less experienced, which is to say cheaper, staff.Meanwhile, back in Exeter, Dave Hodgson has been left to find staff time both to finish the audit and to make financial plans for 2020/21."

"content" : "Apart from Devon East, where independent candidate Claire Wright was well-positioned to challenge 150 years of Conservative representation at Westminster, few people expected any of Devon’s twelve parliamentary constituencies to change hands at this election.As predicted, a sea of blue still surrounds Exeter and Plymouth Sutton &amp;amp; Devonport, both of which Labour held with reduced majorities.The only South West seat that changed hands was Stroud, which has been marginal since 1997. Labour lost 5% of its vote share, while the Green Party increased its vote share by the same amount, turning a Labour majority of 687 into a Conservative majority of 3,840.The only South West MPs outside Devon that are now not Conservative are the four in Bristol, all of whom held their seats for Labour, and Bath’s Liberal Democrat, who bucked the national trend to increase her majority mostly at her Conservative rival’s expense.But the surge of support that produced extraordinary results for the Conservatives in other parts of the country was not replicated across Devon, with some candidates losing vote share on 2017’s results and others only managing to increase theirs by a couple of percentage points.``In East Devon, where Independents won 31 district council seats in May, up 18, to take control of the local authority from the Conservatives for the first time in its 45 year history, Claire Wright was expected to do well against newcomer Simon Jupp, having increased her vote share from 24% in 2015, the first time she stood in the seat, to 35% in 2017.Her grassroots campaign generated widespread support and interest, with hundreds of posters and banners visible across the constituency and national media attention reflecting its prominence.However, despite the exit poll prediction that she had a 96% chance of winning, a high turnout of 74% and her vote share increasing to over 40%, Simon Jupp ended the night with a reduced Conservative majority of 6708 on a share of nearly 51%.Before the ballot there had been criticism of the Greens and Liberal Democrats for failing to stand down in favour of Unite to Remain proposals to back Claire Wright as the constituency’s strongest remain candidate, but the count revealed that so few votes were cast for the other four candidates that put together they still fell short of the winning margin.Labour’s vote share notably fell by nearly 7%, leaving all four unable to reclaim their deposits.Exeter’s May local elections had seen new Liberal Democrat, Green and Independent councillors elected, although Labour retained 29 of 39 seats on the city council, and an October county council byelection had resulted in a collapse of support for Labour in Heavitree &amp;amp; Whipton Barton where the Green and Liberal Democrat vote shares both increased by more than 11%.However Labour incumbent Ben Bradshaw, who has held the seat since the 1997 Labour landslide, was defending a large majority of 16,000 having increased his vote share by 16% in 2017 and so was expected to win comfortably.In the event a 9% vote share loss saw his majority reduced to just over 10,000 on a turnout of 68%, down 3% from 2017.The Conservative party’s vote share increased by nearly 2%, but Green Party candidate Joe Levy notably increased his vote share by nearly 7% to nearly 9% of the ballots cast, supported by 5,000 voters.The Liberal Democrat candidate stood down in the constituency, which no longer includes St Loyes or Topsham since their 2010 transfer to Devon East, as part of the Unite to Remain campaign pact.Luke Pollard did rather better for Labour in the party’s other Devon seat, Plymouth Sutton &amp;amp; Devonport, where he won with 2,000 fewer votes than in 2017 on a share that shrunk by 5%. The turnout of 68% was up by a point and a half.He had taken the seat in 2017 with 13% of the vote and a majority of 7,000 but now has the smallest majority among Devon MPs, making his constituency the most marginal in the county.He nevertheless successfully saw off the Conservative candidate Rebecca Smith, whose vote share was 1.1% lower than her predecessor’s. Ann Widdecombe came third for the Brexit Party with sufficient vote share to avoid losing her deposit, but too few votes to have handed victory to the Conservatives had pro-Brexit support not been split.Conservative Neil Parish also lost 1.1% of the vote share in Tiverton &amp;amp; Honiton, which covers half of East Devon district and half of Mid Devon district, in both of which Independents did well in the May local elections.He nevertheless increased his majority to 24,000 to comfortably hold the seat with 60% of the ballots cast on an unchanged 72% turnout.Labour’s vote share fell by 8%, most of which apparently went to the Liberal Democrats who nevertheless still finished third.The Conservative candidate in Totnes, Anthony Mangnall, who was selected to run against previous incumbent Sarah Wollaston after she resigned from the party in February, also saw his party’s vote share shrink slightly compared with 2017.He nevertheless comfortably held the seat, which covers the eastern half of South Hams and parts of Torbay, with 53% of the votes giving him a majority of nearly 13,000 on a 75% turnout, up nearly 2%.Sarah Wollaston had joined the Liberal Democrats in August after co-founding The Independent Group for Change in parliament.Despite benefiting from the Unite to Remain electoral pact and increasing the Liberal Democrat vote share by 16% to nearly 29%, her defection has cost her a place in parliament, where she previously played a prominent role as chair of the health select and liaison committees.Labour’s Totnes vote share fell by 10% to under 9,000, the biggest drop in the county.Anne Marie Morris, who had been suspended from the Conservative Party between July and December 2017 for making a racist remark at a Brexit report launch event, comfortably held the Newton Abbot constituency. Her vote share was unchanged at 55%, giving her a majority of 29,000 on a slightly increased 73% turnout.Liberal Democrat success at the local elections in May, when the party nearly doubled its seats on Teignbridge District Council to take control from the Conservatives, was not replicated at the general election. The party’s modestly increased vote share of 22% was, however, enough to push Labour into third place.Mel Stride’s performance in Devon Central was slightly better, increasing his vote share by a little over 1% on a high 77% turnout to give him a majority of nearly 18,000. The Labour vote share only fell by 2% here, leaving the party in second place well clear of the Liberal Democrats.The constituency, which covers parts of East Devon, Mid Devon, West Devon and Teignbridge districts as well as Dartmoor, is the third largest in the country. It is the only one without a conurbation with a population of more than 10,000: Bovey Tracey, Okephampton and Crediton all have fewer than 8,000 residents.Devon parliamentary constituency and district council boundaries. Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2019.Devon South West has been held for the Conservatives since 1997 by Gary Streeter, who was previously MP for nearby Plymouth Sutton before its absorption into what is now Luke Pollard’s seat in 2010.He is a prominent Christian MP who has chaired Christians in Parliament for over a decade and has controversially attempted to overturn an Advertising Standards Authority ban on faith healing claims.His vote share increased by 2.5% to give him a 21,000 majority with 62% of the vote, 6,000 larger than in 2017. Turnout was slightly down at 74%.Labour support fell by 8% while Liberal Democrat vote share increased by 7%, but Labour retained second place with a 22% share, twice that of the Liberal Democrats.Geoffrey Cox has held neighbouring Devon West &amp;amp; Torridge since he overturned a small Liberal Democracy majority in 2005.He was appointed Attorney General by Theresa May in 2018, subsequently placing him at the centre of the prorogation controversy that saw Parliament unlawfully suspended in September.His vote share increased by 3.6%, largely at the Labour candidate’s expense, to give him a majority of nearly 25,000 on a 75% turnout, up 1%. As a result Labour fell to third place behind the Liberal Democrats.Devon West &amp;amp; Torridge is the largest constituency in the country by area, covering all of Torridge and most of West Devon districts. Okehampton, which had previously been in the seat, was transferred to Central Devon in 2010.Kevin Foster performed better for the Conservatives in the Torbay constituency, which covers most, but not all, of the unitary authority area of the same name, Brixham being part of the neighbouring Totnes constituency.His vote share increased by over 6% on a turnout matching the UK average of 67%, giving him an increased majority of nearly 18,000. The Liberal Democrats came second, as they have since 2015 after previously holding the seat from 1997.Johnny Mercer held Plymouth Moor View more emphatically for the Conservatives, increasing his vote share by nearly 9% at the Labour Party’s expense and more than doubling his majority to nearly 13,000 on a turnout of 64%, down 2%.He controversially took a second job in 2018 which paid £85,000 for 20 hours’ work a month, equivalent to £350 per hour, and has been challenged several times over his campaign and parliamentary expenses.He was appointed as a junior defence minister earlier this year and sits on the Health and Social Care Select Committee.

The Devon Conservative vote share increased most of all in Devon North, the only constituency in the county to coincide with its namesake district, despite the Conservatives losing control of the council in May to the Liberal Democrats.Newcomer Selaine Saxby, who was elected as a district councillor in May, saw the Conservative vote share rise by nearly 11% to boost the party’s majority to 15,000 on an unchanged 73% turnout.The Liberal Democrats have historically performed well in this seat: it was held for their Liberal predecessors by party leader Jeremy Thorpe from 1959 to 1979 and again by Nick Harvey from 1992 to 2015, so the loss of 8% of the vote share and the scale of the Conservative victory is all the more remarkable.Selaine Saxby is the first female MP to represent the constituency and one of only two women representing the county in Parliament. 220 female MPs have been elected, 12 more than the previous peak in 2017, but they still only constitute just over a third of the House of Commons.Meanwhile Electoral Reform Society analysis of results across the country has revealed that while the 865,000 people who voted for the Green Party will be represented by a single MP, each of the SNP’s 48 Westminster MPs only needed 26,000 votes to take a seat in Parliament.At the same time 45.3% of votes were cast for losing candidates, so none of those votes will be represented in Parliament at all."

"content" : "Political hacks have become more of a nuisance than ice cream-snaffling seagulls on Exmouth sea front in recent weeks as national media coverage of Claire Wright’s campaign to unseat the Tories in East Devon has increased by the day.Reporters who hadn’t already realised East Devon would be a 2019 general election hotspot began to notice the game was afoot when incumbent Hugo Swire announced in September that he would not stand.Then last week’s MRP YouGov poll found that Claire Wright was the most likely Independent to be elected in Britain, and pundits of every stripe woke up to the prospect of the first ever parliamentary victory for an independent candidate that has faced competition from all the main parties.Projected East Devon vote share in 2019 general election. Source: @timburley.Claire Wright, who has never been a member of a political party, has been blazing a trail for independents since her election to Ottery St Mary Town Council in 2009.Two years later she ousted the long-standing leader of East Devon District Council, then won the biggest majority on Devon County Council in 2013, and then again in 2017, with a thumping 75% vote share.In her first parliamentary election in 2015 she won 24% of the votes cast from a standing start, then increased her share to more than 35% in 2017.And since the surge of support for independents across the region in the May local elections, a new kind of politics has begun to look unstoppable in this part of the world. Independents won 31 seats in East Devon, up 18, to take control of the district from the Conservatives who had run the council for its entire 45 year history.Claire Wright said: “I’ve always been an Independent. I’ve always been elected because of my hard work and the way I stand up for people, not because of the party I’m from.“I’m a hard-working and effective councillor and will be a hard-working and effective MP. I’ve worked cross-party for the last ten years to achieve a range of things and I’d do exactly the same if I was in Parliament.“It’s a complete myth that you need a party around you in the Commons. You don’t. It’s all about the person. The Green Party’s Caroline Lucas is probably one of the best known and effective MPs in the country.”East Devon election results in 2015 and 2017With such strong support for independent politics in East Devon, and Hugo Swire’s withdrawal confirmed, the 7 November Unite to Remain tactical voting pact announcement came as a shock to many local observers. Instead of the LibDems and Greens standing down in the constituency to make way for the only candidate who is both pro-Remain and capable of beating the Conservatives, they would both contest the seat.Since then a row has been brewing in the region around the role of national political parties in choosing whether to stand candidates when local party activists may have other preferences based on insights from grassroots campaigning in their constituencies.Unlike neighbouring Exeter, where unambiguously pro-Remain Labour incumbent Ben Bradshaw’s 16,000 majority is unlikely to be overturned whoever stands against him, other Remain-supporting parties giving way to the strongest challenger to the incumbent Tory presents the best chance of sending a Remain-supporting East Devon MP to Westminster.Indeed, on 11 November Unite to Remain’s director Peter Dunphy confirmed that the campaign had sought a deal to support Claire Wright in East Devon, but had been unable to persuade the Green Party or Liberal Democrat leadership that they should stand aside.He said: “We were unable to gain Unite to Remain all-party agreement in East Devon where we had proposed Claire Wright as the clear challenger to the Conservatives.“Our suggestion therefore is to support the Remain candidate with the best chance of victory, which in the case of East Devon is the Independent Claire Wright.”All five pro-Remain tactical voting campaigns recommend supporting her too.East Devon Independent Claire WrightBut LibDem candidate Eleanor Rylance is clear that her local party had no idea a Unite to Remain deal was being negotiated for East Devon and was never consulted over the proposals.She said: “We were liaising with HQ for months and months and they assured us that East Devon was of no interest”.Stuart Mole, the local party’s press officer, concurred: “At no time has it been proposed to local Liberals - by the Liberal Democrats, by Unite to Remain or indeed by Claire Wright - that the agreement should be extended to East Devon. Nor, to our knowledge, has the local Green Party been approached.”However, a week passed after the Unite to Remain announcement during which other candidates could have chosen to withdraw from the ballot in support of Claire Wright.Eleanor Rylance says she did not consider doing so, saying she did not know that Claire Wright was unambiguously pro-Remain or that she would vote to revoke Article 50 if faced with a no deal Brexit.Eleanor Rylance speaking at hustings at Exmouth Community CollegeIn fact Claire Wright’s campaign literature clearly states her position: “The government should offer the people a democratic say on the agreement by way of a confirmatory vote and I would campaign to remain. I would vote to revoke Article 50 if we were faced with the imminent danger of a no deal Brexit.”Eleanor Rylance said: “All I have is her manifesto commitment which is that she’ll back remain in a referendum. We think it’s in the public interest for people to be able to vote to revoke Article 50. Our position is that if Claire is a good candidate then people will vote for her no matter what.”Stuart Mole added: “It is important that all who wish to vote Lib Dem should have the chance to do so. Eleanor Rylance was unanimously reaffirmed as our candidate for parliament in East Devon last month and we have high hopes of her doing very well.”However the party’s prospects in the constituency look poor. The previous candidate lost her deposit in the 2017 election, polling just 1,468 votes on a 4.4% swing against the party after the 24.4% swing it suffered in 2015 at the end of the coalition term.When asked how she would react if Claire Wright fell short of winning by a margin equal to the votes cast for herself, thus handing victory to a Brexit-supporting Tory, Eleanor Rylance said: “This is going to be an extraordinarily complicated election and there are going to be lots of people switching sides.“There’s absolutely no way of telling where votes will have come from.”Henry Gent speaking at hustings at Exmouth Community CollegeEast Devon Green Party was also kept in the dark about the prospect of a Unite to Remain deal in the constituency. Its candidate Henry Gent said it “was not consulted at all.”However, he went on to say that he thought the local party “would not have expected to be consulted”, as the Unite to Remain agreement that emerged “does not include standing down against an Independent in any constituency”.But members of the local party are aggrieved that they were not consulted over whether to stand a candidate, especially given the unique circumstances in East Devon.Olly Davey, East Devon Green Party co-ordinator, acknowledged that the party had received complaints from members about the decision.He said: “We have had a number of responses expressing the view that we should not be standing against Claire Wright.“We did not ballot members [to ask whether a general election candidate should stand] though this was discussed at length by the committee and other members.”When asked how many had complained, he said: “I have not kept a list, but I think it is about a dozen.”Local member Mark Gold said: “I’ve been a Green Party member for many years, but there’s no doubt that we should not be fielding a candidate to oppose Claire Wright in the election.“All the national newspapers seems to agree that she has a real chance of winning and considering her support for environmental protection and her great record in helping local people as a councillor, we should all be voting for her.“Indeed, that’s exactly what all the Green Party members I know will be doing on December 12th. And given that, I find it hard to understand how the awful decision to field a candidate was reached.”St Loyes and Topsham have been in the East Devon constituency since 2010 boundary changes. Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2019.Emily McIvor, who was co-ordinator of East Devon Green Party from 2013 to 2015, said: “Members were not asked whether East Devon Green Party should field a candidate despite East Devon being such a special case.“Internal party democracy is a core value for Greens, and members who feel a candidate has been imposed upon them have good reason to feel let down.”Olly Davey confirmed that the Green Party constitution confers autonomy on local parties, within party rules, but added: “There is no requirement on local parties to ballot their members on whether to stand in elections.”He said: “All the communications we were receiving from the Green Party were urging us to get on with selecting our candidates so that if an election was called, we had candidates in place”, adding “even if it were subsequently decided to stand aside.”However he later said that he and the local returning officer, Pete Duke, had also been advised by the party that “it would be a breach of party rules to ballot members on standing once we had started the selection process.”Sue Nicholson, who was a Green Party district councillor in Stroud for eight years after becoming the UK’s first female Green councillor in 1988, moved to East Devon 18 months ago.She said: “When I heard the Greens were going to stand somebody here I was horrified. I’m really sorry and disappointed we’re standing a candidate here because I don’t think it’s appropriate in the circumstances.“I would have preferred the members to have been balloted on whether we should stand a candidate or not, which didn’t happen.”Claire Wright speaking at hustings at Exmouth Community CollegeLocal members have also criticised the way East Devon Green Party selected Henry Gent as its candidate, although co-ordinator Olly Davey claims no-one has complained to him about the selection method.Voting invitations were sent out using SurveyMonkey, which he acknowledged “is not totally secure”, instead of Opavote, a specialist online voting platform which a South West Green Party elections official advised him “would have been a better system to use”.In the voting invitation email Olly Davey acknowledged that he had mistakenly sent a previous poll link, which had since closed, to “many more people than intended”.However, the replacement poll link was nevertheless sent not only to party members who live in East Devon, but also to those who live in the neighbouring Tiverton and Honiton constituency, alongside a request to the latter group not to vote.As a consequence, Olly Davey admitted that the party could not be absolutely certain that no non-members voted in the candidate selection process.However, he added: “I have no reason to believe that any non-East Devon Green Party members voted, and I would trust our members not to indulge in practices they know are fraudulent.“There was only one candidate for selection, plus the option of re-open nominations, and I would be more suspicious if we had received a deluge of votes for the latter option, or indeed for the candidate. 45 members voted to select Henry, with 5 voting to re-open nominations.”Sharon Howe, a local member who helped restart East Devon Green Party in 2010 after a hiatus, said: “There should have been a vote on whether someone should stand at all, rather than only being asked whether we wanted to vote for Henry Gent. The members should have been canvassed first but we weren’t asked.“I’m unhappy about that, and I’m unhappy that the SurveyMonkey poll was not secure and could have resulted in fraudulent voting. The situation made me very angry.“I wrote to Olly Davey about it, and had the impression that a lot of other people complained as I did, but he just tried to defend the decision and didn’t really take my arguments on board.“It seemed like the decision had been made higher up in the party. I got the feeling the local party was putting up a wall against the objections.”Hustings at Exmouth Community CollegeHenry Gent also defended the process that led to his selection as party candidate. He said: “The regional party confirmed that our selection process was sufficiently rigorous. We held a well-publicised open meeting for all members as a hustings prior to the vote. The vote was overwhelmingly in my favour. There is no evidence that any non-members managed to vote.”He also said that the Green Party should be on the ballot paper so people can give the clearest possible indication of where they stand on the climate emergency.Somewhat surprisingly, given that he is standing against her, he added that he would be delighted if Claire Wright were to win.Emily McIvor said: “Every East Devon Green Party member I’ve spoken with shares that view, which is hardly surprising given that Claire has always championed green causes and actively opposed cuts to vital local services.“Green voters across the UK in every other constituency can vote with pride, knowing they’re backing urgent action to address climate change and oppose Brexit. But East Devon is different.”Exeter and East Devon constituency boundaries. Contains OS data © Crown copyright and database right 2019.Indeed, as with the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party’s prospects look poor in the constituency. In 2010 its candidate received just 815 votes, losing the party’s deposit. No candidate came forward to stand against Claire Wright in 2015 or 2017, with some local members already choosing to vote tactically in her support.And if the 2017 turnout were to be repeated this year, Henry Gent would need to receive at least 3020 votes to avoid losing the deposit again.When asked how he would react if Claire Wright fell short of winning by a margin equal to the votes cast for himself, he said: “In the event that there is a majority government for either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn the result for East Devon will not make any difference.”“In the event of a minority government, I hope that the next general election is not far away.”“So, in the very unlikely event that Claire Wright loses by that margin, my reaction will be phlegmatic.”“On balance, the result might do some good in forcing a genuine progressive alliance in East Devon involving all the progressive parties rather than just expecting the Greens to unilaterally stand down.”Claire Wright speaking at a rally in ExeterOther local party members were more positive about the potential of tactical voting in the constituency at this election.Sue Nicholson said: “I was a member of the Ecology Party before the Green Party, and have campaigned for the Greens and voted Green at every opportunity I have had throughout my life.“I’ve never voted tactically before, but on this particular occasion I’m going to vote tactically for Claire Wright.“It was a tough decision to make because this is a complete departure for me, but it was just so important for me to do everything we can to avoid getting a Tory MP here in East Devon.“This election is not like any other. The Tories will do so much damage to our economy, to the environment, to the social fabric of our society.“In future elections, certainly in local elections, I will almost certainly vote Green: it is the habit of a lifetime.“However I can wholeheartedly support Claire Wright now because she’s an Independent with established green credentials and policies, and because voting tactically for the LibDems or Labour in East Devon is not an option as neither have a hope of ousting the Tories here.“If Claire Wright were elected she would be able to work very well with Caroline Lucas, who will hopefully get in again, and any other Green MPs that might be elected.“On this occasion, in this constituency, at this election, the best vote for a Green Party supporter like me is a vote for Claire Wright.”2017 East Devon general election resultsIndeed, local activists from both LibDem and Green camps are choosing to campaign for Claire Wright instead of their own party candidates.Claire Wright said: “I have never asked for any favours from my rivals and I respect their decision to stand and fight for the seat.“Of course, running as a sole candidate against the Conservatives would appear to give me a better chance but I am not asking anyone for an easy ride.“I have fought a fair and positive campaign twice, increasing my share of the vote. I would now urge my supporters to concentrate all of their energy on getting this people-powered campaign over the line.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            And it looks like the Tories are worried, with both Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock visiting the constituency in recent weeks, and the party distributing a fake newspaper called East Devon Future in what Claire Wright called “a clear attempt to deceive voters.”At the same time, their candidate Simon Jupp has pulled out of an election hustings due to take place in Sidmouth on Friday.Meanwhile, persons unknown have set fire to election placards supporting Claire Wright in front of her parents’ home, and have ripped down boards elsewhere.The arsonists left a nearby board supporting the Conservatives untouched.A full list of candidates standing in the constituency is available via Democratic Dashboard."

"content" : "Staff at the University of Exeter were among more than 40,000 lecturers and other academic and support staff who walked out on strike at 60 UK universities on Monday in protest over pay cuts, increased pension costs and deteriorating working conditions.Members of the University and College Union (UCU) began eight days of strike action after agreement could not be reached with university representatives over ongoing disputes which caused significant disruption on campuses across the country during last year’s strikes.The UCU said it feared that universities had learnt nothing from last year’s dispute, accusing them of “playing games” after their representatives ruled out discussing pay and failed to make a serious offer at recent talks over changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme.The changes will increase pension contributions while reducing benefits, leaving a typical scheme member £240,000 worse off.At the same time the University of Exeter is the sixth most insecure employer in the Russell Group, and 23rd most insecure among 165 UK higher education institutions, with 64% of all academic staff employed on insecure contracts.Striking history lecturers Dr Jennifer Farrell and Dr Gemma Clark. Photo: @dr_j_farrell.A post-doctoral scientist at the University of Exeter College of Medicine and Health said: “University spending on staff has fallen to record lows in the last ten years, despite student numbers increasing. This has resulted in massive workloads and pressures, despite real-term pay falling.“We feel passionately about our research and our students, and demand to be treated fairly with respect, not given precarious or zero-hours contracts and a worse pension.”Another St Luke’s academic added: “Overall pay has declined in real terms, but this hits women and minority groups the most due to the pay gap, which compounds the effect. As a non-UK citizen my position is even more precarious, as when my temporary contract ends, I only have two weeks before I have to leave the country.“Casualised and temporary contracts mean my position is very insecure: I’ve had six contracts in the last five years and done teaching for free. There needs to be action on this!”University of Exeter UCU strike picket at Streatham campus. Photo: @SabinaLeonelli.Strikers emphasised that those affected included not only lecturers, but also researchers, librarians and many other professional services staff.A university librarian said: “Ever since the significant reduction in staff numbers, combined with increasing student numbers, library staff are especially stretched and overworked. It is actually written in to the strategic goals of the department to minimise staff spend, which makes working conditions really difficult.“Lots of professional services staff are on low pay grades compared to their workload, in addition to the use of precarious contacts and threats of redundancies.”A post-doctoral researcher added: “It is frustrating to be on strike over pensions again, but I feel even more strongly about the way that the university treats staff who are on casual contracts and those who are precariously employed.”University of Exeter UCU strike student supporters. Photo: @martinredfern.UCU South West regional official, Nick Varney, said: “Strike action is a last resort, but universities’ refusal to deal with these key issues have left us with no alternative. It is staggering and insulting that universities have not done more to work with us to try and find a way to resolve these disputes.“We hope students will continue to put pressure on university vice-chancellors to get their representatives back round the negotiating table for serious talks with the union.”Last month UCU members backed strike action across the UK. 83% of University of Exeter UCU members polled voted for strikes over changes to pensions and 77% backed strikes over pay and conditions.University of Exeter UCU strike picket at St Luke’s campus. Photo: @lcpilling.A University of Exeter spokesperson said: “We know that strike action may be unsettling for many of our students, and we remain hopeful that the dispute will be resolved at a national level. We are working to mitigate the potential impact of industrial action and ensure any measures we put in place are the right ones for students and staff.”Strikers at Streatham campus commented that university Vice-Chancellor Steve Smith’s pay appeared to reflect other priorities. He is due to receive £830,000 next year, the largest ever package in the sector.The strikes will continue to Wednesday 4 December. Union members are also taking “action short of a strike” which includes working strictly to contract, not covering for absent colleagues and refusing to reschedule lectures lost to strike action.There will also be a free teach-out from 12-4pm at St David’s Church this Friday 29 November facilitated by striking University of Exeter staff and student supporters."

"content" : "Exeter’s G bus service runs between Polsloe and the quay via the city centre. Passenger numbers are not high, the main users being residents of the Polsloe area and the Shillhay estate by the river. Operating the service is not a viable commercial proposition, so it is provided under a contract subsidised by Devon County Council.In May 2019 Country Bus replaced Stagecoach as the G service operator following a competitive tendering exercise. Information from the county council shows that there were two bidders, that Country Bus won on price and that the service is now costing the taxpayer £21,950 per year.The service seems to run reliably and to time. Country Bus uses a minibus to provide the service, as did Stagecoach, although the author’s personal experience suggests that the seats are now harder than they were. The timetable remains the same: six trips at hourly intervals each way between 09:30 and 15:30.Many passengers know each other, evoking a sense of local community more commonly found on rural buses. The county council told Exeter Observer that it had received “very positive” feedback from passengers since Country Bus took over.It is the provision of service information at bus stops that has been adversely affected by the change of operator, making the G service more difficult to use and undermining its integration with the rest of Exeter’s bus network.Country Bus G service to Exeter QuayTo be viable for use by anyone other than regular passengers, a bus stop must show which buses stop there and provide timetable information for each of those services.In Exeter city centre, where most stops have shelters, timetable information is shown in one panel while the routes served by the stop are shown variously in others, either on the reverse of the timetable information, or on flags fixed to a post or the roof of a shelter. At High Street stops the service numbers are shown on shelter roofs, rather than flags.A few electronic panels which show live times for all bus services, and the stops from which they depart, are located on the High Street and at the top of Fore Street. Stagecoach also produces timetable leaflets for its own services which are available at libraries, the tourist information centre and at the Stagecoach office in the bus station. Its app provides real-time service and other information.Route maps and “where to find your bus” guides are also on offer, but Devon County Council’s otherwise comprehensive timetable booklets for district council areas do not cover Exeter.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Responsibilities for providing information at bus stops vary. The city centre bus stop displays including summary posters, maps and flags are produced, maintained and paid for by Stagecoach as the principal operator of services in the area. The electronic real-time displays are maintained by the county council using vehicle location data supplied by the bus companies.Outside the city centre Stagecoach provides information at stops on its own routes at its discretion. Where Stagecoach does not serve a particular stop and the route is supported by the county council because it is not commercially viable, as is the case with the G service, Devon County Council supplies and maintains bus stop information.Yet not all bus stops outside the city centre carry timetable information or indeed any information at all. A recent survey of the G route’s eastern section between Blackboy Road and Polsloe found an information display case at only one stop: the Hamlin Gardens terminus.Hamlin Gardens bus stop information display caseSome city centre G service stops either fail to display the G timetable, or indicate that the G stops there, or both. The distribution of information is inconsistent. Devon County Council undertook to work with Stagecoach to improve matters in July after which a few helpful changes took place, but many gaps remain.At the city end of Sidwell Street (stop 18) there is a small timetable on the inside of the shelter and a flag, but the G does not have an entry on the route list. Its corresponding stop in the opposite direction (stop 25) shows a route list and a flag but no timetable. This is also the state of affairs at stops 5 and 6 on the High Street.Stops 24 and 29 at the Odeon end of Sidwell Street show the G on the route list but not on the flag, and there is no timetable information.At the same time, G services are not shown on the electronic real-time departure screens in the High Street and Fore Street.When asked about the missing screen information in July, Devon County Council said: “The database is currently in transition, involving a change in the company processing the data for us. This situation coincides with but is not related to the change on service G. Country Bus are fully equipped to enable real time monitoring of their buses, so when the data supply issue is fully resolved, the G should appear on the screens.”More than four months later the database still appears to be in transition and the county council is not responding to requests for an update.Exeter High Street stop 5 route listIn addition, the G service does not appear on the Stagecoach-produced Exeter route maps, and so does not show up in the Where to find your bus guide. Anyone looking at the Stagecoach maps would not know that a service exists along the G route.G service timetable leaflets are no longer available from the usual outlets, and while the county council’s interactive bus map does show the route, albeit as still operated by Stagecoach, it is near-impossible to use on a mobile phone.The upshot is that the G bus service is largely invisible, particularly to visitors who might otherwise find it very useful for reaching the quayside, an important Exeter leisure destination.Stagecoach might reasonably argue that it is not legally obliged to provide information about other companies’ bus services. Yet its near-monopoly position in Exeter does imply a responsibility to help passengers find their way round the whole city network.To some extent Stagecoach accepts this, since it does include partial information about the G service at its stops, and even provides a blank space on its timetable panels for another service timetable to be inserted.However Country Bus appears content not to display timetable information even at some stops where space is provided for it to do so.A Stagecoach timetable panel with a blank space supplied for Country Bus service informationDevon County Council’s Devon and Torbay Local Transport Plan 2011-2026 states that it seeks to provide an “integrated public transport service”. A specific promise in the transport plan is that “waiting facilities such as bus stops will be maintained and offer safe, secure places to wait and provide the customer with accurate travel information.”Anyone looking at the county council’s website might be forgiven for a degree of scepticism about its commitment to public transport. The relevant section is headed Roads and Transport as if roads existed as entities in their own right without being part of a transport system. Transport planning information is presented as a sub-section of Traffic information. And Devon County Council continues to spend almost all of its strategic transport budget on roads.The division of transport responsibilities in Conservative-led Devon County Council may be responsible for maintaining this outmoded approach. Transport is included in the briefs of no fewer than three county cabinet members: Councillor Stuart Hughes is responsible for highways, Councillor Andrea Davis for infrastructure schemes and Councillor Roger Croad for infrastructure strategy and transport services in the community.The county council’s chief executive confirmed this dilution of powers: “No cabinet member has overall responsibility for transport. The Cabinet works as a team to ensure co-ordination.”The back end of the Country Bus G service to Exeter QuayThere is little evidence that this team-working extends to thinking creatively about opportunities for improving bus services. The idea of taking steps to increase use of services such as the G, and so increase the value of their public subsidy, does not appear to be on the agendas of either Country Bus or Devon County Council.Worse, when Councillor Yvonne Atkinson, the Labour chair of the county council’s Exeter highways committee, asked what scope the administration saw for taking advantage of the new powers and opportunities presented by the Bus Services Act 2017 at a meeting on 24 May 2018, the response from Councillor Croad was, in brief, none.He and his colleagues might usefully consider the Campaign for Better Transport’s excellent guidance on using the act to improve local bus services in preparing their (delayed) Exeter Transport Strategy update.Meanwhile, Devon County Council could put into practice the fine words in its existing local transport plan about travel information at bus stops. It currently does not make use of procurement contracts to require the operators of subsidised bus routes to provide timetable and service information at bus stops: changing this would be a good start.Stagecoach and Country Bus were invited to comment on the issues raised in this article. Neither company responded."

"content" : "The Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership’s (LEP) new local industry strategy featured prominently at its annual conference in Torquay on 4 November despite it not yet having been published.It has been signed off by all the partners and seen by other stakeholders, but will remain otherwise unseen until it receives ministerial-level clearance in Whitehall.What are Local Enterprise Partnerships?In 2010 the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government published its blueprint for managing local economic growth. It abruptly replaced the nine appointee-led and locally unaccountable regional development agencies in England with 38 LEPs, which were to be business-led and reliant on local authorities and academic institutions for support.The blueprint was very much a do-it-yourself affair, part of the coalition’s initially warm words towards devolution of decision-making away from Whitehall.LEP boundaries were not prescribed centrally, which led to the idiosyncratic patchwork of LEPs that now blanket the country, often owing as much to the politics of local identity as to functional economic areas.The purpose of a LEP is to bid for money for its area from various central government funding streams, such as the local growth fund, and to use this to leverage local match funding. If successful, the LEP then allocates the money to local projects in line with the commitments given to central government and its own assessment of priorities.Heart of the South West LEP annual conference promotional materialThe LEP for the “Heart of the South West” covers the local authority areas of Devon, Somerset, Plymouth and Torbay. To date it claims to have pulled in over £323 million from central government and a further £460 million in locally raised match funding, which includes local public sector sources.For publicity purposes, and as set out in its 2019 annual report, the Heart of the South West LEP likes to imply that it is itself responsible for achievements such as building 4,431 new homes in the region.However in reality the LEP neither lays a single brick nor grants planning permissions for housing developments.Various reviews by central government, the National Audit Office, parliamentary committees and other organisations have highlighted concerns about the performance of LEPs, while recognising that central government support has at times been inconsistent with devolutionary principles.For example, LEPs have to reconcile their view of local investment priorities with central government policies which themselves pull in different directions, such as the deregulation of the planning system versus the need to control carbon emissions.They have also been accused of a lack of transparency and accountability, and of paying insufficient attention to the social and environmental impacts of their decisions. Many of the Heart of the South West LEP’s projects thus far have been road transport development schemes.

Local industrial strategiesIn 2018, central government instructed all LEPs to prepare local industrial strategies. A handful have already been published following government approval.The unpublished Heart of the South West local industrial strategy was described at the LEP’s annual conference by David Ralph, the chief executive appointed in June 2018, as a “game-changer”.His justification for this claim was that the strategy would focus on growth which was both “inclusive”, in the sense that its proceeds would be distributed more equitably among the area’s population, and “clean” because low carbon projects would be favoured.In other words, the LEP’s approach is no longer to promote economic growth for its own sake. Instead, growth will follow a net zero carbon route map.Heart of the South West LEP annual conference panel discussionPerhaps the most striking indicator of this new approach was a presentation by Charlotte Aldritt, director of the Centre for Progressive Policy and formerly a key player in the RSA’s inclusive growth project.Aldritt argued that the traditional measure of economic success - GVA, a shorthand for gross value added - is no longer fit for purpose, as it reinforces an economic model based on achieving growth first then deciding how to distribute its proceeds later.A high GVA figure for a city may be caused by highly skilled inward commuters, who are rewarded commensurately, while disguising the presence of residents who are excluded from earnings benefits. The persistence of low wages, as in Exeter, is evidence that this model does not work towards eliminating inequality.In contrast, Aldritt argued, investment should also encompass social infrastructure, such as education and skills, which tends to be excluded from the conventional view of infrastructure as physical provisions such as roads and broadband services.Factoring in social infrastructure investment enables a wider range of people to participate in the opportunities created in changing economies. GVA therefore needs to be reframed as an indicator which measures the quality of growth, including the extent of its distribution and improvements in the quality of jobs.Heart of the South West LEP compared with other areasCharlotte Aldritt’s argument is not new, since progressive analysts have been encouraging changes of this sort for several years. What is significant is its deployment as the keynote speech at this year’s LEP conference.CEO David Ralph said that he intended further collaboration with Charlotte Aldritt. She said she judged the unpublished local industrial strategy to be “superb”.On the evidence of this conference, the Heart of the South West LEP considers combining inclusive growth with clean growth to be a winning strategic formula.Is this a promise to deliver real change or simply some Whitehall-friendly window dressing? The answer will come in three parts.First, the extent to which local people and the councils that represent them recognise that the LEP is more than a businessmen’s club.Second, the continued ability of the LEP to attract funds from central government, local public sector bodies and the private sector.Third, and most crucially, the projects to which LEP funding is channelled in future and the criteria by which their success will be judged."

"content" : "Labour support collapsed in yesterday’s Devon County Council by-election in Heavitree and Whipton Barton, a former party stronghold, as voters went to the polls to elect a replacement for Emma Brennan, who resigned in September. A standards investigation concluded earlier this year that she had brought the council into disrepute with her conduct and she was ordered to undertake anger management training.Labour secured a comfortable victory in the previous county council election in 2017, with a majority of 834 after winning more than 51% of the vote. However in yesterday’s poll its support fell to just under 32% of votes cast  as candidate Greg Sheldon won 1119 votes fewer than his predecessor, reducing the Labour majority to just 40 votes. The turnout was 30.6%, down 10% from 2017.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            The Conservative Party came a close second, with a vote share down only slightly at 30.7% compared with 31.4% in 2017. Conservative candidate John Harvey said: “We fought an incredibly hard campaign and I’m proud to have turned a safe Labour seat into a tight marginal. The lesson from this by-election is that if Labour continue to take the voters of Exeter for granted, they’ll be punished for it.”Echoing these sentiments, Liberal Democrat candidate Rowena Squires said: “I think this was a really positive result for the Liberal Democrats. Amid the air of uncertainty in politics, voters are disillusioned and starting to re-identify how they vote. Although Labour held the seat, voters are looking for change. This is a combination of the national picture and local issues. Labour’s uncertainty over Brexit was on people’s minds as well as Labour’s local complacency.”“Heavitree and Whipton Barton has been a safe Labour seat for a long time. As a result Labour haven’t had to do as much work and voters felt their concerns weren’t heard. Ultimately, both the Lib Dems and the Greens ran strong campaigns. People enjoyed having their concerns heard.”2019 Heavitree &amp;amp; Whipton Barton by-election vote share swingLabour’s losses were divided equally between the Liberal Democrats and Exeter Green Party, each increasing their vote share by more than 11%. Rowena Squires received 576 votes, just 13 more than Green Party candidate Lizzie Woodman.Lizzie Woodman said: “This was a terrible night for Labour but a fantastic result for Greens. Labour lost almost 20% on their 2017 County Council election result, only narrowly beating the Conservatives.”“But the Conservative vote didn’t move, while Greens powered on almost tripling the percentage of the vote we received in 2017. This shows support for Labour in Exeter is crumbling while Greens are on the ascendancy.”“We also know from observing the counting of votes that in the Heavitree ward part of the division Greens topped the poll. I thank all those who voted Green at this election, those who want new voices and fresh thinking on our councils. I know we can win a future council election here.”Heavitree &amp;amp; Whipton Barton 2017-2019 vote comparisonThe by-election result echoed Labour’s losses in the city council elections held in May this year, when the party’s vote share dropped by 22.5% compared with 2018.Rowena Squires said: “Voters responded to the positive campaign the Lib Dems ran in Heavitree. I think people found it refreshing when compared with national politics.”“Going forward I think Exeter will see a lot of tight election races: there are no safe Labour seats anymore. It’s clear that both the Lib Dems and the Greens are on the rise.”Lizzie Woodman added: “With much talk of a general election and the national picture still so dominated by Brexit, this result could be seen as a barometer for what might happen nationally. And both the major parties should feel distinctly uncomfortable about this result.”“It suggests a massive decline in Labour support in traditionally strong Labour areas, while the Tories fail to make headway. Meanwhile, the combined vote of the two staunch remain parties, the Greens and Lib Dems, outperform both Labour and the Tories.”Winning candidate Greg Sheldon will join six Labour colleagues at County Hall, where 42 of 60 seats are held by the controlling Conservative Party.Greg Sheldon did not respond to a request for comment."

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s executive, the group of leading councillors who run the authority’s business, have agreed a package of changes to the current scrutiny arrangements set out in the council’s constitution.Taken together the changes weaken everyone’s capacity for challenging the executive. They will go for approval to a meeting of the full council next Tuesday 15 October.Scrutiny committees were introduced as part of legislative reforms to local government which allowed councils to replace the old system of decision-making by committees with “executive arrangements”. First introduced in 2000, the legislative basis is now in a schedule to the Localism Act 2011.Most councils have since set up executives or cabinets which effectively run the council’s business, with some decisions reserved for approval by the full council.To counterbalance this centralisation of control, councils are required to establish at least one scrutiny committee of councillors who are not part of the executive to scrutinise the actions of the executive.An alternative interpretation is that scrutiny committees exist simply to give non-executive councillors something to do.The key changes now proposed in Exeter relate to the composition and functions of scrutiny committees and to public participation at council committee meetings.They will also mean the leaders of opposition political groups are no longer entitled to a seat on the executive.Changes of particular interest to people concerned with openness and accountability follow.Changes to scrutiny committeesThe current three committees will be reduced to two, one covering “strategic” issues and the other addressing “customer focus”. The allocation of individual services and policies to the committees is not yet fully clear.There is no specific remit in the new committees’ terms of reference to hold the executive to account, though doing so is not a marked characteristic of the current committees.The practice of scrutiny committees commenting on officer proposals before they are considered by the executive will cease. This means that councillors on the executive will take decisions based solely on advice from the council’s officers, without any formal input from non-executive councillors in advance.It also reduces the time available for public scrutiny of proposals because papers will only be published by the council a week before each executive meeting. At present, scrutiny papers are published a week before scrutiny committee meetings, and so are available a fortnight or so before the executive meetings at which decisions are taken.Both chair and deputy chair of all three scrutiny committees are currently selected from the ruling political group. In future deputy chairs will be elected from opposition parties. While their election at full council gives the ruling political group an effective veto over their appointment, it is not clear whether the ruling group would choose to wield this power.A new Scrutiny Programme Board will supervise the work of the scrutiny committees and set their priorities. The chairs and deputy chairs of the scrutiny committees will be members of the board, and its chair will be nominated by the leader of the council.As a board rather than a statutory committee, it is likely that it will meet in private session.

Subscribe freePublic participation at council meetingsMembers of the public can currently only ask questions at scrutiny committee meetings. In future such questions will be allowed at full council meetings and, provided they relate to agenda items, at executive meetings. However, the same question will not be permitted at more than one meeting.The changes place other new restrictions on questions. No more than fifteen minutes will be allowed at each meeting for public questions. This is in line with East Devon and Teignbridge district councils, though Mid Devon and Devon County Council allow 30 minutes.This limit may unreasonably restrict public participation where a single issue of major public concern dominates the agenda. It will also limit questions at meetings with full agendas. The next full council meeting agenda contains seventeen items of business: the new rules would allow less than a minute of questions (and answers) for each.Questions will also have to observe a 50-word limit. This arguably favours those with a stronger command of English because of the challenge of framing a question precisely enough to avoid an evasive answer.Questioners will in future be restricted to one question per meeting. They will be able to ask one supplementary question, though the current right to make a two minute statement to the committee appears to have been dropped, and the supplementary question must be based on the response to the original question.Council leader Phil Bialyk commended the changes, saying the current arrangements dated from a time when the balance of power was more evenly distributed between parties, and that now Labour held 29 of 39 seats the situation had changed.Neither of the opposition members of the executive, Andrew Leadbetter (Conservative) or Kevin Mitchell (Liberal Democrat), was present but Councillor Bialyk assured the meeting that both were “supportive” of the proposals.In response to a comment from Green Party councillor Diana Moore, Councillor Bialyk gave an assurance that no one would be disadvantaged by the 50-word question limit, saying that the council secretariat would assist people who were having difficulty complying.Exeter residents with views on the proposed changes can send them to their ward councillors before the full council meeting on 15 October.Should the changes be approved at that meeting, they will take effect immediately.Contact information for councillors is available on the city council website."

"content" : "Fridays For Future Exeter, the youth climate strikers who led 3500 people on a march through the city as part of today’s global climate strike, have launched a detailed vision for a Green New Deal for Devon.In the fourteen page document they call on elected representatives across the county to recognise the climate crisis as a symptom of a dysfunctional political economy and to place it at the centre of every policy, planning and spending decision they make.It focusses on the interdependence of climate and social justice, addressing a wide range of issues from unaffordable bus travel and rural unemployment to the flaws in carbon trading and credit schemes which mean they simply don’t work.Transport, the UK’s biggest greenhouse gas-emitting sector and a key issue in a county which heavily depends on private vehicle use, comes in for particular scrutiny. The Office for National Statistics reported this week that greenhouse gas emissions from road transport have increased by 6% since 1990, making up one fifth of the UK’s total emissions in 2017. Despite this, 93% of the county’s highways capital spending budget is allocated to road building and the promotion of incremental behavioural change, such as “encouraging active travel”, remains at the centre of county transport policy.The impact of aviation at Exeter airport is also a major concern. A recent study showed that carbon dioxide emissions from commercial flights are rising up to 70% faster than predicted while zero emissions passenger aircraft are, at best, decades away. The growth of Exeter airport is nevertheless regularly promoted by key local organisations.Agriculture, which emits more greenhouse gases than transport in Devon, is the subject of farming and land use proposals informed by carbon opportunity cost analysis which promote the restoration of habitats, rewilding and the provision of equitable access to natural resources such as clean air and water and green spaces. The county’s food production and supply chains are also addressed.The document also deals with energy, housing, health and social care, the impact of the retail sector and the “business as usual” approach that currently drives much local and regional social and economic policy.  Green New Deal for Devon: an open letter  The Green New Deal is a set of five principles. These principles aim to guide our response to the climate and ecological crisis in a way that prioritises social justice, delivers well-paid, meaningful jobs and a habitable future. To guarantee human and ecological well-being, as well as the development of political and economic democracy, any policy plans must fit within the framework offered by the Green New Deal principles. We will not settle for anything less.  A Green New Deal works towards creating an economy embedded within nature, thus building resilience in the community it is situated in. A decade of austerity has crippled communities across the UK, and people are ready to transform their economic and environmental futures. A Green New Deal puts people and planet first — harnessing the energy of many who have been left behind by a forever failing politics. It ensures we better steward and repair natural systems; that we incorporate democracy and justice into economic and social life; that we reimagine and expand prosperity. A Green New Deal is our vision for the future, and we want everyone to be a part of it.  So, we invite you, whoever you are - councillor, friend, worker, unionist, farmer and beyond - to take this proposal as the opening of a new conversation, one in which all contributions are considered as bringing value as long as they don’t reaffirm business as usual. We need to do what is required of us – not simply what is seen as politically possible.  To make that happen, we propose to massively shift the debate on climate change in the UK. This must begin on a local level with immediate and extensive local action. This action must go beyond setting up a solar farm and “encouraging” active transport to fundamentally change how we all view the economy, nature, and decision-making. A Green New Deal will involve many different policies, but all will be rooted in the five principles, and therefore be democratic, sustainable, and equal by design.  We present these demands to Devon County Council and the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group as clear examples of what they can do on a local level to support climate justice for our communities. We have demonstrated that the responses of many other UK local authorities to the climate emergency far exceed those in Devon. This must change.  The science tells us we need a rapid and significant transformation. Listening and responding to the views of ordinary citizens must be a crucial part of this transformation. These demands are our contribution. We’re aged between thirteen and twenty-one. In addition to working towards our GCSEs, A Levels or degrees, we’ve spent our summer educating ourselves about a Green New Deal. We’ve researched policies, planning proposals, and budget reports. We are making our voices heard; we hope that Devon County Council and its Devon Climate Emergency Response Group partners listen then act.  However, we do recognise that the past decade of austerity has gutted local government of funding. This is why a national Green New Deal will devolve more power and funding to councils and communities. We need local action to send signals to central government to make this a reality.  We have also only addressed Devon’s district and county councils in this initial draft of the plan, however we recognise that there are many groups with the ability to drive change. This plan is a work in progress, and future editions will be updated to address a wider body of people. We call on you first, because you are elected, and accountable to the people.  So, whoever is reading this, start talking, start organising, come to us with proposals and we’ll have a meeting. This strike is just the beginning. Draft One, done. Who knows where we’ll go next?  In love, rage, fear, and respect,  Fridays For Future Exeter.The Fridays For Future Exeter Green New Deal for Devon is primarily addressed to Devon County Council as the principal regional authority, and the Devon Climate Emergency Response Group (DCERG) that it convened in response to the sequence of youth climate strikes that took place in the spring.However, despite the county council declaring a climate emergency in February, the Net-Zero Task Force appointed by the DCERG to develop a Devon Carbon Plan has yet to hold its first meeting seven months later.At the same time, according to the county council website, only ten of the group’s 27 members have so far signed the Devon Climate Declaration it published in May, four months ago.This has not, however, deterred it from creating two more QUANGOs, a Devon Climate Emergency Tactical Group, and a Climate Impacts Group. Nor has it deterred Devon County Council from publishing no fewer than sixteen press releases promoting its sustainability credentials during the same period.Neither DCERG nor its three sub-groups publish their agendas or meet in public, nor are any of their members elected. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the group has embraced the oxymoronic “clean growth agenda” and a reliance on private sector investmentThe DCERG aims to publish the Devon Carbon Plan by the end of 2020, two years after it first considered the climate emergency motion brought by Green Party councillor Jacqui Hodgson. The original motion proposed a 2030 decarbonisation deadline; Devon County Council leader John Hart removed this without replacing it.The citizens’ assembly, depicted at the bottom of the DCERG stakeholder map above, is only scheduled to meet during two of the eighteen months timetabled for the delivery of the Devon Carbon Plan. The DCERG intends it only to discuss options drawn up by the Net-Zero Task Force, and has yet to announce how its members will be selected.The Fridays for Future Exeter Green New Deal for Devon document lays out a diametrically different vision of participation in local democracy. It says a citizens’ assembly should not only be demographically representative, but also specifically include marginalised social groups.It also says a citizens’ assembly must be an ongoing, regular, integrated part of council decision-making and not a one-off occurrence and that its members must be involved in formulating policy and not just ratifying proposals that are likely to represent regressive agendas.In addition, it proposes a people-led Green New Deal Commission to act as a DCERG watchdog to ensure the unelected membership of the DCERG and its sub-groups delivers the ecological and social goals at the heart of the Green New Deal vision.  Green New Deal for Devon: principles      Totally decarbonise the economy of Devon in a way that enhances the lives of ordinary people, workers and communities and works to eliminate social and economic inequality.    Create new green, well-paid, secure, unionised jobs across the county guaranteeing healthy and fulfilling livelihoods for all workers, and communities including those in today’s high emissions sectors.    Transform our economy to place human and ecological well-being and prosperity at its centre; enable democratic participation, accountability and common ownership. Our economy must work in the interests of everyone, which means empowering those communities currently marginalised.    Protect and restore vital habitats and carbon sinks, including forests and wild areas, and ensure the provision of clean water, air, green spaces and a healthy environment for all.    Promote global justice by supporting all peoples and countries to decarbonise quickly and fairly, in line with timeframes set out by science, including through transfers of resources, finance and technology from historic emitters in the Global North to the Global South.  The idea of a Green New Deal was originally developed by a group including Green Party MP Caroline Lucas that began meeting in 2007 in response to contemporary financial, energy and environmental crises.It was inspired by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, which saved the US from the worst impacts of the Great Depression in the 1930’s and produced a new political realignment that sustained greater social and economic equality and environmental protection until the rise of monetarism in the 1970’s.

In partnership with Labour MP Clive Lewis, Caroline Lucas has today presented a Green New Deal bill to Parliament which aims to move our economy away from its harmful dependence on carbon, at the scale and speed demanded by the science, and to build a society that lives within its ecological limits while reversing social and economic inequality.At the same time Molly Scott Cato, Green Party MEP for the South West, is promoting a Green New Deal for the South West in events across the region.She said: “The climate emergency requires a new economic approach. One that is no longer centred on growth or unsustainable consumption but on a circular and green economy.”“The South West was once the beating heart of the industrial revolution. It can now become the centre of a green industrial revolution. The region has huge potential to be a beacon for the rest of the country – and the rest of Europe.”“Crucially, a Green New Deal also offers the prospect of thousands of new jobs and seeks to tackle inequality and improve health and well-being.”She will be joined at the Exeter event next Thursday by Jodie Giles of Regen, Fernanda Balata of New Economics Foundation and Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw.Representatives of Fridays for Future Exeter will also be on the panel.The Fridays for Future Green New Deal for Devon is a collaborative document to which everyone is invited to contribute."

"content" : "An estimated 3500 people marched through Exeter today as part of a global climate strike that saw more than 200 similar events take place across the UK, with millions demonstrating in 185 countries worldwide.The march, which was led by Fridays for Future Exeter, part of the UK Student Climate Network, gathered in Bedford Street before setting off to County Hall via the High Street. So many people took part that the head of the march reached Magdalen Street before its last members had set off.A samba band added to the festival atmosphere, which continued at County Hall with music, speakers and workshops. Free vegan food was laid on by volunteers.Today’s climate strike was backed by dozens of organisations including Greenpeace UK, Friends of the Earth, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), Black Lives Matter UK, Christian Aid and Amnesty UK.Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International Secretary General, wrote to almost 25,000 UK schools urging them to allow their pupils to take part.He said: “The climate emergency is the defining human rights issue for this generation of children. Its consequences will shape their lives in almost every way imaginable. The failure of most governments to act in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence is arguably the biggest inter-generational human rights violation in history.”“By taking part in these protests, children are exercising their human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and to have a say in decisions and matters that affect their lives. In doing so, they are teaching us all a valuable lesson: the importance of coming together to campaign for a better future.”The Trades Union Congress (TUC) also backed the strike at its annual conference in Brighton earlier this month.Many unions, including NEU, NASUWT, NUJ, PCS, Prospect, UNISON, Unite and UCU, who proposed the TUC conference motion, organised their own workday campaign actions in solidarity with the student strikers.Liza Sentance, Chair of Torbay &amp;amp; South Devon Trades Council, said: “The trade union movement was asked to support the kids on their strike today so that’s why I’m here, supporting them. I also have five grandchildren: their future is important as well. I’ve vowed not to buy any new clothes this year and I’ve sold my car.”Stewart Ward, Exeter City Council UNISON branch secretary, said he was there “to support the young people in their protests” and “to show that, as a branch, we’re supporting what the council are doing by declaring a climate emergency and moving towards being carbon neutral in the future.” Graeme Tweedy, mental health nurse and UNISON representative at Devon Partnership NHS Trust and Community Health, said he was there “because climate change is a health issue, it is something that affects everybody and is our number one threat.”He said that the union had just run a green week to support the youth strikers, with stalls at Wonford House and the Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter Hospital to raise awareness of the issue.All the UK’s main opposition parties backed today’s climate strike, although the Labour Party has been strongly criticised for allowing Heathrow, London City and Gatwick airports as well as oil company BP to sponsor events at its annual conference in Brighton this week.Phil Bialyk, Exeter City Council leader and Labour councillor for Exwick, said: “I welcome the show of support from people of all ages who came out to raise awareness of the devastating effects of climate change.”“It was great to see so many staff from the city council taking part and showing their commitment to the cause. There is clearly a lot of work to do to make an impact but we have made a commitment to creating a carbon-neutral city.” Diana Moore, Green Party councillor for St David’s, said: “This is fantastic, the most amazing turnout I’ve ever seen for any campaign in Exeter. It sends such a strong message because it’s making decision-makers feel really uncomfortable. We need decision-makers to follow through on the things that they say.”“Young people here are focussed on the issues they want us all to engage with. This is about science and understanding its insights. It’s about making sure young people have the skills and knowledge they need for jobs for the future.”Kevin Mitchell, Liberal Democrat councillor for Duryard &amp;amp; St James, said: “I’m here because we only have one planet, so it’s very important that everyone is here today making their voices heard to ensure that the right agenda and the right policies come forward at all levels, whether that’s local level, council level, all the way up to government and globally as well.”“Hopefully this will put more pressure on those authorities and on Exeter City Council to implement its climate emergency agenda.”When asked about the county council’s response to the situation, he said: “I’m extremely frustrated at the lack of movement. You can declare something, which is all well and good, but that’s just words. It’s more about the action required to ensure that you have the right policies and the right things happening on the ground so we do the right thing for our city and our planet. At the moment I don’t think that’s happening.”Tom Deakin, Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Exeter, said: “I think it’s wonderful that so many people have come out today, young and old, to stand up for the future of our planet. I think it’s a real shame that we’ve had to get to this point, where it’s this kind of action that’s necessary to make government and those in control of the global order actually listen. I’m here to support the young people who are standing up for their future.”With the exception of Lush, which closed down all its global operations for the day, including its factories and shops, and replaced its website with a low energy holding page, the rest of Exeter’s city centre chain retailers remained open.However, several independent local businesses closed for the day to support the strike and allow their staff to attend the march. These included Hilton Barnfield Architects, The Real Food Store and The Roots Foundation.Other local organisations also took part in the march. Tony Whitehead of RSPB South West said: “We are supporting this climate strike today because we want to show solidarity with the thousands of young people who are so passionate about this cause, who are clearly saying here, and around the world, that they’ve had enough, change needs to happen and it needs to happen urgently.”“This must be one of the biggest demonstrations in Exeter’s history. I’ve lived here for 30 years and I’ve never seen one as big as this. It is just amazing. I hope people are listening and that they’ll take action.”Today’s strike took place the eve of a UN Climate Action Summit in New York called by its secretary general António Guterres to inject urgency into government action to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5°C, the target adopted in the 2015 Paris agreement.He has called on all leaders to attend the meeting on 23 September with “concrete, realistic plans” to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and “show the way toward a full transformation of economies in line with sustainable development goals.”In an interview with Covering Climate Now earlier this week, he praised the “fantastic leadership” of young climate activists and said he was counting on public pressure to compel governments to take much bolder action.

"content" : "Exeter University &amp;amp; College Union (UCU) has launched a campaign to address widespread casualisation of academic staff at the University of Exeter.The education union’s new general secretary, Jo Grady, introduced the initiative at a launch event on Friday.She pointed at Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) figures for 2016-17 that show 64% of all academic staff at the University of Exeter are employed on insecure contracts.The figures reveal that only 1275 of the university’s 3520 academic staff were permanently employed or possessed open-ended contracts.UCU collation of this data places Exeter as the sixth most insecure employer in the Russell Group and 23rd most insecure among 165 UK higher education institutions.2017-18 statistics show an unchanged distribution, with 1390 of a total of 3870 academic staff employed permanently or on open-ended contracts.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            A University of Exeter spokesperson said: “The figures quoted by the UCU on casual contracts include anyone working on a very short term basis to undertake marking or teaching which comprises around 4.5% of our total academic workforce.”The question of how, and whether, to include very short term employees in academic staff figures is vexed. HESA began collecting statistics on hourly-paid and zero hours contract employees for its 2017/18 data set after consultation with staff representatives, but conclusions drawn from this new information depend on how it is interpreted.HESA’s definition of “atypical” staff excludes very short term academic employees from comparison with staff on other contract types despite significant numbers of people being employed this way.Philippa Davey, an official at UCU’s South West regional branch said: “UCU have requested figures for the workforce at Exeter University on numerous occasions but are yet to receive a full breakdown of hourly paid, casual, fixed term and permanent staff.”Rhian Keyse speaking at Exeter UCU’s anti-casualisation campaign launchRhian Keyse, Exeter UCU Vice-President and a member of UCU’s national anti-casualisation campaign committee, presented the findings of UCU research into the impact of insecure employment contracts at the campaign launch.Of nearly 4000 UK university staff employed on insecure contracts surveyed earlier this year, almost 60% said they had struggled to make ends meet.71% said they believed their mental health had been damaged by working on insecure contracts and 83% said their contractual status made it hard to make long-term family plans or long-term financial commitments such as buying a house.85% said they had considered leaving the sector in the last twelve months, with the number one reason for doing so being the lack of job security.Rhian Keyse also said insecure employment contracts were detrimental to the student experience. 67% of teaching staff said they did not have enough paid time to enable them to prepare adequately for their classes and 44% said they did not have access to adequate facilities to provide feedback and support to students.She said that teaching staff have to deliver student contact sessions in non-private spaces such as coffee shops or the Forum atrium due to lack of access to appropriate space in which to discuss what may be confidential or sensitive issues, such as grades.Philippa Davey said: “We have evidence from members regarding contact sessions being delivered in spaces that are not confidential and of a lack of the basic resources required to deliver quality teaching and tutorials.”The university said it does not compel teaching staff to conduct student contact sessions in non-private spaces such as coffee shops.In addition, the university restricts postgraduate students to a maximum of six hours work each week, in line with research council award conditions on studentship holders, whether or not students are funded. However, in contrast with other comparable institutions, it continues to impose this limit after award periods end.Philippa Davey said: “Students with no other form of income are disadvantaged by this ruling. We have members who have been unable to feed themselves, pay rent or bills and have had to seek work outside the university to enable them to survive. If other universities allow additional hours, why does Exeter insist on applying this rule?”The university said that the rationale for restricting postgraduate student working hours is an educational rather than organisational decision intended to protect study time and support students in completing their postgraduate degrees.  Exeter UCU’s objectives      Tackle unpaid labour inc. increase paid preparation time to 2:1 ratio    Remove unequal treatment across university schools, colleges and services    End the use of “worker” contracts via external agencies, staff banks or subsidiary companies    End the use of zero hours contracts inc. replacement with fractional employment contracts    Move hourly-paid lecturers to fractional contracts at 0.2FTE or above    Reduce the use of fixed-term contracts to create greater job security and employment continuity    Review arbitrary restrictions on working hours for unfunded postgraduate students    Provide adequate staff facilities for fulfilment of necessary duties    Provide facilities time for staff representatives to conduct negotiations  A growing body of peer-reviewed academic research indicates that the efficiency gains claimed for flexible employment arrangements are illusory, and only save money at the cost of organisational learning, knowledge accumulation and knowledge sharing, thus damaging innovation and labour productivity growth.UCU’s research reflects these findings: 81% of researchers said their research activity had been negatively affected by employment on short-term contracts, only 21% agreed that casual employment was an “economical and cost-effective” way to employ research staff and 95% said that more secure employment would help foster genuinely innovative research activity.The university said that it has introduced new business rules on temporary working to ensure that short term contracts are only used in specific circumstances, such as to support ad hoc marking or teaching.Philippa Davey said: “The research is very clear. The continued marketisation of education does not lead to higher standards or increased quality, rather the reverse. The flexibility and efficiencies are only a gain for the employer, not for the workers or the students.”The University of ExeterThe University of Exeter has already changed its approach to employing postgraduate students after pressure from the UCU.In September 2018 Sir Steve Smith, the university’s vice-chancellor, said postgraduate students who worked regular or pre-scheduled hours would be employed on annual contracts, conferring benefits enjoyed by permanent employees such as sick leave, maternity pay and access to the university pension scheme.However the change was a temporary pilot scheduled to run for one year, and did not apply to other hourly paid teaching staff. The university said that it has since extended the scheme.Philippa Davey said: “UCU has been raising the issue of casualisation at the University of Exeter for a number of years. It is only in the past twelve months that we have seen any real movement. Our members are very clear that progress made so far, although very welcome, is not fast enough.“We acknowledge the work that management have done to convert graduate workers to fractional contracts but this was very slow to start and initially did not include UCU.”A university spokesperson said: “We share the UCU’s desire to provide the best possible job security and financial stability to everyone who works at the University of Exeter and together we have made good progress in recent years.”“This includes from August 2018 paying the Living Wage to casual workers benefiting several hundred people and the introduction in 2018/19 of new contract arrangements for postgraduate students working as teachers.”“In the coming months, we will continue to seek to work with UCU and our postgraduates to get the right balance between flexible working, supporting postgraduate study and improving contracts of work.”Jo Grady speaking at Exeter UCU’s anti-casualisation campaign launchOther universities have made significant changes to their employment practices. The University of Sheffield has agreed to end the use of casual contracts, Durham University has scrapped nine month teaching contracts and the Open University has moved 4000 associate lecturers onto permanent contracts.The University of Edinburgh has agreed to abolish zero hour contracts and the University of Glasgow has made similar commitments.UCU casualisation campaigns are also under way at other institutions, including the University of Cambridge, and negotiations are underway elsewhere, including at the University of Bristol.Exeter UCU has now begun a formal negotiation process with the University of Exeter which it aims to conclude by the end of the 2020 summer term so that changes are implemented by this time next year.A university spokesperson said: “Building on joint work in the 2018/19 academic year, the University of Exeter has advised the UCU that we are keen to work with them on the important issues they raise on short and fixed term contracts with an open offer to develop a joint approach.”Philippa Davey said: “We have signed off a number of agreements across the South West with other institutions. The claim we have submitted formalises the requests we have made and sets a realistic time line for making progress.”She added: “We look forward to working with management to ensure staff and students get the very best from the institution as an employer and educator.”"

"content" : "An estimated two thousand people packed Exeter’s Bedford Square on Saturday 31 August to protest against the government’s Brexit policies and its highly controversial decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks from 10 September.Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw said it was one of the biggest gatherings he had seen in the 23 years he has represented the city, and paid tribute to Conservative MPs prepared to put national interest before party loyalty.South West MEP Caroline Voaden argued that the European Parliament was far more effective at scrutinising legislation and keeping EU bureaucracy in check than anything that went on at Westminster.Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston said the final Brexit deal should be put to the people in a referendum and if not, there should be a general election.Also on the platform were speakers from campaigning organisation Devon for Europe and the trade union movement, a leave voter who had changed his mind about Brexit since the June 2016 referendum, and Phil Bialyk, Leader of Exeter City Council, whose delight at the size of the crowd moved him to plug the renationalisation of the railways.The demonstration combined two main, but muddled, lines of protest. On the one hand were those whose principal goal is to stop Brexit, or at least a no-deal Brexit. On the other were those protesting against the government’s decision to prorogue parliament for the longest period in more than 40 years.These are very distinct issues: the first a matter of policy, the second an affront to democracy itself.Most points made in the speeches about Brexit were already familiar, and it was only when speakers touched on constitutional issues that anything new came forward.Mike Finn, a trade union speaker who teaches history at the University of Exeter, reminded the crowd that parliament can play a vital role at times of national emergency, such as when it replaced Chamberlain’s feeble government with the wartime coalition led by Churchill and Attlee.So what was the protest’s purpose? Exeter city councillor Hannah Packham, one of its organisers, said she saw prorogation of parliament as its focus. Chris Bray of Devon for Europe emphasised opposition to Brexit, including demands for a second vote, though he also recognised the importance of prorogation. Ben Bradshaw simply said it was both.Demonstrators’ clothing reflected this ambiguity. Those dressed in the vivid blue of the European flag were in stark contrast with the sober dress of the majority, which matched the greyness of the morning and made their allegiances less visible.The Devon for Europe speaker, both on the platform and in the crowd, enthusiastically waved her flag and led chants of: “What do we want? Democracy! When do we want it? Now!”Given that the problem is not that the UK doesn’t have democracy but has a version of it that allows charlatans and extremists to take charge, this may not have been the most appropriate chorus.Not to mention the much-discussed democratic deficit in the EU’s governance structures.One reason for the mixed messages may have been that the protest had at least two organisers. Exeter Labour Party were responsible for the platform arrangements and Facebook promotion while Another Europe is Possible claims to have co-ordinated the 30 or so rallies that took place around the country on the same day.While this organisation is unambiguously pro-remain, it has extended its scope to cover the current constitutional crisis using the hashtag #StopTheCoup.Was the protest a vehicle for opponents of Brexit to use the controversy surrounding prorogation of parliament to bolster the anti-Brexit campaign? Or was it an expression of disgust at the government’s contempt for the constitution?Either way, this and similar popular demonstrations do not appear have given ministers much pause for thought."

"content" : "As the summer’s second heatwave came to an end, around 150 people joined a funereal procession through Exeter city centre to highlight the destruction caused by climate change and to promote the urgent need for radical action if further devastation is to be avoided.Pall bearers carrying a coffin representing the death of the natural world were led by a mute chief mourner, head shrouded, who slowly beat a drum to announce the cortège that followed. Dressed in black from head to toe with faces powdered white, its members offered onlookers origami lilies carrying the names of extinct British species.A large congregation of mourners walked in their wake, following a banner emblazoned with the Extinction Rebellion hourglass symbol and the words: “Business as usual = death”.After gathering at Southernhay, the mourners set off along Bedford Street before turning down the High Street, where a local band who had been entertaining a rowdy crowd changed tempo to accompany the cortège with elegiac music.Passing the Guildhall, the procession turned at Broadgate to cross Cathedral Green before heading back up Cathedral Close towards St Martin’s Church. It wound through Princesshay then turned at Eastgate to head for the graveyard at St Sidwell’s, where the coffin was delivered to its final resting place.Celia Villa-Landa, a 75 year-old grandmother of six, was among the mourners. She said: “I’m here because of my grandchildren. I want them to have the world I grew up in. I’m really very frightened by the way things are speeding up. I was reading this morning about wildfires all around the Arctic. You can see the smoke from space. I just find it terrifying.”She was referring to hundreds of wildfires that have recently broken out in Siberia, Scandinavia, Alaska and Greenland, emitting as much carbon dioxide in June as Sweden does in a whole year.Celia, who was a city councillor in the Stoke Hill and Beacon Heath areas of Exeter in the 1980s, added: “We have to persuade people to stop flying, to eat less beef. The children really care. They want us to do something.”Another mourner, Anouska Kirby, a primary school teaching assistant and mother of two, expressed similar concerns. She said she had decided to take action “because I want a future for my children. In 2050 they will be 35 and 44 years old. I want them to have a decent world to inhabit.”When asked how she came to be involved, she said: “I kept thinking I haven’t got time. I’ve got too much going on. I’ve got a family and I’m working. And then I thought: actually I’m just making excuses. I just need to get on with it and do something.”“I’ve been reading up on climate change for a while now and it’s starting to feel like I can’t just ignore this any more. And if I only make a tiny bit of difference, even if I don’t make any difference, at least I will have tried.”Anouska doesn’t drive and had travelled into Exeter by train from Crediton. She was aware both city and county councils had recently announced initiatives to develop carbon reduction plans but said she thought action was needed now.“I’m worried that it needs to be done very, very urgently, not in a few years. Lots of people are choosing to ignore it. Ignorance is easier than actually facing the truth.”The cortège took two hours to travel from Southernhay to St Sidwell’s, bringing traffic to a standstill and causing some onlookers to complain about delays to buses.Ashley Carr, a local Conservative Party campaigner who stood in St Thomas in the recent city council elections, said he appreciated the message that climate change is real and needs to be dealt with, but suggested that disrupting traffic, including buses, was going too far.He also defended the Conservative government’s record on the issue: “It’s not business as usual to get a whole country to be net zero, to produce no carbon emissions, in 30 years. And they want it done by 2025?”A passing Stagecoach driver also pointed out that buses obstructed by the procession were standlng idle with their engines running, although she added that the most recent models were fitted with automatic engine stop/start systems similar to many modern cars.She nevertheless said she was “very supportive” of the protestors, saying “they are achieving something because people are stopping and looking”.Jay Quick, a personal trainer, agreed. He had been struck by the silence that fell across Cathedral Green when the procession passed through. He said he found the protest poignant: “People take notice of something quiet, something still”.Saturday’s protest came two days after what has since been confirmed as the UK’s hottest day on record, when a peak temperature of 38.7°C was recorded in Cambridge. Temperature records were simultaneously broken in the Netherlands, Germany and France. Paris endured 42.6°C.Peak temperatures in Northern Europe are expected to rise much further. A recent report predicted that London’s warmest month will be nearly 6°C hotter by 2050, matching Melbourne now, and is likely to be accompanied by severe drought.Meanwhile, the impact of such changes is already causing mass migration at more southerly latitudes.Colin Barrington, a cortège pall bearer, said: “Climate change deniers will say there’s always been these extremes of weather, there’s always been hot weather. Yes, there have been extremes, but they’ve been localised.”“Now, the whole globe is experiencing this. Australia: the hottest temperatures ever. The Far East: the hottest temperatures ever. The whole of Europe. It’s not localised: it’s now the whole globe.”Amber Wren, who led the mourners, added: “Other countries are not that far away from us. They’re experiencing droughts, wildfires, crop loss, starvation, forced migration.”She said the protest had been “really effective” and had had a “powerful impact”, adding: “There will be continuous action. Extinction Rebellion is decentralised so there are many, many groups across the country, all deciding and taking their own localised actions. So we’ll see many, many smaller localised actions.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.

"content" : "Exeter City Council’s decision to close thirteen of the city’s public toilets was reported by Exeter Observer on 11 June. However inadequate the closure process itself, we accepted that the decision was driven by the need to save £60,000 from the council’s 2019/20 budget in order to balance the books. Subsequent document disclosures suggest the situation was not so straightforward.On 27 June the council’s Corporate Services Scrutiny Committee reviewed spending across the council for 2018/19 and looked at forward pressures in 2019/20. Included in the revenue spending report was a “requirement for significant supplementary budgets in 2019/20 as the Council has identified at the end of the year a number of revenue budgets that have not been spent but where a commitment is required in the following financial year”.Exeter City Council budget cuts - work in progressThese carried-forward budgets included £34,000 for public relations promotion for the new leisure complex, £112,000 for the demolition of Clifton Hill sports centre, £125,000 for staffing, and £750,000 for “Greater Exeter” planning work.Excluding spending on the council’s own housing, the additional budgets amounted to nearly £1.4 million, found from Community Infrastructure Levy (6%), earmarked reserves (33%) and the General Fund working balance (61%). The working balance is the amount set aside as a final contingency for unanticipated fluctuations in the council’s spending and income and which Exeter City Council has set at a minimum of £3 million.At the start of the 2019/20 financial year the General Fund working balance was £4.4 million. By the time the supplementary budgets had been factored in, it was down to £3.5 million, still £0.5 million above the minimum level.

The argument used by the council to support the closure of thirteen public toilets in order to save £60,000 a year was that there was no alternative: the savings had to be made to balance the budget. As £500,000 remains in the reserve, the £60,000 could have been taken from there while still leaving the working balance £440,000 above the set minimum. That would still have met the requirement for a balanced budget.But at no stage during the public discussion of the issue in council committees was the question of using reserves raised, either by councillors or by officers.Exeter City Council public toilet closures - Musgrave Row beside Exeter LibraryIndeed, as noted in our previous report, councillors were told they had to identify compensatory savings if they wished to retain the toilets budget. This instruction by Councillor Luke Sills, Chair of the Place Scrutiny Committee, visibly influenced Councillors Owen and Pattison (and doubtless others, invisibly) in their conclusion that there was therefore no alternative, despite the fact that sufficient funding did in fact exist in the reserves. Councillor Sills’ instruction did not appear in the minutes of the meeting.These are not procedural trivialities. The provision of public toilets is a serious public health issue. The key findings of a recent report by the Royal Society for Public Health are below:  From Taking the P**** - The Decline of the Great British Public Toilet, Royal Society for Public Health, May 2019      The increasing decline in public toilets is a threat to health, mobility, and equality.    The lack of public toilets disproportionately affects people with ill health or disability, the elderly, women, outdoor workers and the homeless.    Three in four of the UK public think there are not enough public toilets in their area.    Knowledge of lack of facilities nearby acts as a “loo leash”, deterring as many as one in five (20%) from venturing out of their homes as often as they would like. This rises to over two in five (43%) among those with medical conditions requiring frequent toilet use.    Over half (56%) of the public restrict fluid intake due to concern over lack of toilet facilities. Deliberate dehydration can seriously affect health and exacerbate existing medical problems.  Some, though not all, of these points were included in the impact assessment of the closure proposals considered by councillors.So the question remains: why was the closure of thirteen toilets so important to the council that officers and councillors took the approach that there was no alternative to doing so? Why was the option of funding from reserves not offered?Was it that the council feared that the cost of bringing the toilets up to modern standards was too much for the capital programme to bear, as it is already stretched to breaking point by the new leisure complex?Or was it an attempt to reduce anti-social behaviour associated with public toilets?If so, first impressions are not encouraging. Reports of people urinating on the graves in Exeter’s Higher Cemetery – where the public toilets have been closed as a result of this decision – recently made front page news.Exeter City Council Exeter Live Better hoardingExeter City Council has spent, and is still spending, tens of thousands of pounds promoting the city under the Exeter Live Better banner. Does access to a public toilet not improve quality of life in the city? Exeter could, and should, do better.Neither Exeter City Council nor Councillor Sills responded to a request for comment.UPDATE – 9 July 2019Councillor Sills has now replied to our request for comment, which we sent ten days before publication.He said: “I acted entirely appropriately at the meeting in reminding members of their legal responsibilities to maintain a balanced budget. The decision to close public toilets was not a decision we took lightly, and must be seen within the context of the council having to find significant savings in coming years due to continued reductions in our grant from central government. I must add that as a council we are tasked with finding a further £2.4m worth of cuts this year from the budget.”This statement does not directly address the fact that councillors were told they would have to identify specific compensatory savings in order to keep the toilets open. The role of this specially-convened Place Scrutiny Committee was not to determine how the council’s overall budget should be balanced, but only to consider whether the Executive had acted properly in reaching its decision to close thirteen of the city’s public conveniences."

"content" : "When the Met Office moved to Exeter in 2003, climate change had already emerged as a major existential threat and the IPCC was increasingly sure that human activity was causing it. A 2005 conference hosted here examined the impacts of different levels of climate change and concluded (among other things) that the rate of emissions reduction needed to keep global temperatures to a level that would avoid the most serious consequences would rapidly increase the longer it was delayed.Following the Exeter conference, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change increased the mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reduction level to 80% by 2050 in the landmark 2008 UK Climate Change Act. Emissions from aviation and shipping were also included during the bill’s passage through parliament.At the time, opposition Conservatives and Liberal Democrats also supported the concept of a climate change bill, while proposing their own variations, and the Green Party wanted to go further, mandating a 90% cut by 2050 and setting interim annual targets.Meanwhile, the IPCC won a Nobel Peace Prize for its work on its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, which concluded that it was “very likely” (more than 90%) that most of global warming had anthropogenic causes, and the European Commission delivered binding legislation to implement its 20-20-20 targets.The 2014 Fifth Assessment Report increased the likelihood to 95-100% and laid the basis for the Paris Agreement, which committed 196 states to keep the increase in average global temperatures “well below” 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C as this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.Yet within little more than twelve months of signing the agreement the US announced its intention to withdraw and it began to emerge that none of the other major industrialised nations were meeting their emissions reduction pledges. It also became clear that even if they did, global temperatures would not remain below 2°C and would instead rise by 3°C or more.Climate Action Tracker June 2019 update. © Climate Analytics, Ecofys &amp;amp; NewClimate Institute.Then came the IPCC’s special report in October last year. Its key finding was that meeting a 1.5°C target remained possible “within the laws of chemistry and physics”, but would require drastic action to achieve “deep emissions reductions” via “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”.It also said that average global temperatures were likely to have risen by 1.5°C in as little as eleven years if warming continued to increase at the current rate, at which point there would be increased risks to “health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth”.Extinction Rebellion was launched less than a month later. By the end of November, thousands of people had blockaded London’s principal river bridges in protest at government failure to act more decisively and the international school strike for climate movement had begun, inspired by a Swedish teenager protesting outside her country’s parliament.Climate and the environment have since surged even higher up the political agenda, partly because of continuing protests and partly because of a series of publications from major organisations.In January the World Economic Forum said that extreme weather and climate change mitigation failure represent the planet’s greatest risks, warning that “the world is … sleepwalking into catastrophe”.In February an IPPR meta-study concluded that “the window of opportunity to avoid catastrophic outcomes in societies around the world is rapidly closing”. These include “economic instability, large-scale involuntary migration, conflict, famine and the potential collapse of social and economic systems”. A few days later the UK experienced its hottest ever winter day, ten degrees above average for the time of year.In April, Carbon Brief analysis revealed that children born this year will have lifetime carbon budgets 90% lower than those born in 1950 and a BBC climate change documentary reached millions of people just as renewed Extinction Rebellion activism in London reached its peak.In May, the UK government’s Committee on Climate Change confirmed the urgency of the need for the transition to net zero emissions and a UN Global Assessment Report said that human society was under urgent threat from the accelerating decline of Earth’s life-support systems.So far in June we have heard that last year’s increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide was the second highest in the past 60 years, that the first global study of plant extinctions found they are taking place at a rate around 500 times higher than before the industrial revolution, and that carbon emissions from the global energy sector are rising at the fastest rate since 2011.Unsurprisingly, public concern over these issues has reached record heights, particularly among young people, with two thirds of Britons now wanting urgent political action to tackle climate change and protect the natural world.Exeter Youth Strike 4 Climate at County HallSo when the first Youth Strike 4 Climate took place in Exeter on 15 February this year, some of the thousand or so school children and students who assembled at County Hall (the UK’s fourth largest turnout) might have felt reassured when Devon County Council declared its support for their aims.However, the county council had welcomed a £55 million government “funding injection” the day before, much of which is to be spent on roads, and less than a week later filleted a climate emergency motion proposed by Green Party councillor Jacqui Hodgson, removing most of its substance and all references to a 2030 deadline to shouts of “shame” from the public gallery.A similar motion proposed by Green Party councillor Chris Musgrave met with the same fate a week later at the hands of Exeter City Council, which removed all mention of a climate emergency altogether, using the word “ambition” four times to describe its position.Devon County Council subsequently convened a Devon Climate Emergency Response Group, which it said would “act now to tackle (the) climate emergency”, and backed a Devon Climate Declaration and the preparation of a Devon-wide Carbon Plan.However, it was then reported that the county council cabinet member for community, public health, transportation and environmental services said it could take around eighteen months to draft and adopt such a plan.Does the declaration contain an unambiguous commitment to decarbonise Devon, based on formal policy, with specific targets? It “sets out an ambition to tackle climate change that covers all of Devon” and proposes to “lead in the global response” but only promises to review signatory organisation carbon reduction plans and engage with residents, businesses and visitors to develop and implement yet more plans. Planning to do something is not the same as achieving it.More worryingly, the county’s chief executive, who is also chair of the climate emergency response group, seemed to say during an update at June’s cabinet meeting that collaborative “energy and enthusiasm” and “a lot of science” centred on “clean growth” and “green technology” would be sufficient to “make a real difference”, apparently not realising that successfully facilitating the kind of transformation entailed by decarbonising the county will depend more on persuasive political leadership than policy-making in committee.Two days later Devon County Council announced its support for an upgrade to the A303.South West strategic road network congestion. Photo by osde8info.Exeter City Council has, following its new leader’s U-turn on declaring a climate emergency, presented its approach to emissions reduction in a document authored by Exeter City Futures called Towards a Carbon Neutral Exeter.Unfortunately, this is another plan to make a plan, in this case based on twelve goals previously laid out by Exeter City Futures, none of which have a delivery date and only one of which has a meaningful measurement metric that would allow confirmation of its completion, and a 2017 Energy Independence report produced by Exeter-based City Science. The plan proposes the creation of three teams, one to research and plan, another to assess and endorse its outputs, and a third to help the first with its research.The 142 page energy independence report appears substantial at first sight, but important issues arise when it is used as a basis for statements made in the city’s proposals. They claim it “shows the technical feasibility of a zero carbon city” but it excludes the “energy used in the wider consumption footprint of the city, for example, foreign energy used and transportation energy that forms part of the existing food supply chain” in its energy independence definition. Neither aviation nor shipping are otherwise mentioned.The proposals also claim the energy independence report shows that finance is a particular barrier to emissions reduction, but its analysis does not give equal consideration to the three major barriers that it identifies.While it focusses considerable attention on technical barriers, and often discusses financial barriers, it frequently (perhaps understandably) passes over political barriers without giving them the attention their relevance deserves. The report also largely passes on the task of assessing how the region can reduce its transport emissions to a companion, as yet unreleased, study.The city council’s proposals also rely on a very cursory consideration of approaches to carbon reduction elsewhere as basis for the claim that “very few of these cities have to date set out clear, deliverable plans” to achieve their targets.It takes the recently-founded Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, which has only 19 city members, as its starting point instead of the long-established C40 cities network, which is comprised of 94 affiliated cities that between them account for 25% of global GDP and represent 1 in 12 people worldwide. Nine of the C40 cities have already passed and begun to implement detailed Paris Agreement-compatible action plans and 83 are committed to its Deadline 2020 programme, meaning they will pass and begin to implement such plans before the end of 2020.There are also significant exemplar cities (and whole countries) outside these international groupings which offer additional perspective on Exeter’s situation. One such is Rekjavik, which is the same size as Exeter while also being co-located with rich renewable energy resources, from which Iceland has been generating all its energy since 2012.Indeed, much can be learnt by comparing Exeter with other places which are leading the way. The single biggest elephant among a small herd to be found in this room, however, is that significant progress in other places has characteristically been enabled by entirely different governance and public finance arrangements from those in place here, typically with a single public authority determining and delivering across most or all relevant sectors.Exemplar cities outside the UK often also benefit from much greater decentralisation from national government, direct control over local taxation revenues and more generous funding support, as well as key utilities still being in public ownership. It is also clear that what has catalysed change in many of these places is political will.The city council’s proposals also overlook another significant issue, which is that many of these leading locations embraced change long ago, some as far back as the 1960s, when plenty of time was still available to build consensus for radical approaches that now need to be rushed.Exeter’s rapid economic and spatial development is already in conflict with the need to decarbonise. Should its enthusiasm for a new Ikea superstore have been tempered with a recognition that the 1.8 million shopping trips it generated in its first year, so many that its 1200-space car park cannot cope with demand on busy days, might undermine the city’s often-repeated “aim to be the global leader for addressing the challenges of climate change and urbanisation”?Copenhagen’s car-free streets &amp;amp; slow-speed zones by Streetfilms.The principal weakness of the approaches to decarbonisation that county and city are proposing, however, is that they require time we no longer have to devise the kind of action plans others began implementing long ago. Instead of continuing to procrastinate, we could actually get on with doing the things that we already know we need to do, at scale, based on successes elsewhere. Many of these are quick, cheap and popular (although some less so until after they’ve been implemented).Ongoing research and planning, especially for the really difficult and currently intractable challenges that lie ahead, such as decarbonising aviation, is obviously still necessary. But we do not need to spend months working out detailed methodologies for measuring baseline emissions in complex spatial contexts such as Exeter and its surrounding subregion in order to immediately increase the rate at which we reduce our carbon emissions.No-one needs to know the amount of carbon dioxide their car emits when they drive it to know that not to do so will mean it will emit none. Nor do they need expert insight to understand that catching the bus instead will be a better choice. Or that cycling or walking to and from their destination would be better still, if it is possible and other factors do not deter them.As Molly Scott Cato, recently re-elected as Green Party MEP for the South West, says: “What we have to do is everything we can as fast as we can: we already know what those things are. People have said they’re supporting the climate emergency, now they have to follow through.”Those who are not engaged in public policy-making (or holding those who make it to account) might not know what those things are, or have a detailed understanding of how we got to where we are, or how serious the consequences of not rapidly addressing the challenges we face might be.However, those who occupy leadership and senior decision-making and delivery positions, whether in the public, private or third sector, should already know. They should already be sufficiently familiar with the situation not to need to postpone action at the eleventh hour so as to spend the best part of the few remaining minutes before midnight forming an action plan. The clock will strike twelve much too soon for such prevarication.Warnings about climate change and its consequences have become increasingly insistent during the working lives of both city and county council leaders and their chief executives. All bar one have occupied influential positions at the most senior levels in the region since the milestone 2008 Climate Change Act, the other returning to Exeter politics three years later.Presuming they have all been aware of the work of the Met Office since it moved here in 2003, especially given how keen all are to promote Exeter’s “world-class reputation in climate and environmental research”, why have they not acted more decisively already?Local authority leaders and their officers typically direct this kind of question towards lack of financial or political support from higher-tier authorities in turn, whether or not both administrations are led by the same political party.Is additional government funding always necessary to enable change? Is government policy support always lacking? A glance at transport, the UK’s principal source of carbon emissions and Exeter’s most significant public policy challenge, suggests not.London ultra low emission clean air zonesIn 2015, the UK Supreme Court ordered ministers to take immediate action to cut air pollution. The resulting air quality plan failed to comply with the Supreme Court ruling or relevant EU Directives so ClientEarth, the law firm who brought the first action, went to the High Court and won again.The Department for Transport and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs responded with a revised air quality plan in 2017. The technical report on which this was based states that deterring polluting vehicles from city and town centres is by far the quickest, most cost-effective way to cut levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution. The same approach also decisively reduces motor vehicle carbon emissions and traffic congestion, enabling effective bus travel and supporting route expansion, improves road safety, enabling increased cycling levels, and transforms the public realm, enabling higher levels of walking. All of which combine to improve public health too.The clean air zones the government proposes in its plan are a variation on type of low emission zone that has been in force in London since 2008 and exists in more than 200 other towns and cities in Europe. Whole regions are included in such schemes in Italy. An ultra low emission zone has recently been introduced in central London, which will be expanded to include the whole of the area inside the North and South Circular roads from October next year. These zones are distinct from the London congestion charge area, which continues to operate in tandem with the zones.London’s ultra low emission zone has been an immediate success. In the first month of operation 9,400 fewer of the most polluting vehicles entered the zone each day compared with the previous month. There were 36,000 fewer of these vehicles than there had been in February 2017, when the zone was announced.Other UK cities are beginning to introduce similar zones, and Oxford is notably proposing a part-time zero emission zone in the city centre from 2020 which will incrementally increase its restrictions until a complete ban on all combustion engine vehicles will come into force in 2035.This is five years earlier than the government’s plan to ban the sale of such vehicles, but five years later than the Committee on Climate Change recommendation to phase them out. Hybrids will have to be included in the ban to reach the UK’s carbon reduction targets.Exeter, like Oxford, has a two tier local government structure that means the city’s transport strategy is decided and delivered by the county council. This arrangement creates problems on both sides, including that the Labour county councillors returned by most of the city have little influence over decisions made by Conservative county councillors returned by voters who live outside the city and depend on motor vehicles to access the its employment and leisure opportunities.As Exeter’s travel to work area has expanded to become the second largest in the UK (after Cambridge) inward commuting has risen fast. By the 2011 census 48% of the city’s workforce lived outside its borders: the figure is now likely to be much higher.However, air quality is a statutory responsibility for both city and county, so it presents an ideal opportunity for both to excel at the kind of collaborative partnership working they frequently extol.An Exeter clean air zone that starts as a part-time low emission measure from 2020, with managed exceptions to allow adaption by, for example, bus service operators, and gradually increases its scope and reach over ten years to a full ban on all non-zero emission vehicles by 2030 would constitute a carbon reduction partnership-defining act for both local authority tiers while supplying needed substance to Exeter’s leadership claims. Where does each currently stand?Exeter Queen Street mobility mode distribution. Image via Exeter Cycling Campaign.Devon County Council’s 2018 climate change strategy confirmed that the county’s carbon emissions come primarily from transport (agriculture produces the largest total greenhouse gas emissions) and focussed on potential emissions reductions from transport, buildings, energy and waste (following Committee on Climate Change guidance).However the county council can largely only indirectly facilitate improvements in buildings and energy at any scale, and only deals with waste disposal and not collection, so its principal impact potential is in its role as highways authority.It is therefore rather surprising to realise that neither the county’s climate change strategy, nor the University of Exeter review of the previous strategy on which it is based, nor indeed the recent Devon Climate Declaration mention either low emission or clean air zones, congestion charging or air quality once.At the same time, the city council’s 2018 air quality action plan only mentions congestion charging to say that the county council previously ruled it out “largely on cost grounds”, adding that a clean air zone is “seen as not sufficiently flexible to meet Exeter’s needs”.Exeter Green Party strongly criticised this plan, particularly on the basis of independent air quality analysis it had commissioned which showed that the city was much more polluted than suggested by council monitoring figures. It also criticised what it called the “misuse of data” from the plan consultation, which showed that 41% of nearly 3000 respondents supported a Workplace Parking Levy, with 34% opposed, on which basis the idea had been ruled out.A workplace parking levy scheme introduced by Nottingham City Council (a unitary authority) in 2012 had a “statistically significant impact on congestion” while generating annual revenues of £9 million which are reckoned to leverage a further three times as much investment, effectively bringing in £36 million each year.The money has helped fund tram extensions, support the bus network and introduce cycling schemes and has contributed to railway station redevelopment in the city. Hounslow, among other places, is considering a similar scheme which it estimates could raise £44 million to pay for new rail links in the area.In addition, Devon County Council’s 2019 Exeter transport strategy consultation, the outcome of which is expected in September, was based on a draft document that only mentioned vehicle emissions once and did not mention either low emission or clean air zones, congestion charging or climate change at all.Incredibly it did however say it aimed to “facilitate the increase of car-based inward commuters from outside the city”. There are no prizes for guessing it did not mention workplace parking levies. Neither the response from Exeter Green Party nor the city council left room for doubt that the county must make radical changes to its outlook.Extinction Rebellion at Oxford Circus. Photo by Mark Ramsay.Since Devon County Council decided against a congestion charging zone for Exeter, circumstances and public opinion have changed. An Exeter clean air zone supported by free park and rides at the furthest reach of all the city’s radials, like Oxford, would meet many important challenges the city faces head on without creating perceived economic injustice (as charge-based congestion zones can).A workplace parking levy, like Nottingham, would raise the revenue needed to pay for the clean air zone’s creation and administration, before gradually becoming obsolete as the zone incrementally increased vehicle access restrictions.Busy park and rides would offer their own one-stop service revenue-raising opportunities while many non-retail businesses that currently require freight servicing inside the zone will move to the other side of the M5 as Marsh Barton and Sowton are redeveloped for housing too.These would be the sticks to accompany the nudge theory-based carrots that the county council employs to avoid grappling with collective action problems by “encouraging” individual people to change their behaviour instead.The evidence from successful motor vehicle use reduction schemes elsewhere is that nudges won’t work without the disincentives supplied by the sticks, but as the city’s air quality action plan consultation confirmed that large majorities back the reduction of private car use, the expansion of park and ride sites and think that air quality should be treated as a public health priority, shaking these particular sticks should not prove electorally onerous.Why is serious consideration of such a combined scheme absent from the county’s climate change strategy and climate declaration and dismissed in passing in the city’s air quality action plan, when government policy and technical evidence support it so strongly? Why would the county’s transport strategy consultation draft propose to “facilitate the increase of car-based inward commuters from outside the city” when Exeter residents already pay for such change with polluted air, congested streets, damaged public realm and loss of land to car parking despite choosing to walk and cycle instead of drive themselves?A willingness to reconsider existing interventions that have been effective elsewhere and committed leadership to promote their viability and value is needed to address these questions.Groningen: the world’s cycling city by Streetfilms.No doubt many will need time to adjust to the idea of a zero emission zone coming into force in Exeter, just as they may to accept that emissions from all combustion engine vehicles whose movement centres on the city, including buses, trains and aircraft, as well as the emissions from its consumption supply chain must all be included in the city’s transport carbon footprint. And so reduced to net zero in just over a decade on current plans. It is striking, if unsurprising, that the impact of Exeter airport is currently absent from most discussions of the issue, including the city’s ostensibly progressive zero carbon proposals.However many minor low-cost interventions are possible that multiply over time to bring stakeholders with them as public opinion moves from sceptical to convinced. Pontevedra (in Galicia, where it rains a lot too) has reduced motor traffic by 97% over ten years with such tactics. It used to have about the same number of cars travelling through it each day as Exeter does now.Amsterdam has begun implementing a plan to replace 10,000 on-street car parking spaces in the city centre with play areas, bike lanes and community container gardens. This is about the same number of car parking spaces that Exeter has now. The city has also pledged to ban petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.Dutch women are already 80 times more likely to cycle than British women because their streets are so different to ours, a figure which is set to rise. Retailers benefit everywhere such schemes are introduced.Exeter Cycling Campaign produced a detailed modal filtering and rat-running prevention analysis at the county council’s request in 2017, which contained multiple low-cost recommendations that would make a significant cumulative impact, none of which have so far been implemented. It has also since produced a report listing almost 150 minor improvements that would enhance access to walking and cycling across the city.It is about time the county council recognised the value that these crowdsourced efforts represent by following through with action. It is also time it produced the Local Cycling &amp;amp; Walking Infrastructure Plan it was asked for in the government’s 2017 Cycling &amp;amp; Walking Investment Strategy on which future related funding depends.Simply closing roads to motor traffic costs almost nothing yet has major impact, instantly transforming urban space. Even single road closure helps a little, even if only on a single day, especially when such days occur regularly so people become accustomed to the change.Edinburgh’s recent decision to join the Open Streets movement has not only been prompted by the desire to create better public realm in the often-congested city. And London has just announced its largest car-free day to date, when more than twelve miles of roads will close.Repurposing a couple of hundred yards of Magdalen Road for a Sunday afternoon street party is welcome, but it doesn’t go nearly far enough. Car-free Sundays every weekend inside the old city walls and play streets in every area of the city would be more like it: these are what catalysed the Netherlands’ subsequent transformation in the 1970s.Shared streets are well-established elsewhere, there is no reason why they should not be here too. A few planters are all you need to start.Amsterdam to remove 10,000 parking spaces by Streetfilms.Where highways authorities do choose to prioritise spending on cycling and walking infrastructure, modal shift soars. Unfortunately, Devon County Council is currently only allocating 7% of its highways capital spending budget to cycling schemes, just over £2 million, most of which is spent on leisure routes and not interventions that will help commuters leave their cars at home. This is less than half the 15% called for by the government in 2018.Meanwhile, many millions are being spent on roads in and around Exeter. The A380 Kingkerswell bypass cost £110 million, excluding the 800 compensation claims from those living nearby   it has since generated because the road has reduced the value of their homes. The A361 North Devon link road scheme is a £93 million project to widen a five mile stretch from Barnstaple to South Molton.£55 million is to be spent on infrastructure to support housing development in South West Exeter between Alphington Village and Exminster, which will include widening the A379, upgrading roundabouts and realigning existing roads. £13 million is being spent on improving the A382 between Forches Cross and Newton Abbot, and a proposed new road between the A382 and A383 through the Houghton Barton development area near Newton Abbot will further extend the scheme.Widening Bridge Road in Exeter cost £5.3 million, redeveloping the A379 Newcourt junction cost £2.3 million, junction improvements at Moor Lane roundabout are to cost £2.2 million and £3 million is to be spent widening Long Lane near Exeter airport to support the development of a new 17 acre business park and “the future growth of the airport”.A new scheme to upgrade the A379 is likely to cost £25 million alongside another half a billion pounds of proposed road spending across the South West. Improved journey times and road safety are offered as primary justification for almost all these projects.Compare all this with the long-delayed Marsh Barton railway station, which was originally due to open in 2016 but now may never be built. Then consider the phenomenon known as induced demand and its application to transport, observed for the first time as long ago as 1925 and repeatedly demonstrated in numerous authoritative studies since: one might paraphrase it as “building roads to cure congestion is an exercise in futility”.It should come as no surprise, then, that despite all this spending, Exeter still has the slowest moving roads in the country.Improving public transport is unavoidably necessary in and around the city. Doing so would also dramatically improve our poor productivity. However, it will only result in reduced congestion (with all the attendant benefits outlined above) if other drivers are prevented from filling the space created by more people using buses and trains. No matter how else we might hope to address Exeter’s transport problems, we will only succeed by removing cars from the city’s roads.In fact, they will already be free of combustion engine vehicles by 2030 if it meets its proposed decarbonisation deadline, unless the ambiguous statements in the city council’s proposals about “framing” Exeter’s emissions reductions target to link with (later) wider regional targets are intended to allocate the impact of the traffic that floods into city every day from outside to other local authorities, or to pass responsibility on for the traffic that starts in the city and heads to employment sites outside its boundaries.While the incremental introduction of a zero emissions zone around Exeter’s edges over the next ten years may seem absurdly ambitious to some, it represents low hanging fruit compared with some of the branches we will need to reach to reduce the city’s carbon footprint to zero by 2030.Unless we are to accept the farcical prospect of commuters with combustion engines driving into and through Exeter for the following twenty years, which would be commensurate with current county council and government plans (petrol and diesel cars will still be on sale to 2040), we must begin reclaiming the city’s streets now with the means that are already available.Life on a Dutch Living Street by Streetfilms.One might wonder, then, why Devon County Council persists in allocating its strategic transport resources without this purpose in mind, let alone its additional £54 million highways maintenance budget. As above, its leaders and their officers typically direct this question towards the higher-tier authority in turn.The Conservative government’s record on transport policy is lamentable. Since the party won a majority in 2015 it has decided to spend £14 billion extending Heathrow airport, which will require the construction of nearly 50,000 car parking spaces. It has scrapped mainline railway electrification projects and has overseen a year on year fall of 85 million bus passenger journeys to the lowest levels since records began. It has even decided to scrap a cycleway that was planned alongside the HS2 route which would have delivered a return on investment up to five times greater than the rail project itself.It has continued to promote the value of electric cars despite them doing nothing to address congestion while still producing significant environment impact (including toxic emissions) and depending on increasingly scarce minerals for their production. There are currently only around 200,000 electric vehicles in the UK, so tens of millions of existing cars will need to be replaced, but the charging infrastructure that will be required to supply them is in short supply and needs rapid expansion as well as investment in additional energy production capacity to the tune of well over £100 billion. It has scrapped subsidies for hybrid vehicle purchases and reduced those for all-electric cars, leading to slower take-up, and more than a quarter of local authorities have stopped adding charging points after funding cuts to council budgets.The government’s energy record is just as bad. It scrapped the feed-in tariff on the basis it would reduce annual household electricity bills, but then admitted it might only save customers 50p a year. In the month after the scheme closed, May 2019, the number of home solar panel installations fell by 94% and the sector’s union reported that there had been a 30% drop in renewable energy jobs between 2014 and 2017. It also cancelled subsidies for onshore wind despite it being the cheapest source of energy in the UK and has effectively blocked all new onshore installations despite consistent support from three-quarters of the public (including those living near turbines).It has promoted fracking proposals that would emit the same amount of carbon dioxide as 300 million new cars despite the High Court ruling that it had failed to consider their impact on climate change and has recently been rebuked by its own environmental audit committee for spending millions of pounds on subsidising fossil fuel-burning projects abroad.In addition it has not only scrapped plans inherited from the previous Labour government to make all new homes zero carbon from 2016 but also its own flagship “green deal” home insulation scheme despite poorly-insulated UK housing stock being among the most expensive to heat in Europe. It won’t even introduce a 1p per item tax on fast fashion to help clean up its enormous environmental impact despite a trade survey showing that 69% of the industry support the charge.Unsurprisingly, there has been a marked slowdown in UK carbon emissions reduction rates after easy early gains made by closing coal-fired power stations, and some sector emissions are rising. Even though it took place after the first UK school strike, parliament’s first debate on climate change in two years was only attended by a handful of MPs. A few more MPs were present when the Labour Party then used an opposition day motion to declare a (non-legally binding) climate emergency the day before the local elections took place, but the motion only passed because the government chose not to oppose it and not because of a decisive vote.When Theresa May subsequently amended the 2008 Climate Change Act (by statutory instrument, also not entailing a vote) to commit the UK to net zero emissions by 2050, she explicitly ruled in the use of carbon credit offsets, ignoring Committee on Climate Change recommendations to the contrary, failed to mention the overdue inclusion of aviation or shipping in carbon budgets and allowed a five year “get-out” clause which would give the UK the option to abandon the target if other countries do not take similar action.This week’s announcement that a citizen’s assembly on climate change will take place this autumn is similarly evasive: predictably, its findings will not be binding. And those who have been demanding it might wonder whether it will take place at all under the new Conservative Prime Minister. Both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson’s leadership campaigns have been funded by a company linked to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a major climate science denial group.Heathrow airport. Photo by Sebastian Grochowicz.So while local government officers may claim they are simply doing what they are told, as non-partisan professionals, or explain that funding has been redirected towards other government policy priorities, such as from the highways budget to the Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership, it is very difficult to see how county councillors elected on a Conservative Party policy platform can credibly claim to be determined to tackle the climate crisis when their party’s record looms over them and more than a quarter of their prospective new leader’s supporters want to see less emphasis on the issue.Nor can Labour city councillors claim an unimpeachable party record: its members voted for Heathrow airport expansion, backed the new deep coal mine in Cumbria and contracted the felling of thousands of trees in Sheffield. Bizarrely, Exeter City Council this week introduced free car parking which will encourage more driving in the city centre on Thursday evenings, then led a clean air promotion the next day with “transport is by far the largest contributor to air pollution”.The leadership challenges that are entailed by the climate crisis need so much more than the business as usual approach that is being adopted at city and county level. If we take the recent local council and European Parliament elections as a guide, it would seem as if Devon’s residents agree. Across the eight districts overseen by Devon County Council, the Conservatives lost nearly 44% of the local council seats they previously held, losing control of Teignbridge, East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon and Torridge district councils and sustaining reduced majorities in West Devon and South Hams. They also performed badly in the European elections, losing between 23.8% and 28.7% of their vote share across the districts, typically coming in fourth or fifth place.Labour also fared poorly in Exeter, where it runs the city council. Its vote was down 22.5% from the 2018 local elections and it came fourth in the European elections, down 15.2%, in a result which saw the Greens come within less than a percentage point of beating the insurgent Brexit Party.The Liberal Democrats gained seats on every district council, doing well in some areas with independent candidates doing well in others, one notably in Exeter. Greens now have seats in every district authority area except Teignbridge, with Exeter’s lead Green Party candidate received more votes than anyone else standing in the city.However you interpret these results, there is no doubt that the political landscape is in flux at every level. With soaring public concern about the environment on one flank and unwavering Brexit support on the other, the Conservative Party’s electoral woes are likely to continue in the May 2021 county council elections, especially as thousands of currently disenfranchised young people across the county who care passionately about climate change will be voting for the first time.And while the voting by thirds electoral cycle in Exeter makes it virtually impossible for the currently dominant Labour group to lose power at the next round of elections in 2019, and the following year will be fallow while the county elections are held, the odds on further Exeter Labour vote losses will shorten as the Clifton Hill sports centre site comes up for sale, the financial folly known as St Sidwell’s Point rises from the ground opposite the council’s offices and the city’s streets continue to fill with traffic.Exeter Youth Strike 4 Climate leave a message for Devon County Council at County HallFor city, county and country, the challenge is the same. How can a nation that has failed to deal with significant structural problems for the better part of half a century transform itself into a progressive, prosperous social democracy in which the everyday lives of its people match the rhetoric of its leaders?Even courageous honesty about how ill-prepared we are to make the transition to a just, zero carbon society would help: the scale of the transformation that is required is far greater than the changes wrought by Thatcherism. But like the student climate network activist who asked a clutch of Conservative leadership candidates whether they would commit to the action necessary to tackle climate change on television on Tuesday night, all we get are platitudes.Instead, we should be going much further than mere ambition to do the bare minimum, especially if Exeter’s global climate change leadership aspirations are to be borne out on the ground. We should be including other important considerations, such as global economic and social justice and the historic impacts of the British empire and industrial revolution, in expertly-informed decisions about how we definitively decarbonise sooner rather than later.

In the same way as wealthy people have little excuse for their environmental impact because they have more choice over how to live, wealthy places have greater responsibility to make faster and deeper carbon emissions cuts so poorer places get more time to manage change with fewer resources.The challenge for those in leadership positions in such places is that they must act immediately to enable carbon emissions reductions that are as rapid and as comprehensive as is technically feasible, not procrastinate because of perceived cost or political timidity. To ask for more time to plan future change that is needed now is to acknowledge that they don’t already know what to do. But they have already had plenty of time to understand the challenges entailed by climate change and to learn how to meet them.If they either do not understand the facts of the matter or the urgency of the situation, or prefer to fiddle while the planet burns for fear of repercussions from decisions they must take for all our sakes, they should ask themselves whether they are cut out for leadership roles in the circumstances we face. There are others who do know what to do and want to act now.In any case, as climate change activists from an earlier era used to say, we are more possible than they can powerfully imagine."

We have adopted the IMPRESS Standards Code and a new complaints policy, which includes a whistleblowing policy to which all employees and contributors are required to adhere. These new arrangements can be viewed on our corrections and complaints page.IMPRESS was created in response to the findings of the 2011-2012 Leveson Inquiry, a judicial public inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press which was established in the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal.The Leveson Report recommended that a new independent press regulation body be established to replace the Press Complaints Commission, which closed in 2014. The regulatory body was to be recognised in law but Prime Minister David Cameron, under whose direction the inquiry had been established, declined to enact the requisite legislation.The PCC was replaced by the virtually indistinguishable, and also voluntary, Independent Press Standards Organisation which is owned and controlled by the very newspapers it is supposed to regulate. Campaign group Hacked Off, which did much to expose the phone hacking scandal, says IPSO is “not fit for purpose” and the National Union of Journalists has called it a “pointless so-called regulator”.Several broadsheet newspapers including the Financial Times, The Independent and The Guardian declined to take part in IPSO and established their own independent complaints systems instead.The Press Recognition Panel was nevertheless created in 2014 by the Royal Charter on self-regulation of the press to recognise press regulators. In 2016 IMPRESS became the UK’s first press regulator recognised this way, and has remained the only body so far approved by the PRP. Its recognition was supported by the National Union of Journalists."

"content" : "Despite government announcements about the end of “austerity”, Exeter City Council has to decide how to reduce its running costs by £2.4 million this year if it is to comply with its legal obligation to produce a balanced budget for 2020/21. The ruling Labour group’s manifesto for the May 2019 local elections gave no indication about how the spending cuts would be made.There is significant public interest not only in what services will be reduced, but in the process the council will adopt in identifying them. Will a list be drawn up by officers from which councillors will be unable to deviate, or will there be open debate and some form of engagement with residents about where savings can be made and perhaps new revenue-raising avenues identified?Exeter City Council said that despite its central government funding being cut from £12.1 million in 2010/11 to £4.4 million in 2019/20, it has managed to maintain one of the lowest council tax rates in England. In relation to preparation of the 2020/21 budget, for which the £2.4 million cuts need to be identified, a council spokesperson said:“Staff are currently working on early budget proposals in conjunction with elected members, portfolio holders, the Leader of the Council and Chief Executive. These high-level discussions are either emerging, or have yet to take place. They will then be working across the summer to identify how to deliver a balanced budget.”“There are many reasons why this remains a fluid figure right up to the April 2020 deadline. Depending on the nature of budget proposals, consultations would take place from the autumn as they did last year, for example, on toilet closures and community grants. Over the past five years staff numbers have reduced by over 100 whilst most public facing services have continued alongside taking on additional work, such as helping to try to solve congestion.”Exeter City Council public toilet closure at Blackboy RoadThe council’s consultation over toilet closures bears some scrutiny. In order to balance the books for the current budget year thirteen of the city’s council-run public toilets were closed on 29 April 2019. The sequence of events leading to the closures ran as follows:15 January 2019: Councillors on the Executive approve a public consultation on proposals to close a list of thirteen public toilets, half of all those in Exeter. No equalities impact assessment is made available at the meeting.17 January 2019: Place Scrutiny Committee is asked to approve a draft budget for the year beginning April 2019. The budget line for public conveniences shows a proposed increase of £170,670 with an explanation in the accompanying commentary. Only the very small print of Appendix 2 reveals that the figure includes an annual spending cut of £65,000.February 2019: A web-based consultation runs for a period of three weeks. It is less a consultation than a user survey, and limited to toilets targeted for closure. There are 526 responses, which officers describe as “relatively few”, although the 400 people who attended a 2015 consultation exhibition on the plans for a new leisure complex were deemed by the council to constitute popular support for what is now the £51.8 million St Sidwell’s Point project.26 February 2019: Full Council approves the budget for 2019/20, which includes the £65,000 spending cut “subject to consultation”.9 April 2019: Executive receives a report on the outcome of the consultation including a recommendation to confirm the closure plan. The spending cut has been reduced to £60,000. The report also highlights the fact that 62% of respondents used the “any additional comments” box to object to the closures, and now includes an equalities impact assessment which spells out in detail the impact of the closures on the population groups particularly at risk of urinary incontinence. Executive confirms the closure plans.26 April 2019: A special meeting of Place Scrutiny Committee is held, following a requisition from opposition councillors to “call in” Executive’s decision to close the toilets. The call-in of an executive decision by a scrutiny committee is highly unusual, reflecting the strength of public and political feeling on the issue.Exeter City Council public toilet closure at Whipton Village, Pinhoe RoadThe call-in debate was the first time the issue had been discussed by a wide range of councillors in a public forum, so it is worth noting some key points:The committee chair, Councillor Luke Sills (Labour) told members that they would have to find equivalent savings elsewhere in the already-agreed budget if they wanted to reverse Executive’s decision. Some councillors sitting in the public seats who were not members of the committee commented in stage whispers that the chair was out of order since there was no requirement in the council’s standing orders for such a stipulation.Conservative, Green and Liberal Democrat councillors then made a series of pertinent practical points about problems faced by people who need to stop off at a toilet when travelling across the city by bus (and indeed by bus drivers themselves), as well as the difficulties faced by homeless people.They argued that the community toilets option floated by the council, under which shops and other suitable businesses would allow their toilets to be used by the public, should have been implemented before the closures, though the lack of interest shown by businesses in this idea suggested that this might not be viable.Councillor Olwen Foggin (Labour) broke ranks by declaring that she had not gone into politics to close essential public services before offering two options for raising compensatory revenue, both ignored by the committee.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Responses from lead councillor David Harvey (Labour) and the Director of Place, David Bartram, relied heavily on three points. First, that councils were required to carry out an equalities impact assessment and to note the results, but were not obliged to act on its findings even when there were negative consequences. The financial pressures on the council were sufficient to justify setting aside the impact assessment.Second, that the police were supportive of the closures as a means of reducing anti-social behaviour. Devon and Cornwall Police subsequently said: “We are supportive of plans from Exeter City Council to close public toilets linked to drug use, and we will continue to tackle anti-social behaviour in and around the city.”The council’s proposals identified six of the thirteen to be closed as having problems with drugs use: Blackboy Road, Ennerdale Way, Fore Street Heavitree, King William Street, Musgrave Row and Okehampton Street. All but three of the rest were reported as suffering from vandalism and other anti-social behaviour.Third, that there was no incentive to make community toilets available as long as the existing council-run toilets remained open. Officers would pursue a more targeted approach to businesses in response to the change.No plans were offered for what would happen to the sites of the closed toilets, or for the costs of necessary maintenance in the period until disposal. Officers had been tasked to explore options.A Labour member then proposed that since the committee was not in a position to identify alternative budget savings, it had no option but to take no further action in response to Executive’s decision. All five Labour hands went up, and that was it.The toilets have now been closed.Exeter City Council public toilet closure at Higher CemeteryWe report this series of events in detail because it represents to a major wrangle over a relatively minor sum. How shall much larger cuts amounting to £2.4 million be identified and agreed? Should there be greater public engagement earlier in the decision-making process, when there is still time for further consultation and revision?Green Party councillor Diana Moore, who was elected last month with a commitment to supporting greater dialogue between the council and communities, argues that the whole process for setting budgets should be more transparent, with opportunities for everyone to influence them before they are finalised by councillors.She said: “The city council now faces really difficult choices about how to achieve a balanced budget. A small group of councillors and officers, however able, cannot think of everything. Labour need to explain the cuts they are planning to the public early, and it makes sense to go out and invite ideas from residents and businesses about how to tackle these financial problems. We need a council which is willing to draw on the skills, expertise and ideas of residents.“Participatory budgeting is an established democratic technique for engaging people in decisions on how public money is spent. It has been used by several councils including Newcastle, Southampton and Tower Hamlets, and there is no good reason why it cannot be done in Exeter.“Any well-designed approach to seeking community views on council spending would help people understand the financial pressures the council is under and why it takes the decisions it does.”It remains to be seen whether Exeter City Council will act on these ideas or whether it will repeat the approach it has taken with the closure of public toilets.Meanwhile, out on the streets the consequences of the closures are already evident. As the author was photographing a recently-closed convenience in respectable Whipton, a man approached, rattled on the doors, saw the sign and stated for all to hear: “I’ll have to do it on the grass, then.”  And he did."

"content" : "Sir Thomas Dyke Acland stands proud beside the Roman wall in Northernhay Gardens, a century and a half after his death. The inscription on his statue pays tribute to his “generous heart and open hand, which have been ever ready to protect the weak, to relieve the needy, and to succour the oppressed”.Five figures approach the statue in line, dressed in black utility-style clothing and matching communist caps. They assemble in formation and draw red ping-pong paddles from tool belts, displaying them against their chests. Turning, they look up towards four similarly-clad figures who have appeared at the top of the wall. They lift their paddles in the air as if in salute.A paddle raised in reply signals the division of the ground crew into two. They stand legs astride and with arms outstretched, seeming to anticipate action. A whistle sounds and a long roll of bright red serge fabric is unfurled from the top of the wall. It is suspended against the wall for several moments before being dropped to the ground in a crumpled heap.The serge is gathered then pulled taut before two of the figures begin to carefully roll the cloth into a tight wind. The wall crew arrive and all engage in smoothing out creases and kinks, picking at lint, fussing over their task. They take turns, wordless and workmanlike, occasionally pausing to survey their progress. Finally, the tightly wound roll is hoisted onto shoulders and all the figures depart.Preston Street Union present SERGE/SURGE at Cricklepit MillWe just witnessed a performance of SERGE/SURGE by Preston Street Union, a group of Exeter-based artists formed in 2015. The piece was performed four times over the course of an afternoon in different locations around the city walls.For the second performance we head to the footpath below Yaroslavl Bridge, halfway down to the quay. Tourists, dog walkers and passers-by stop to stare; some stand back, reluctant to stride past the action. When the whistle blows and the serge tumbles, because the wall here is shorter than before, the fabric rolls out across the grass, resembling a red carpet laid out for distinguished visitors.A seldom-used footpath overlooking Cricklepit Mill is the site of the third performance. The confined space brings performers and audience closer together, as if participating in a piece of street theatre. We return to Northernhay Gardens for the final performance which, this time, takes place below the highest point of the castle wall. The ramparts here are toweringly tall. When the serge unfurls it brings to mind the image of a conquering army hanging their banners on newly-captured city walls.The serge is then loosely gathered and lifted onto the shoulders of five of the figures, who parade past the onlookers to the conclusion of the performance. Trays of Exeter puddings, from a recipe by Mrs Beeton, are presented on a white tablecloth embroidered with the words “generous heart and open hand” in red thread. Audience, not performers, tuck in.Preston Street Union present SERGE/SURGE at Northernhay Gardens. Photo: RAMMPreston Street Union say these four performance sites roughly correspond with compass points. Options for sites were limited by many of the remaining sections of Roman wall being inaccessible as they sit on private land or beside car parks. The group’s focus on the complex history of Exeter’s walls is a response to RAMM’s 2019 migration theme, which is the basis of the commission brief.The group was given special access to RAMM’s collections by the museum’s curators to enable the development of the piece. This led its members to consider Exeter’s historic wool trade, which brought many skilled migrants to the city from the fifteenth century to its peak in the eighteenth century. The group became interested in North American artefacts in the museum’s collection which contained fragments of red woollen cloth produced in the South West.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            How did these pieces of fabric, which were originally intended for military uniforms, make it across the Atlantic? RAMM say they were traded to build relationships with indigenous peoples. According to Preston Street Union, they ultimately became incentives for the surrender of ancestral land to colonisers. Exeter’s walls similarly represent the capture and enclosure of indigenous land by foreign invaders. People and traded goods may have later flowed through these walls, but they were actually built to keep people out.Hostile reaction to migrants is often expressed in describing their arrival as “surges”. They nevertheless bring demonstrable economic and cultural benefits. Preston Street Union presents the serge cloth that was largely responsible for Exeter’s historic wealth, much of which was created by skilled migrants, as a symbol that represents many things for the city. Not only can it do duty as a welcoming red carpet, it also signifies a metaphorical breach of the city walls, as well as a bridge across them that connects people inside with those without.Preston Street Union proposes serge as a symbol for migration that is specific to Exeter. Like Thomas Acland’s dyed-in-the-wool establishment outlook, it has much to say about both the city’s present and past.SERGE/SURGE was the first part of a two stage work commissioned by RAMM and supported by the Arts Council. The second part is due this autumn."

"content" : "Exeter’s youth eco-activist movement burst onto the city’s streets in February 2019 when a thousand children, students and young people gathered at County Hall.We were inspired by sixteen-year-old Greta Thunberg’s protests, which began outside the Swedish parliament the previous summer and had already seen her berate the world’s political leaders for behaving like children at the United Nations climate conference in December.We occupied a platform beside the council’s offices. Our spontaneous speeches flurried in the air. Council workers flocked at their windows, probably wondering what force had suddenly reclaimed (I’d like to say rewilded) County Hall’s grounds.We were met by the bizarre spectacle of Devon County Council leader John Hart explaining to the assembled crowd that without oil there can be no water.In response, the crowd became fluent. We flooded the air not with the fossilized language of business as usual but with the crystal clarity of truth.Underneath the fervent chanting lay something darker: children as young as five voicing fears of wildlife loss, weather storms and air that is impossible to breathe.We’re no longer letting such fears daunt or silence us. We’re using them for collective fuel, co-ordinating together behind a set of four clear demands.Photo: Martin RedfernDemand 1: The government declares a climate emergency and implements a Green New DealA climate emergency has now been declared, but back in February it was our simplest call. It echoed through the streets, linking us all beyond the invisible boundaries of friendship groups, united by the need for urgent action.The hum of change rang everywhere. Girls carried heavy speakers; boys expressed their fears in speech and song. Stereotypes ebbed away and all the usual ways of defining people dissolved.Together we swept onto Exeter’s high street, surging down it like a great wave, the most fluid disruption I’ve ever seen.As we took over the tarmac, people stood and stared. Some put down their coffee cups and left cafes to clap. I remember a bus driver leaning out of the window to join us in a chant.Chain store facades crumbled as we broke the advertisers’ spell and shop window mannequins cheered us along our way. For a long, liberating moment the call for climate justice captured the mood of the high street.Sometimes it’s not frustration and anger that lies at the fringes of our disruption. Sometimes we seem to expose everyone’s yearning for something to change.Now, four months on, things no longer seem so simple. It was easy for the councils to say they recognised the emergency. We thought that would mean they would do something about it.But Devon refused to commit to a 2030 zero carbon deadline and Exeter removed all five references to a climate emergency in the watered-down motion they passed.Photo: Tom KingsnorthDemand 2: The government communicates the severity of the ecological crisis and the necessity to act now to the general publicWhen, in March, we arrived at Exeter City Council’s door, it seemed no-one inside would meet us at its threshold. The tidal wave of the crowd had reached the flood barrier of local government.Shouting drowned out Rachel Sutton, the council’s deputy leader, as she emerged to tell us that the council had installed solar panels, not on every home in the city, but on its own offices.There’s no doubt her intentions were good, but we don’t have time for surface fixes. We need our government, local and national, and that means all our MPs, to take action which addresses the climate crisis at its core.Outside the civic centre one school striker, Natasha Pavey, read an open letter we’d written to those in authority:“The scale of this transition is huge, but so is our ability to change. We have seen rapid transitions before - in the second world war the entire economy was focused on fighting the threat of the day.“If the threat is great the response must be proportionate. We need change now!”Photo: Tom KingsnorthDemand 3: The Government recognises that young people have the biggest stake in our future by lowering the voting age to 16Natasha then read out our demands, making clear that we were serious, had specific aims and were setting the agenda for change.Sometimes we must make people in power feel uncomfortable. At others we must become that power: the ceaseless cry of a future which cannot remain a void in which the waste of the present is dumped.Taking part in the youth strikes has changed the way we see the future. People who will inhabit the planet thirty years from now must be heard in the decisions that are made today.We need the vote at sixteen to embed our voices in law. We speak for both present and future: decisions that include us will never be submerged by short-term economic interests but will instead rise to the responsibilities required by the climate crisis.But both city and county council prefer to tell us what they’ve already done: the fantastic achievements of the past. Our campaign is called Fridays For Future for a reason.Photo: Vanessa MilesDemand 4: The national curriculum is reformed to address the ecological crisis as an educational priorityThe school curriculum seems designed without active citizenship in mind, piling tests on students so it becomes impossible to swim against the current of continuous examination.Besides airbrushing over the real, raw human effects of the climate crisis - the upheaval of coastal towns, intense migration, the potential for famine - schools do little to encourage us to act, less still to act collectively.This month Isca Academy tried to prevent pupils from leaving the school by barricading the doors with chairs. One escapee told the crowd at the strike that they “pressed the exit button and ran for it”.There is no space for activism within our schools, no space to display a sense of citizenship that goes beyond the bake sale.At our strikes in April and May we did the opposite, reclaiming Bedford Square and forming a natural stage by sitting down to listen to speeches. Chalk was shared amongst the crowd, kids covered the ground with their messages.We filled the centre of the high street with a chalk crime scene outlining the corpses of the first human victims of climate breakdown: kids.Photo: Vanessa MilesThe hopes and dreams of young people are being battered as the stories we were read as children collide with the reality beyond our windows.We ache and yearn not just for a future free of geopolitical scares and rising seas, but for one which is wild and free and alive.Rather than trying to pour oil on troubled waters, we must treat the climate crisis like the crisis it is.The fifth Exeter Youth Strike 4 Climate will take place on Friday 21 June.More information: Fridays for Future Exeter, Youth Strike 4 Climate and UK Student Climate Network."

"content" : "Jazz is a live music, to be spoken and given away on that day. As Max Roach said, “It comes out of a communal experience. We take our respective instruments and collectively create a thing of beauty.”The Jambassadors, an Exeter College Music Academy student ensemble, channel this spirit to make music together that sounds like them and all the things they are.On Thursday 6 June at Exeter’s Barnfield Theatre The Jambassadors will be digging deep into improvisation to explore modern jazz-rooted music in varying experimental shapes and forms.They will be topping the fifth slice of Jazz Toast, which first popped-up in 2014 as a performance jam at an established Exeter College student gig and has since evolved into an independent celebration of youth music at its most creative and dynamic.The Jambassadors. Photo: Gabe RiedlingerPlaying live is vital for students of music to find their sounds and take their improvisation to a level which only happens with an audience in the room.At Jazz Toast we treat any sheets of music we have as pages of ideas: starting places to be treasured or ignored. Our setlist of textures and ideas includes music by John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Melt Yourself Down alongside original student compositions and freely experimental pieces set to the theme of dreams.We will discover how the music unfolds on the night. We have used our rehearsals to forge a group who can create music together no matter what happens (or doesn’t). Once it begins, we are off!There will be surprises for the band as I announce previously unseen improvisation directives. There will be surprises from the band as student compositions are aired. And there will be surprises for the audience as everyone in the Clifford Room collectively creates our musical environment.

These student musicians are only together for a single academic year. Listening to them pour their personalities into improvised music is inspiring and life-affirming.And when one member of the band unexpectedly dresses up as a horse with a hat for the photo shoot, and lengthy discussions take place over whether cushions and tap shoes are needed for the gig, it becomes clear that this space for free self-expression is working its magic.As Charlie Haden said, “I want them to come away discovering the music inside them. And not thinking about themselves as jazz musicians, but thinking about themselves as good human beings, striving to be a great person.”Jambassadors performances are an exciting celebration of creativity where music meets humanity and anything can happen.Jazz Toast featuring The Jambassadors is at 7.30pm on Thursday 6 June 2019 in the Clifford Room at Barnfield Theatre.

"content" : "Matthew MacKisack invites you to close your eyes, then to picture the Eiffel Tower. What can you see? Can you pick out the metal struts, follow the line of the tower’s elegant silhouette, grasp the way it stands proud against the Paris skyline? How vivid is the image in your mind’s eye?An air of quiet concentration falls over the group gathered for a tour of RAMM’s Extreme Imagination exhibition. Standing back, my mind races through myriad images: memories of visits, recollections of photographs and film, Zazie playing with the laws of physics among its girders.MacKisack interrupts my reverie. Who can see nothing at all? A few people raise their hands. It seems they have a little-known condition called aphantasia and possess no mind’s eye.La descente vertigineuse de Charles from Zazie dans le métroThis “blindness of the mind” is not new: it was first described in the late 19th century. Following decades of disinterest, study of the phenomenon was revived in 2005 by the University of Exeter’s Professor Adam Zeman, and has identified wide variations in imaginative ability.New terms are now in use: aphantasia affects around two or three of every hundred people. Hyperphantasia, at the other end of the imaginative spectrum, is found in around 10 to 15 percent of the population. My manic internal Eiffel Tower memory movie appears to place me firmly in this latter group.Studies of the neural basis of visual imagination and its role in culture have now taken place - and provided the basis for this exhibition.Curated by MacKisack and artist Susan Aldworth, Extreme Imagination surveys a selection of aphantasic artists, writers and makers. The work on display is varied and visually engaging but not, at first glance, distinct from what one might see at any other gallery or exhibition.It was only as MacKisack steered us to specific pieces and relayed insights into their production processes that more intriguing questions arose.He told us people with aphantasia often report they can’t picture family members when away from them. Or can remember a holiday but are unable to conjure up specific scenes from it.So how might such a person, with little or no internal visual vision, approach producing creative work?Extreme Imagination exhibition at RAMMWe are invited to consider a small, monochromatic oil on canvas by Dutch painter Daan Tweehuysen that beautifully renders a photoreal chunk of shrivelled ginger.Tweehuysen, MacKisack tells us, has developed production strategies that include copying from life or photographic images.There’s nothing unusual about the use of this technique in visual art, except that for Tweehuysen it is his only technique: he is constrained to observation alone.Photographic sources also supply the basis for creative work by illustrator Stephanie Brown who says that, instead of relying on visual imagination, she methodically works through whatever the production of a particular image requires.The Fall of a King was created to accurately illustrate a specific scene from a supplied narrative. Depicting foxes in a graveyard at sunset, she employs insight into the way the brain processes colour to combine warm colours with cool yellow to create the illusion of vibrant green for a grassy foreground.Instead of relying on an image of sunset in her mind’s eye, she uses photographs to work out which colour tones are required.            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            In contrast with this methodical approach, Michael Chance instead relies on improvisation that emerges as he works, using the canvas to develop his ideas instead of his imagination.His painting Bacchus Walk depicts dozens of bodies in different degrees of undress, limbs variously entwined, in a surreal scene in which the different scales at which they appear deny the normal rules of physical reality.He describes his technique as stepping out into the unknown, where the work of painting or drawing becomes a process of visualisation. He bypasses conscious decision-making to allow images to emerge externally, rather than trying to realise inner vision.Susan Baquie also makes work without an outcome in mind. She uses collage to play with materiality before contemplating the results.In The Prahan friend’s brother #4 and The Prahan friend’s brother #5 she responds to news of a suicide, allowing her emotions to guide how she tears and places scraps of paper.She says there were no images of the distressing events in her mind, but that a figurative representation of them seemed to emerge unintentionally in the action of making and from her subliminal awareness of the death of the young man.Extreme Imagination exhibition at RAMMAphantasia also affects other creative endeavours. Writer Ben Hardy concentrates on action and plot in his narratives, rather than detailed visual description, and John Brinnels pieces together his novels using descriptive materials he finds in other writers’ work.MacKisack tells us that despite aphantasia’s apparent challenges, “creativity finds a way”.However, Melissa English Campbell says her hyperphantasic imagination is the basis for her creativity.She can almost photographically visualise, manipulate and refine her work in her mind’s eye, spending hours composing and adjusting a piece before committing it to paper and then production. Honey, an immensely detailed linen weaving, is a typical outcome.This impressive feat would have pleased the Romantics who, MacKisack tells us, extolled the Aristotelian notion that artists give external form to their inner thoughts.Joshua Reynolds, the 18th century Devon-born artist, believed the painter’s purpose was to directly realise their visions. He said: “Whenever a story is related, every man forms a picture in his mind of the action and the expression of the persons employed.“The power of representing this mental picture in canvas is what we call invention in a painter”.Yet the work of the artists in this exhibition defies this conviction: it is inventive, expressive and powerfully representational.Nevertheless, important questions remain. For instance, what is the role of imagination in producing contemporary conceptual work which is often focussed more on ideas than the material, despite typically resulting in the presentation of objects?Tracey Emin says that she climbed out of her famous bed and, in hyperphantasic mode, clearly visualised it sitting in a gallery space. Did Simon Starling float a shed down the Rhine after seeing it in his mind’s eye?My Bed by Tracey Emin at Tate Britain. Photo: Andy Hay.Perhaps such questions are beyond the scope of this exhibition. The work on display offers plenty to contemplate, especially when considered alongside the accounts of its production.Having discovered my own hyperphantasic visual sense, and become more aware of its advantages, I was all the more impressed by the strategies employed by these artists.I found myself wondering whether their aphantasia conveys advantages of its own. MacKisack concurs. “If you have it, you exploit it, and if you don’t, you develop other means”.In any case, it is clear that we need to reconsider the way we imagine imagination itself.Extreme Imagination: Inside the Mind’s Eye is at RAMM in Exeter until 2 June.

"content" : "Most people cannot name one of their MEPs: how many South West voters know they are represented by six? But many in the region are familiar with the Green Party’s Molly Scott Cato, one of the UK’s 73 MEPs, who is standing here for re-election to the European Parliament on Thursday 23 May.The Green Party is often characterised by its commitment to tackling climate change. However, as Molly was quick to point out during a recent campaign visit to Exeter, the party has also long promoted a wide range of progressive social and economic policies, not least on the issue about which some seek to make the European elections a proxy referendum.She said: “We’ve been clear on Brexit right from the start, we’re trying to stop Brexit and we want to remain in the EU. We’re obviously the best party to vote for if you want to see urgent action on climate change. But it’s really important that we also focus on fairness and equality in the economy because we will not end the problem of Brexit, we will not persuade people to stay in the EU, we will not bring our country back together until we address the massive inequalities that have arisen since the financial crisis in 2010.”            The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox                                                                                    Subscribe free                            Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy.            Molly sees part of the EU’s role as dealing with issues that can only be addressed above national level. The EU Green Group, one of (currently) eight major supranational groupings in the European Parliament, collaborates on issues including tax avoidance, toxic pesticides and green economy finance. It has recently succeeded in introducing a new mandatory disclosure regime, the first of its kind in the world, that will require all financial products to reveal their impact on the environment. She said: “When people found horse meat in their lasagne it was a scandal, but we have not had the right to know whether our pension fund was invested in a wind farm or in clearing a rainforest for a palm-oil plantation. Now citizens will have the right to transparency when buying financial products.”More new European legislation will restrict use of antibiotics on farms, where much of the increasing resistance to antibiotics is developing. Molly said: “This is really important to farmers here in the South West: they’re not going to be able to have the same stocking densities, they’ll have to do more outdoor grazing simply to keep their animals healthy because they’re not going to be able to routinely dose them with antibiotics. This is really going to change the way you can farm.”The EU also sets some of the world’s highest standards on climate and environment. It sets the bar on air and water quality, single use plastics and waste management, wildlife habitats and pollution, biodiversity and clean energy. It is the source of most environmental protection in the UK and currently acts as a monitoring body with the power to impose fines for breaches in the law. But the UK government intends to bring forward post-Brexit changes which have been widely criticised for leaving scope to water down these protections.MPs on the UK Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee said key policies would be “severely downgraded” while the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee urged the government to make “significant revisions” to its plans. Molly said: “There’s nothing legally binding there, just aspirations, so if MPs vote for the Brexit deal they vote to come out of this strong framework of protective legislation and vote for an empty box which Michael Gove will fill at a time of his choice. Who would do that? Who would trust Michael Gove to determine our future?.”Molly Scott Cato at Exeter CathedralIn fact, during the May House of Commons opposition day debate on climate change, when Michael Gove claimed a “green thread of ambition” for Conservative governments, he failed to reply when Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asked him how his approach could be reconciled with the government’s decision to back a third runway at Heathrow airport. The government chose not to oppose the motion, so the Labour Party announced that Parliament had declared a climate emergency.But such parliamentary proceedings are not legally binding: the current convention is only for the relevant minister to make a statement to the house within eight weeks. This seems unlikely to lead to decisive action, despite the publication of the government Committee on Climate Change report the day after the debate, which recommended a legally binding target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Molly Scott Cato pointed out that the first UK climate emergency motion was written by a Green Party councillor in Bristol, Carla Denyer, who is also  a candidate for the European Parliament in the South West. It was passed in November 2018, since when more than 70 other councils in the UK have passed similar motions.She said: “All sorts of people are claiming credit now. In most places where this has happened, either from inside the council or outside it, it’s been Green Party people behind it. This is what we’ve wanted to happen for a long time. Last summer’s crazy weather and the IPCC report gave us the opportunity we’ve been waiting for. That’s what the youth strikes have done, that’s what Greta Thunberg has done, that’s what Extinction Rebellion has done. Now it’s easier to push for political change, to argue for much stronger action.”The pressure has been building for some time. Molly was one of the signatories on the Extinction Rebellion launch letter published in October 2018, and she took part in the group’s bridge closure protests in London the following month. In February this year, the Institute for Public Policy Research published a major report that strongly criticised politicians and policymakers for failing to grasp the gravity of the environmental crisis facing the Earth.Later that month Devon County Council passed a climate emergency motion, first proposed in December 2018 by Green Party councillor Jacqui Hodgson. The text of most of the original motion was removed, leaving the climate emergency declaration but deleting the 2030 target date for zero carbon emissions altogether. A spokesperson for the county council nevertheless said its “ambition” was to become carbon neutral by 2050.The school strike climate activists who had gathered at county hall the previous week to demand more rapid action would be forgiven for thinking they were not being taken seriously: the day before the county council released a statement saying they supported the protestors’ aims they made another announcement: that they welcomed £55 million of infrastructure funding, much of which would be spent on roads. Exeter Chamber of Commerce seemed to chime in by simultaneously promoting low-cost flights from Exeter airport.The situation is similar at Exeter City Council, with a twist. When Green Party councillor Chris Musgrave proposed a climate emergency motion in February, the local Labour Party also took a leaf from the Conservative government’s book by removing most of the motion’s text, including all references to a climate emergency, and replacing it with text commending their policies and decisions instead. By the time he had been promoted to city council leader-elect after the May local elections, Phil Bialyk had apparently changed his mind, announcing that one of his “first priorities as new leader will be to get the council to declare a climate emergency”, although the announcement included no new initiatives to tackle the problem.Other Devon district councils are pursuing similar aims, with similarly varying target dates and clarity of purpose. Molly Scott Cato cut through the confusion: “What we have to do is everything we can as fast as we can: we already know what those things are. People have said they’re supporting the climate emergency, now they have to follow through.”Molly Scott Cato at self-build housing in BristolMolly sees confused governance as a major cause not only of our ability to address systemic issues such as climate change, but of widespread disenchantment with politics itself. She said: “Our governance structures are a mess from every point of view. One reason is because there’s no clear responsibility or accountability. So when something goes wrong you don’t know who’s responsible and you don’t know who should sort it out. Different places have different levels of governance. You need a situation where everybody has the same structure, everybody knows who’s responsible for what, so when you’re voting you know what that vote means.”She sees this problem affecting local and regional government as well as supranational decision-making. She said the UK needs “significant devolution of powers down to the regions. We’re more centralised and more under-represented per head than any other country in Europe. When people voted for Brexit one of things they were voting about was a sense of powerlessness. For me, the question they should have been asking is which powers should be exercised at which level.”The subsidiarity principle, that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate level that is consistent with their resolution, has been gaining ground in the UK under the devolved Scottish and Welsh governments, less so in England and Northern Ireland. It was established at EU level by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty that nearly brought down John Major’s government in the Conservative party’s previous internal battle over Europe.Molly sees it as the main issue that lay behind Brexit. “A lot of people were fed up with miserable jobs without any dignity and very poor pay and bad conditions. Those issues can only addressed above national level by constraining the power of corporations, which you can’t do as a national government. These sort of questions should have been at the heart of what was being discussed around Brexit and they just weren’t. People were fed up, wanted to take back control but didn’t think who was taking back control, of what, at what level, because that’s a more complicated question. People don’t vote to leave Devon County Council when the hospitals don’t work well.”She is worried that a lack of citizenship education means people do not understand the electoral system and are prey to disinformation, particularly online. In the South West region in which Molly is standing for election this week, other parties are fielding what could be described as “celebrity” candidates: Ann Widdecombe for the Brexit Party, Andrew Adonis for Labour and Rachel Johnson for Change UK. She is concerned this approach reflects a descent into “the sort of populism we’ve seen in Italy, where a comedian sets up Five Star who can’t make anything work as they’re not experienced politicians. But then people don’t say Five Star were rubbish, I was stupid to vote for them, they say democracy doesn’t work. That’s the danger we’ve got here.”She adds: “Neither the Brexit Party nor Change UK have clear governance structures, they’re not membership organisations. You can be a supporter but you don’t have democratic control over policy. Neither of them have policy platforms but they put an entertaining person out front, provide a floor show and you’re supposed to vote for them.”Molly wonders how many European Parliament candidates even want to be MEPs. “It’s a really important decision we’re making here. If we stop Brexit, which I really hope we will, then we’re talking about people having a lot of power over legislation which will affect everybody for five years. 24 of our 73 MEPs did not get involved in legislation last time, so even if you want them there to stick up for your national interest that is like leaving a third of your power outside. Electing people who aren’t skilled, don’t understand the job, don’t have any experience and are not effective is a problem.”Molly Scott Cato at the European ParliamentRecent polls show pro- and anti-Brexit parties neck and neck at national level, and that three in five UK voters think both UK and EU political systems are broken. Disillusionment is unsurprisingly highest among Brexit supporters, who are expected to be the largest group in all regions except Scotland. The Liberal Democrats are in second place, in front of Labour, and the Greens in third, beating the Conservatives into fourth place. The largest South West regional poll shows the Green Party in third place by vote share, with Labour trailing in fifth position behind the Conservatives.However, when translated onto seats, the d’Hondt party list system of proportional representation that is used in England, Wales and Scotland may mean only a single seat for the Liberal Democrats and Greens in the South West, with the Brexit Party winning four. Those that seek to treat these elections as a proxy referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU will choose between number of votes cast and number of MEPs elected, either for unambiguously leave or remain parties, to support their subsequent arguments. It is unclear how will votes cast for the Labour Party be interpreted.In the May local elections the Green Party got the best results in its 46 year history, more than doubling the number of green councillors across the UK. Molly Scott Cato thinks recent media attention towards climate change is not the only reason why.“There are two things driving our success in the local elections. One is that climate has really risen up the agenda and people trust us to take action, they know that we want to do it and are not just pretending to want to do it. The other one is Labour’s failure to deal with Brexit in any clear way at all. People would probably have more respect for them if they came out and said we’re going to make Brexit happen, but this endless posturing and sitting on the fence at a time of national crisis is really unforgivable.”“I think people in Exeter are feeling really furious about that, then they see the Green Party. They trust us to do what we say, they see we’re strong on climate, they see the clarity of our position on Brexit and they think: well, why would I vote Labour?”Exeter Cathedral is hosting a European election hustings at 7.30pm on Wednesday 22 May at which Molly Scott Cato will be speaking alongside other candidates.

"content" : "Few passing Mount Radford Lawn, near County Hall on Topsham Road, realise that what looks like an ordinary school playing field has been maintained as recreational green space for at least the past 450 years.The occupants of an historic house built during the reign of Elizabeth I first looked out over the lawn c.1570. The house was later rebuilt in the Georgian era, when a cedar-lined carriage drive was added along what is now St Leonard’s Road to lead visitors arriving at the house across the lawn in a graceful curve.In 1826 the house was sold and became a school, before it was demolished in 1902, when its site was redeveloped as Barnardo Road and the lawn was sold to what is now known as the Exeter Royal Academy for Deaf Education (ERADE), which had been headquartered on the other side of Topsham Road since 1828.A century passed until, in June 2018, Exeter City Council granted planning permission for the redevelopment of ERADE’s main site, allowing the charity to enact its plan to relocate to purpose-built facilities on the former Rolle College campus in Exmouth.Acorn Property Group are now set to build 146 new homes, a care home and assisted living units there, as well as accommodation for a pre-school playgroup already housed on the site. ERADE intend to decamp in 2020, after almost 200 years in Exeter.Mount Radford Lawn in the late 19th Century. Copyright © and/or Database Right Landmark Information Group and Ordnance Survey Crown Copyright and/or Database Right 2017.Last month, ERADE revealed its intention to sell Mount Radford Lawn for development as luxury housing by Burrington Estates, who had acquired an option to buy the land subject to successful planning application.Burrington Estates then held a consultation event on 7 May at their offices at Dean Clarke House on Southernhay at which they presented their scheme.Paul Scantlebury, Director of Burrington Estates, said his firm was working in partnership with ERADE to deliver eight new family homes while making part of the site available as a “public open space”.When asked about the many planning hurdles the project appeared to face, he said his firm’s advisors were confident that all relevant issues had been addressed and that the project would proceed.Mr Scantlebury added that ERADE had chosen the scheme among several tenders because of their view that the low density, high quality design and open space allocation would be most likely to gain planning approval.The project plans show around 64% of the site allocated to private housing and 36% to “new parkland with sculptures”. He also said this allocation would generate a combined Section 106 and Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) contribution of around £700,000.Front elevations of proposed development at Mount Radford Lawn. Image Burrington Estates.Exeter City Council’s current published policy is to “consult local communities on how to spend at least 15% of the CIL receipts collected in their area”, which would equate to approximately £100,000 in this case, while also allocating 72% to major infrastructure projects, including St Sidwell’s Point.However, the city has recently conducted an audit of its community grants scheme, which determines how local CIL receipts spending is decided, but has so far refused to reveal its conclusions.It is also not yet clear how the open space proposed in the current plans would be managed, nor who would control access. If the city council were invited to adopt this part of the site as a public park, its acceptance would imply responsibility for maintenance costs.If a management company owned and run by subsequent site residents were to take responsibility for the green space, public access rights might not apply.At the consultation event Mr Scantlebury also said that the size of this open space could be increased during the planning process, with the result that fewer houses would be built, and that ERADE would receive a smaller payment for the site in turn.This would also reduce the CIL contribution, as it is levied according to the amount of new floor space created. As the proposals are for fewer than ten homes, the developers would not be required to provide any affordable housing.Plan of proposed development at Mount Radford Lawn. Image Burrington Estates.St Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association has an entirely different vision for the site. Nigel Fitzhugh, the association’s chair, has put forward a proposal to instead create a community playing field, including sports pitches and running tracks for use by schools and sports clubs, as part of a public park which would also house a community building similar to the newly-built facility at Belmont Park.He said St Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association “has been seeking to build or acquire community premises for 45 years”, pointing at successful community-owned business models funded by grants and donations elsewhere in the country.He cited Exeter City Council’s policies around neighbourhood place-making and promoting active and healthy lifestyles to support wellbeing and reduce social isolation, and also said Mount Radford Lawn had, until recently, been used by local schools for sports activities for many years.Isca School of English confirmed it had “used Mount Radford Lawn for the last 22 years for ten weeks each summer, two evenings a week, for football, volleyball and rounders”.The Maynard School said it had “used the field for lots of summer sporting activities for girls which are important for their health and wellbeing. We do rounders for all ages, juniors athletics, tag rugby, fun football and quick cricket”, and added that it had also used it “for junior sports day and key stage one skills-based activities.”A parent at the school said: “The children used to walk to games, but now have to be bussed to Exeter Arena instead.”St Leonard’s Pre-School, which is also affected by the changes, said: “We were able to use the area for exercise and play with the children, which was particularly enchanting, watching the children running freely in such a safe, open green space and playing hide and seek amongst the beautiful trees.”The playgroup has been forced to relocate temporarily to Palace Gate, pending redevelopment of ERADE’s main site, after which it will return to new buildings there.The pre-school said: “Hopefully we will be situated almost directly opposite Mount Radford Lawn. Many of the children who attend pre-school, although lucky in some ways, live in houses and flats with either very small gardens or no gardens at all.“How wonderful it would be if, by then, Mount Radford Lawn was available for the local community to use and we could take the children to play there again.”Mount Radford Lawn looking towards St Leonard’s schoolThe community has the support of Jemima Moore, the newly-elected independent councillor for Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s, who emerged as a candidate after campaigning to prevent the sale of another of the ward’s green spaces for development at Clifton Hill sports centre.She said: “I would like to see St Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association’s vision, which sees the lawn used as a community-friendly space, championed by Exeter City Council. The lawn is hundreds of years old and is in a conservation area.“It has been used by schools for sports and is an important green space in our city. We need to ensure that Sports England is consulted and that it is given proper protection from being developed.”“At the moment St Leonard’s doesn’t have a community building. Mount Radford Lawn has the potential to become a valuable community space. Residents have let me know that having a place where they can come together for sport, play and to get to know their neighbours is something which would improve their community.”Matt Vizard, a Labour councillor in the ward, also backs the community. He said: “I’m very supportive of the neighbourhood association’s vision for the site. It’s in keeping with what most residents have been saying and are keen to have there. I’m very supportive of residents’ objections to the Burrington proposals.”He added: “The space has been an amenity for the local public for as long as I can remember. Historically there has been resistance to any housing development on that site, and it’s in a conservation area.”Mount Radford Lawn looking towards St Leonard’s church spireMr Fitzhugh identified several challenges for the housing proposals. He said Mount Radford Lawn was neither scheduled for development in the local plan, nor the recently-launched Liveable Exeter housing delivery programme, and that other city council policies related to playing fields and physical activity would support objections to development.He said that Sports England must be consulted over applications to develop playing fields, and has policies which value access to high quality open spaces and opportunities for sport and physical activity.He also said the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) states that playing fields should not be built on unless assessment shows they are surplus to requirements.However, these challenges may turn out to be less robust than first appears, partly because Exeter’s existing local plan is weakened by failing to demonstrate a five-year land supply, partly because Sports England treats school and public playing fields differently (and Mount Radford Lawn is currently neither) and partly because claims that playing fields are not surplus to requirements can be contested.St Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association is nevertheless determined to demonstrate community support for their vision for the site. An online survey that has received an astonishing 300 responses in its first week shows 95.5% support the association’s vision, with only three respondents so far saying they back Burrington Estates’ proposals.And local residents are coming forward saying they would be willing to make significant philanthropic donations to prevent the site being built on.With well-informed arguments centred on NPPF principles concerning effective use of land and appropriate densities, the community’s objections may yet prevail, at least at first hearing.And there are certainly elements of the current development proposals that are insensitive to the local context, no matter how much “the style of the houses will look to complement and enhance the surrounding area”, as the Burrington Estates literature says.Members of the public at the consultation event pointed to the creation of car parking on green space, the positioning of a vehicle entrance opposite school gates which are already very congested at peak times and the erasure of local history implicit in the plan to rename the site as “St Leonard’s Park”.Signs announcing the development that were prematurely erected around the site, covered in graffiti then hastily removed suggest that tensions may develop as the planning process unfolds.Exeter Royal Academy for Deaf Education entrance on Topsham RoadHowever the principal cause of potential conflict at Mount Radford Lawn is prospective profit driven by planning gain, which may yet prevent anyone involved getting what they want.Planning gain is the increase in value of land which results from planning permission being granted for that land. In this case, the site owner, ERADE, would like to get the best possible price for its land. Its trustees rightly say this is their fiduciary duty.The developers, Burrington Estates, would like to build luxury houses with handsome profit margins, which would also allow them to pay the site owner a high price for the land.They are both banking on the city council granting permission for their proposals and, as proponents of this model would say, “unlocking” the value of the site.Their problem is that the city council’s role is to represent the interests of the local community, which would instead prefer to open up and share the land, and a community building it would like to develop, as resources for all.In this case it looks likely that the St Leonards community could raise the funds necessary to achieve its vision, provided the price of the land doesn’t soar as a result of the council approving the developer’s proposals.The situation is made more acute by the fact that the main beneficiary of planning gain would be the site owner, an organisation that is soon to leave the city, and by its statement that it will simply withdraw the land from sale if planning consent cannot be obtained and wait until circumstances are more favourable towards its development.This would leave it enclosed and inaccessible until the maximum possible profit might be realised from its eventual sale. ERADE has form on this: it tried and failed to develop the same site a decade ago, and has been sitting on it since.

Subscribe freeSt Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association has been advised by a local surveyor that Mount Radford Lawn is worth around £150,000 without planning permission, but that it is likely ERADE has been offered more than £1.5 million, possibly as much as £2 million, for the site with planning consent.With this sort of money at stake, it is unlikely these proposals will fall at the first hurdle. The question is how the city council’s planning team will deal with them later, at appeal.Jemima Moore said: “If permission to build houses on Mount Radford Lawn is granted, a historic green space will go from being a resource the community could potentially afford to own and share, through fundraising and donations, to a private asset that is permanently beyond the community’s reach.“It is clear that the best use of the site would be as a community resource, providing sports facilities for schools and clubs, a place for community groups to meet, and a green space managed to maximise biodiversity in the area.”“The Deaf Academy are hoping that the city council will grant planning permission for luxury houses at Mount Radford Lawn, greatly increasing its value to them and their developers.“But the potential for community benefit at Mount Radford Lawn is priceless.”"

While Athens and the forest remain the same, inside are found not only the motley zero-hours crew, but also gender-flipped interpretations of Lysandra, Theseus and Puck.Following last week’s Exeter Pride, themes of gender and sexuality are fresh in the air. This staging seems to create a space in which concepts are free to flow in all directions.Without focusing on a plot line typically associated with explorations of sexuality - the “coming out” narrative - the play simply allows relationships that are not typically represented to flourish.Without drawing much attention to the two lesbian couples on stage, they are embedded into the story rather than separated from the familiar tale.Exeter College students in A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Barnfield Theatre. Photo: James King.I discovered after the play had finished that the company had employed gender-blind casting, allowing the personality of the character to determine the choice of actor, rather than their gender.This gives the production a much more feminist feel than a straight telling, as girls take on a whole new range of roles.From a calm and commanding Theseus, to a wild Lysandra and even wilder Puck, this rendering of A Midsummer Night’s Dream is as much a testimony to the power of women as it is to love, in all its forms.Furthermore, the company explores the character of the Moon, or Artemis, as she guides the young female characters. As Helena struggles to understand her own agency in the world as it all collapses around her, Artemis stands by her in otherworldly grace.The same is true when Hermia and Lysandra struggle to define the boundaries of their relationship: both too are comforted by the Artemis figure.Exeter College students in A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Barnfield Theatre. Photo: James King.Besides subverting the unspoken laws of gender, this performance also tests the bounds of movement. The dance in this performance is incredible. It isn’t just contained in tightly controlled sequences, but fills the stage from one scene to the next.Oberon delivers his lines between acrobatic flourishes as his sidekick Puck leaps and bounds in playful glee. The very stage seems fluid: it is a joy to watch.And, if all this seems heavy - weighed down by concepts of gender and sexuality - remember that A Midsummer Night’s Dream is, after all, a comedy. In which a teenage boy stands on the pink-lit stage of Barnfield Theatre in a dress made of Poundland carrier bags.A Midsummer Night’s Dream by Exeter College UAL students is showing at Barnfield Theatre at 7.30pm Friday 17 and Saturday 18 May, and at 2pm on Sunday 19 May."

It invites visitors to consider what it might mean to have the museum as queer space, to queer the museum itself, by thinking about gender and sexual diversity now, in the past and across the globe.Queering RAMM for Exeter Pride 2019. Remixed image via Wikimedia Commons.The collaboration began when RAMM approached Natalie McGrath to look at how the museum could become a space where LGBTQIA+ people might see their experiences and histories reflected, and how the museum might open up its collections to reveal reimagined stories.Natalie McGrath and Jana Funke then set out to explore the museum through the eyes of young people who identify as LGBTQIA+ from Exeter College and X-Plore Youth Devon, a local charity that runs LGBTQ youth support groups.Jana Funke said: “We had a conversation with them about what would it even mean to have the museum as a queer space. Does it mean we have to have objects that somehow depict queer people? Or that are made by queer artists? What is a queer object?”Insight came from the group: “One of the young people was brilliant: they said we don’t need an object that is grounded in LGBT history, we need stories around the object that show how it may resonate.”Natalie McGrath added: “It became a really playful, open, creative and very queer way to think about how any object can be queer if we frame it in a certain way.”Not just a Georgian dress. Photo: Vanessa Miles.A very open brief emerged. Jana Funke said: “We asked the young people which historical figures do you know? Who are your queer icons? What is missing in history? What do you wish you had learned in school?”Their answers led them to a silk gown. “We were inspired by a television show called Pose, about the drag scene in 80’s New York. In the show there’s a group of queer, trans, gender diverse people who steal all these regal, royal costumes and objects from the museum in New York and do a big drag show.”“We realised if they were to break in to the RAMM this would be one of the objects they might steal. It’s linked to black queer culture, latinx queer culture, which otherwise might not be represented in that particular gallery.“This way we can queer the museum but can also have an intersectional approach, so it’s not just white, British, colonial history but other stories as well. It’s a very playful interpretation.”Natalie McGrath added: “If we think about something like feminism from an intersectional point of view, there isn’t just one feminist story and there isn’t just one story that a museum can tell.“There are so many, multiple stories within the collections themselves. Individual objects themselves present multiple stories.”Butterflies on the Rainbow Trail at RAMM. Photo: Vanessa Miles.The exhibition represents nothing less than a reinvention of the objects themselves, which are finding a new identity by being seen this way.Jana Funke said: “The idea of looking at RAMM as a space that is coming out of a colonial, patriarchal, history then saying let’s come in and queer it and look at it from a different perspective is pretty powerful. And the museum were brilliant at letting us do what we wanted.“They didn’t try to tell us you have to do this, or you have to work in a particular way. It was more like, we want to work with you and see what ideas you have to open up the space.”Natalie McGrath said: “And we learned a lot from the young people. They were really engaged and were very articulate, intelligent and hungry to know more.”Jana Funke added: “I was really impressed. There were things I teach that I have to explain to my first year students at the university but the young people just got it, they knew it anyway. Some of them have even started their own LGBTQ classroom initiatives.”“This is just the beginning. RAMM are really onboard: we see this as the launch of something we can develop, hopefully bringing more voices to the museum. In the autumn we are going to start giving tours, walking round the museum with people and talking about the objects.“And we also want to capture other voices, more young people, but also older people and people of colour who come from different ethnic backgrounds, to find other ways we can queer the museum.”The Rainbow Trail is now open at RAMM. A printed guide is available in the museum reception and on the RAMM website."

"content" : "Voters in Exeter yesterday elected three new councillors to represent them in the key wards that cover the city centre, with all the city’s ruling Exeter Labour group candidates missing out despite the party’s confident campaign.There are ongoing controversies around development decisions taken by Exeter’s Labour-run council in these wards that have angered residents.These include the closure of Clifton Hill sports centre and the planned sale of the green space in which it sits to private developers, the impact of large purpose-built student accommodation blocks on several prominent sites, and the decision to build a new leisure centre and bus station at a cost of £51.8m, more than double the £20m budget originally envisaged for the project.Diana Moore: newly elected Exeter City Councillor for St David’s wardDiana Moore won by a country mile in St David’s for the Green Party, with the largest number of votes of any candidate standing in any ward (1455), the largest margin of victory across the city (659 votes) and the city’s largest vote share (55%).She said: “People are concerned about the fact Exeter is changing a lot and they don’t feel part of that change, and they are very concerned about how well their money is being spent.“If you look at how Labour are taking on huge debts, and how much future income will be tied up in servicing those debts, and then focussing on delivering their big projects at the expense of neighbourhood facilities, shutting public toilets and closing play parks, that’s really worrying.“We need to have facilities in neighbourhoods, particularly as the city grows, particularly in St David’s where the population is getting denser”.She added: “People are also very concerned about environmental issues, about their health because of poor quality air across the city.“Labour said they would introduce a weekly food waste recycling service but they didn’t follow through with action. Exeter is the only district in Devon that sends its food waste for incineration. People still want this service”.Thanking the residents of St David’s for their support, she added: “What people have told me in the ward is that they want me to turn up, they want me to ask difficult questions, and I very much intend to do that. People want to be listened to and included.”Jemima Moore: newly elected Exeter City Councillor for Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s wardJemima Moore, a local resident with no prior political experience, stood as an independent candidate in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s and won handsomely with the second highest number of votes cast for any candidate (1359).This was the first time her team, who recently formed around their campaign to save the Clifton Hill sports centre site, have fought an election.Jemima said she was “absolutely delighted, a little shocked and most of all immensely grateful for the people who supported and voted for me, my amazingly hard-working campaign team and my wonderful husband”.She added: “I hope this indicated the strength of people’s feelings over the sell-off of Clifton Hill and the threats to our green spaces. I hope that the complacency that we have seen from the council will be lessened and we will see them genuinely listening and responding to the people that they represent”.Exeter Labour headquarters is located in the Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s ward, as are the controversial Clifton Hill sports centre site, St Sidwell’s Point development site, and both Bull Meadow Park and Mount Radford Lawn, where green space is also lined up for redevelopment.Michael Mitchell, a Liberal Democrat standing in Duryard &amp;amp; St James, won by a margin of just under 200 votes, beating Conservative veteran Percy Prowse. The Labour candidate finished in third place.Mr Mitchell, who was a councillor in Exmouth for many years, said: “This new experience feels a little like ground hog day. I am looking forward to the challenges ahead. During this campaign I felt real anger on the doorstep about the way the Labour Party in Exeter are running basic services and major projects.”He added: “I look forward to working with others on the council to ensure that there is full and open debate about the key issues impacting upon the lives of the citizens of Exeter.”Exeter city centre council wards.

"content" : "Clifton Hill sports centre, in Exeter’s Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s ward, was closed in March 2018 after heavy snowfall caused a major leak in the roof. Local residents heard rumours that it might not re-open and began campaigning to save the place from closure.Then, when Exeter City Council suddenly decided to demolish the building and sell the whole site, they determined to save the nine acre green space in which it sits too.Despite presenting several popular petitions, demonstrating at the council’s Paris Street offices and firing a fusillade of objections at its Place Scrutiny Committee, local residents and leisure facility users have been unable to make councillors rethink their decision.Along the way, the council has admitted that a public consultation should have taken place, a structural survey was not carried out before their decision and that building maintenance was hindered by the council’s own contract with the sports centre operator.The ballot box is now the focus of frustrated campaigners, who have put forward an independent candidate to contest the ward in the upcoming local elections.Jemima Moore campaigning in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’sJemima Moore thinks Exeter Labour, who currently hold all three seats in the ward, is ignoring local voters: “During the past year, I have met hundreds of people who feel betrayed by the current Labour city council, and its decision to close the Clifton Hill sports centre, sell the green space and effectively close the ski club.“Thousands of Exeter residents signed petitions and attended demonstrations to make their voices heard and were ignored time and time again.”Perhaps more worryingly for the party, she adds: “I would normally vote Labour and that’s what made it most frustrating for me. I feel Labour shouldn’t be selling off publicly owned space to private investors. I feel that it’s not what I voted for. It’s not Labour values.”And she’s not alone: her campaign team reports that many voters in the area bring up the same issues on the doorstep, saying they no longer think the council is acting in their interests.It’s this wider sense of disenchantment with the local Labour party that she says has affirmed her decision to stand as an independent: “While attending council meetings as part of the group trying to save the Clifton Hill green space, I was shocked by the state of city politics. We need greater openness, honesty and integrity among councillors”.Clifton Hill green space campaigners demonstrate at Exeter City Council officesClifton Hill is only one of several green spaces in the area that are being sold to property developers. Campaigners in neighbouring St Leonard’s, now joined with Newtown since Exeter’s ward boundaries were controversially redrawn in 2016, have been vocally opposed to plans to concrete over part of Bull Meadow Park for use by cars.And the private sale of land belonging to Exeter Deaf Academy at Mount Radford Lawn, opposite St Leonard’s primary school, is expected to deprive the ward of another green lung immediately beside busy Topsham Road.Jemima Moore says air quality and vehicle congestion are also major issues for the city. “Exeter desperately needs its green spaces. Outside my house there are illegal levels of air pollution. We have a backdrop of huge declines in biodiversity and climate change. We know that outdoor space is crucial for people’s health and wellbeing.”“The thing that made me most angry was that the Labour councillors originally voted to sell despite many of them not knowing about size of green space behind the Clifton Hill sports centre, or that the proposal included selling off the land used by the golf driving range and ski slope.”Clifton Hill green spaceThe fact that Exeter Place Scrutiny Committee decisions to oppose development at both Clifton Hill and Bull Meadow Park were subsequently overturned by the council’s Executive hasn’t helped the perception among voters that Exeter’s democratic standards have declined.Local campaigners say they are fed up with city councillors saying one thing to them in private then voting another way in public.Since then, Exeter Labour has distributed a campaign leaflet in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s which, under the headline “Clifton Hill site - green space to be saved”, presents a council decision to retain 10% of the sports centre site as green space as “a significant concession for the community”. This resident’s reaction is typical:  Just received comms from @exeterlabour requesting my vote. Following the outrageous handling of Clifton Hill green space situation, they must be joking! I hope the people of Exeter finally tell Labour where to go. Good luck to @JemimaMoore4 and all other candidates of substance.  Sean Callard (@MrCallard) April 18, 2019To add credence to her grassroots credentials, candidates for both Exeter Greens and Exeter Liberal Democrats have decided to stand aside to make way for Jemima Moore’s community campaign, turning this ward election into something of a test of what many see as Exeter’s tribal voting tendencies.Without a Labour incumbent (the party’s candidate, Carol Whitton, is Devon County Councillor for St David’s &amp;amp; Haven Banks) and with the Conservative candidate (Jago Brockway) apparently trying his luck in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s after failing to win in Priory in 2018, it seems Jemima Moore has a firm community base to strengthen her case.Jemima Moore campaigning in Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’sWhile local concerns about the fate of the Clifton Hill site are never far away when campaigning in the ward, Jemima Moore identifies St Sidwell’s Point capital spending as the ultimate driver of the decision to sell a key public asset to private developers.“I do recognise there have been cuts from central government, but at the same time Labour is stubbornly pushing ahead with its new leisure centre and bus station at St Sidwell’s Point. It’s a £51.8 million vanity project that the city can’t afford.“I haven’t come across anyone in Exeter who feels that that’s what they want. Looking after the facilities that we’ve already got would be a greener and more cost effective approach than pulling buildings down and replacing them from scratch.”“Last year, the people of Newtown and St Leonard’s were ignored. That’s what led me to stand as a candidate, to show the Labour councillors that it’s not OK not to listen to the people that they represent.”Next week we shall find out how many of the ward’s voters agree."

"content" : "In early March 2018 Storm Emma met the Beast from the East and dumped a huge amount of snow on the roof of Exeter’s Clifton Hill Sports Centre, located in the city’s Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s ward.This extreme weather event set off a chain reaction which has ignited two campaigns and put Exeter City Council’s approaches to competence and openness into sharp focus.It also led to an independent candidate from the Save our Green Space campaign standing for Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s in the city council elections on 2 May 2019, with the support of both the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats whose candidates decided not to contest the election.This is a summary timeline, with apologies for omissions readers think are important. There are broadly three phases:  from the storm to the council’s decision to demolish the sports centre and sell off the site and the surrounding green space for housing  from the decision to sell to confirmation of the decision after a valuation report  from the confirmation to sell to the present day.Clifton Hill sports centrePhase 1March 2018: Clifton Hill sports centre is progressively closed as the extent of the storm damage becomes apparent.April 2018: Rumours begin to circulate that the sports centre will not re-open. A Save Clifton Hill Sports Centre From Permanent Closure campaign begins as a Facebook group and launches a petition. The group lobbies councillors and, later, makes a plausible but unsuccessful application to Historic England to have the building listed.3 May 2018: Exeter City Council elections. Labour retain their seat for Newtown &amp;amp; St Leonard’s. Their manifesto makes no reference to future plans for Clifton Hill.June 2018: The Save Clifton Hill Green Space campaign begins as a Facebook group. The group initially arrange afternoon and evening walks to draw attention to the value of the green space, then progress to public lobbying of councillors and building community support.12 June 2018: Exeter City Council’s Executive approves hitherto secret proposals to demolish the sports centre and sell the entire site for housing development. The proposals are rushed through for endorsement by a full council meeting the following day. At no point has a council scrutiny committee been asked to comment, which is unusual for a project of this significance, nor has there been any public consultation. The officer report contains factual inaccuracies.Phase 2July 2018 onwards: Both campaign groups keep up a steady flow of information and lobbying points. A critique of the council’s plans is available here.16 October 2018: a petition with 1800 signatures to save the sports centre is handed in to the city council, who then comment that it is too late to be effective.8 November 2018: Phil Bialyk, lead councillor on the issue, acknowledges at Place Scrutiny Committee that there should have been public consultation.November 2018: Exeter City Council admits that no structural survey was carried out on the sports centre before the decision to demolish it.31 January 2019: A packed special meeting of the council’s Place Scrutiny Committee hears objections, in the form of questions from campaigners, to the proposals to sell the green space. The special position of the ski slope emerged at this meeting, and the committee amended the recommendation to the full council so as to exclude the ski slope from the sale of the land.26 February 2019: A petition of 2600 signatures to save the ski slope is presented to a full council meeting, which then decides that the sale should go ahead including the ski slope area on the grounds that without achieving the maximum estimated sale price of £9m there would be insufficient funds to support other commitments already made on leisure facilities. 10% of the land area would be leased back to the council to retain as open space.Phase 3March 2019: Jemima Moore, of the Save Clifton Hill Green Space campaign, decides to stand for election as an independent councillor at the Exeter City Council elections on 2 May."

"content" : "As George W. Bush’s Secretary for Defense Donald Rumsfeld once remarked: “There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say there are things that we now know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know we don’t know.”Getting Rumsfeld’s statement word perfect is challenging, but it nevertheless readily comes to mind when observing and monitoring English local authorities. As long ago as 1960 Parliament passed the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act - sponsored by a newly-elected back bench MP called Margaret Thatcher - which forced local authorities to hold their meetings in public unless specific exemptions from that rule applied. The detailed rules have been updated from time to time, but the principle remains the same.What we get under these rules is of course what councils want us to see. To be fair, officer reports seeking a decision – considered by councillors in public session - often contain a wealth of detail, including nuggets that councillors might prefer were not public. Some reports, and most financial ones, require a degree of knowledge or decoding expertise not possessed by most people. So is this enough to enable we, the people, to scrutinise and hold our councils to account?Let’s look at what is readily available. Council websites are the obvious starting point, though they are usually designed to help people find out what day their bin is emptied rather than reveal background information. Taking Exeter City Council as an example, start with the pages under the “Council and Democracy” heading. This will take you to information about: councillors; agendas, papers and minutes of meetings; plans and policies; financial information including the annual budget and audit reports. Under Council Data, a miscellany of statistics and information on contracts.The minutes and papers are a good starting point for anyone wanting to research a particular topic or find out what the council has been discussing. Or simply for fishing. There is a facility for searching documents, though the results are at times unhelpful. Time and patience are required, but the investment is often worth it.Elsewhere on the website, the most fascinating and useful set of tables is at Council Spending, which lists all individual payments over £250. The spending tables reveal projects few people outside the council have ever heard of, and show trends in spending on, say, consultants and what work they are being used for.Sadly, despite government instructions on openness, councils are making of use of data protection legislation to conceal the identity of commercial suppliers, often on spurious grounds such as “security” and the fact that the private sector doesn’t publish such information. This policy – and it is a policy rather than a legal requirement – is being challenged locally and we will report further on this.Exeter City Council press and public exclusion noticeRedacting information in the spending tables is just one technique councils use to keep information to themselves. Putting sensitive matters in “Part 2” of a meeting agenda enables councillors to exclude the press and public, then present a sanitised summary of the outcome in the published minutes.Holding closed meetings is clearly desirable when staffing and organisation issues are being discussed; it is much less so when decisions on major spending and business plans are being taken.The Information Commissioner upheld a complaint by this author that Exeter City Council were wrong to conceal the original business plan for the leisure centre now being built on the bus station site, though the council appealed to the Information Tribunal and all parties eventually agreed to stay the proceedings, not least because the original plan was overtaken by events.There are other techniques for keeping information away from prying eyes. One of the most effective is to bypass the rules requiring meetings to take place in public by holding the discussion in a “working group” or other informal body. The Greater Exeter Visioning Board, which laid the groundwork for the slowly emerging Greater Exeter Strategic Plan, was not a formal committee of any of the councils involved and so was able to meet in private with impunity.The same is true of the successor arrangements for oversight of developing the plan itself. Exeter City Council has a mysterious Planning Member Working Group described as a “sounding board” of members, which meets in private to discuss planning-related issues.Then there is the simple “no, you can’t see it” tactic. The external review of community grants has been subject to that treatment, and one can only speculate what is in there that the council desperately wants to keep hidden. The same suspicions arise wherever something is withheld for no evident reason.

"content" : "In summer 2016, four district councils authorised work to start on producing a new statutory planning document, the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan (GESP).This aims to set out the overall spatial strategy and levels of housing and employment land required up to 2040 for the East Devon, Exeter, Mid Devon and Teignbridge council areas (excluding Dartmoor National Park). Devon County Council is also a partner, primarily because of its role as the transport, highways, and minerals and waste planning authority.The original timetable, described by planners as “ambitious”, envisaged the plan would pass through all its consultation and examination phases to be in place by the end of 2019. Now, eight months from that deadline, not even the first draft has appeared.During the first quarter of 2017 the GESP team consulted the public on the high-level issues to be addressed in the plan, and on a draft Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) which set out how the plan-makers should engage with communities.A summary of responses received on the issues paper has been published, but there has been no response to comments on the SCI, and now, two years after the public process began, the SCI remains in draft.  Public consultation on a first draft of the plan was initially scheduled for January 2018.The whole idea of GESP was that the participating councils’ local plans would be guided by GESP decisions.  The slipping timetable has caused particular difficulties for Exeter, whose local plan does not demonstrate a five year supply of land for housing – a requirement of the government’s National Planning Policy Framework - and is thus highly vulnerable to challenge by developers who want to build what they like where they like.  Local plans: a quick explanation  All district councils are required to produce a Development Plan to guide future development in the area.  Guidance issued under the Labour government pre-2010 specified the documents to make up these plans, including a Core Strategy and a Development Delivery Plan. Since the introduction of the first National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2012, these requirements have been loosened, but some councils – including Exeter – began their current plans under the pre-NPPF arrangements. This accounts for the use in Exeter planning documentation of terms no longer current, including:      Local Development Scheme: broadly, a list of the documents making up the Development Plan.    Core Strategy: provides a broad strategy for development, a spatial strategy (determines overall land use), strategic policies and strategic allocations (e.g. for housing).    Development Delivery Plan: allocates sites for development, designates sites for protection, and sets out development management policies to assist in determining individual planning applications.    Government policy encourages councils to collaborate in resolving strategic issues across boundaries by working on joint plans – the GESP is an example.  All plans are required to be subject to local consultation in draft form, and then submitted for approval by a government planning inspector.  This process normally takes about three years.  The five year housing land supply requirement is set out in paragraph 73 of the NPPF 2019.  Its purpose is to demonstrate a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to provide five years’ worth of housing against a housing requirement set out in adopted strategic policies, or against a local housing need figure.Indeed, one view of the real purpose of GESP is to dig Exeter City Council out of its hole by moving some of the city’s prescribed housing requirements into other parts of Greater Exeter.This is borne out by a report to the city council’s Executive on 10 July 2018 which stated: “However, there are elements of the Development Delivery Plan which need to follow on from the GESP, in particular the number and broad distribution of new homes and some other forms of development will be a GESP strategic decision.”The same report ensured that Exeter City Council revised their timetable for producing a revised local plan that satisfied national policy requirements, following the GESP delays.Councillors were no doubt influenced by a warning from the council’s monitoring officer who told them: “Exeter City Council’s core strategy which contains its housing allocation targets for the period up to 2026 is vulnerable to challenge and will become increasingly so challengeable until such time as both Exeter Development Delivery Plan and Greater Exeter Strategic Plan have finally been adopted.“Given that care should be given to ensure that no further slippage occurs. There could be reputational damage to the Council in terms of transparency and accountability if the scheme is not updated.”    Essential insight in your inbox    Subscribe for insight about what&#39;s going on in Exeter that you won&#39;t find anywhere else.    Subscribe freeThe reasons for the delay to GESP were cited as:  uncertainty in the light of the government’s reviews of national planning policy and housing policy  a very high response to the call for development sites issued in early 2017  difficulties in resolving transport issues with Devon County Council and Highways England.In September 2018 the GESP team asked the participating councils to approve a high-level vision – not a draft plan - for public consultation. East Devon District Council gave it short shrift on grounds of vagueness and inadequacy. The document has not been heard of since.With a draft plan unlikely to be ready until spring 2019, the risks of running into pre-election purdah meant the publication of the first consultation draft has been rescheduled for June 2019, two years behind the original timetable. This is presumably contingent on no major political changes arising from the council elections on 2 May.The consultation on the draft plan is now scheduled for June 2019, conveniently after May’s round of local elections.The extent to which the absence of a definitive GESP will be used by councils – and particularly Devon County Council as transport authority – for delaying urgently-needed measures to improve air quality through reducing the need to travel, managing down traffic volumes and prioritising cycling, walking and public transport remains to be seen."

"content" : "Today around 70 people joined the Exeter branch of Extinction Rebellion on the city’s streets to demand urgent action to minimise the risk of catastrophic impacts from climate change.They set up stall on the High Street then set off in a colourful procession around the city centre, waving flags, singing and ringing “the alarm bell of the century”. Group members made speeches, handed out flyers and explained their aims to onlookers. Posters promoting their cause decorated bus shelters, statues and street furniture along their route.The event’s organisers called on the government to declare a “climate and ecological emergency”, saying: “We must act now to raise awareness. The health of our planet is in fast decline. We need top down action from our government to help us make the necessary changes. And we need it now.”Extinction Rebellion activists in Exeter Guildhall shopping centreThe procession passed through Cathedral Yard and Princesshay on its way to Guildhall shopping centre. Here the group staged a “die-in” in front of Saturday shoppers and al fresco diners, accompanied by recordings of song by birds at risk of extinction due to climate change.Tony Whitehead of RSPB South West, who assembled the recordings, said the birdsong included curlew, whimbrel, kittiwake, capercaillie, nightingale, snowy owl, golden plover and puffin.A spell seemed to fall as their trills, warbles, chirrups and chatter filled the courtyard, while the trees that once grew where the shopping centre now stands seemed to sway serenely once more as if invoked by their singing.Long minutes slowly passed, public and passers-by looking on, before the group finally stirred and moved back to the High Street for closing speeches.Extinction Rebellion activists in Exeter Guildhall shopping centreToday’s protest comes after the group provoked strong reactions in the city on 13 March, when around 40 people disrupted traffic on key Exeter routes using a technique they called “swarming”.Forming human chains across pedestrian crossings for periods of up to seven minutes at a time, they asked motorists to “tolerate limited delays” during which they handed out leaflets and talked to drivers about their aims.They stopped traffic on Western Way, Topsham Road, Heavitree Road and around County Hall, seeking to highlight Devon County Council’s role in determining city transport policy as Exeter Highways Authority.The Exeter Extinction Rebellion group is one of about 130 across the UK. The international campaign was launched in response to a 2018 IPCC special report that assessed the changes necessary to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, defined as the international aim by the 2015 Paris Agreement."

"content" : "On a chilly March evening, a small audience assembles in Princesshay. All eyes are on a large, open-sided, circular set. Lengths of electrical cable run between tall shards of lighting truss which support spotlights aimed at the circle’s centre.The set resembles a sort of pop-concert panopticon. Red velvet rope loops laid out on the ground inscribe seven smaller circles in a flowing, flower shape. At the centre sit several more spotlights, shining outwards. Ushers encourage passersby and stragglers to come closer: the show is about to begin.Seven performers enter, dressed in identical metallic jackets with bulky VR visors covering their eyes. They take their places, each standing in a red velvet loop. A plaintive piano, string and squeezebox recording starts to play and artificial smoke drifts across the set.Responding to the private world in their headsets, unseen to us, the players begin to move, sometimes in sync with each other, sometimes not. They turn uncertainly on their axes as if dangled by invisible puppeteers, reaching toward objects we cannot see, apparently entranced. They do not roam beyond their rope loop enclosures.As the piece plays on, I become increasingly baffled by the decision to conceal what captivates the dancers. I wonder if they are able to see us, or one another? Part of the pleasure of watching dance can come from seeing expressive and skilful physical movement: no such pleasure is to be found here in the repetitive, disjointed gestures of these performers.This might seem an unfair complaint as the participants in this production are not professional dancers (they are later revealed to be volunteers). However, none of the joy that can arise from simply witnessing spontaneous physical self-expression is available here either.Our Dancing Shadows in Exeter Princesshay during Kaleider MikrofestDescribed as a “social VR experience”, From The Light of The Fire, Our Dancing Shadows was first commissioned by Bristol Watershed’s Pervasive Media Studio for last year’s Layered Realities Weekend, an exploration of the impact of 5G “next generation wireless connectivity” on culture, society and economy.Kaleider claims this production explores “two sides of the same experience, one in VR and the other watching on”, but is communion actually achieved here, or even possible? Kaleider says use of VR technology “enables people to collaborate in the same virtual world at once, untethered”, but there’s little affinity on offer here.Who is collaborating with whom? The sentimental soundtrack suggests a desire to elicit feeling. Yet, essentially isolated from the dancers, we watch people watching VR. What, exactly, is poignant about that?This production alludes to Plato’s cave allegory, apparently seeking to evoke shadows, cast from a fire, flickering on a cave wall: the silhouetted approximation of reality perceived by Plato’s prisoners. Here the world the dancers see is determined by another, in common with Plato’s inmates. They are also confined, in circular prisons (not untethered, as claimed).Writer and director Seth Honnor has said “manipulating audiences to some degree is what all shows and art do”. Plato’s prisoners were trapped in illusion, deprived of access to reality, but the showy theatrical effects employed here seem to celebrate the performers’ captivity and obscure the absence of any insight, potential or realised. Similarly, while Plato’s prisoners escape, discovering their mistaken prior belief in the evidence of their senses, no such release is to be found here.

Subscribe freeThe performance I saw ran without a hitch, for which the technical team (Andy Wood and All Seeing Eye) deserve due props. But their production skill did not compensate for a failure to engender empathy between performers and audience.Watching people watching VR might seem on trend to technology promoters with a DCMS budget to spend, but it needs to be accompanied by more than mawkish music and school disco smoke machines to convey much meaning.I was left wondering whether the source of its funding had compelled the production’s focus on technology regardless of artistic merit. Perhaps my memory of Plato is just a personal projection and these dancing shadows were no more than an element of the performance, dim outlines formed by bodies moving between light and smoke.Either way this production does not reveal whether the 5G future should be revered or reviled.From The Light Of The Fire, Our Dancing Shadows was performed in Exeter’s Princesshay shopping centre on 15 March 2019 as part of Kaleider’s Mikrofest."

Photo: Derek Harper.New student accommodation is being built in the area despite a special planning policy intended to prevent the proportion of full-time residents falling any further. At the same time, the adjacent university campus offers plentiful staff car parking at negligible cost but significant city congestion impact.Building student flats on campus land currently used for car parking and accordingly revising its staff travel strategy would strengthen the university’s credibility as a centre for environmental futures, provide needed additional income and help house the increasing numbers of overseas students it plans to attract in suitably study-integrated accommodation.Meanwhile, many students living in St James possess street parking permits for vehicles whose presence prevents the essential connection of nearby arterial cycle routes with the city centre. Removal of street car parking permit eligibility at properties claiming full council tax exemption would free needed carriageway space for walking and cycling.

Gradually rescinding existing Article 4 area HMO licenses on expiration would create new housing supply of the right kind in the right place to support city centre knowledge economy development.Important mobility changes would be enabled by enhancing Exeter’s cycling infrastructure, economic benefits would accrue to city centre businesses and council tax receipts would increase.At the same time quality of life for the area’s year-round residents would improve as property occupation moved from transient to permanent and familiar problems with noise and waste management were reduced.Exeter St James in spatial context. Image: Exeter St James Forum.Exeter St James is a short walk or bike ride away from the city’s emerging digital economy work hubs, as well as the many retail, leisure and culture providers who would benefit from increased numbers of full-time residents nearby.The neighbourhood should be seen as a strategically important asset which can be leveraged for universal benefit without creating negative impact.This progressive form of regeneration would be driven not by professional property developers but by newly settling residents, permanently embedding their investment in the city.Change would take place incrementally, allowing the word to spread via peer networks and, crucially, would require no public investment.The vision and courage it would instead require from local policy-makers should present a minor challenge compared with the major benefits this form of regeneration would bring."

It is now well-established that building more roads delivers neither congestion relief nor local economic benefits. Instead, reducing road capacity is the most effective way to relieve congestion, recognising the definitive limits imposed on a network by its most restricted, often central, nodes.Temporary road closures can help demonstrate what such counter-intuitive change looks like in practice, easing the way to more permanent transformation.An established approach is to restrict city centre traffic initially only on Sundays, first in selected streets and then more widely, when there is least network pressure and anxiety about adverse economic impacts.Transforming Exeter’s streetscape from the centre outwards would not only enhance the city’s retail and leisure offer and improve public health, it would also transform its ability to attract highly-skilled knowledge economy workers, for whom high quality human-scale urban environments are a strong pull.This approach would also acknowledge that replacing vehicle combustion engines with electric motors solves neither congestion nor pollution problems, whether data-based drivers sit behind the wheel or not.Repurposing road space is not just about restricting vehicle movement. Plentiful car parking spaces encourage visitors and workers to drive into city centres, often obstructing carriageway use for more efficient mobility modes, or preventing more creative use of scarce city centre space.Substantial research shows that the income car parks provide to pay for necessary public services is readily replaced with the economic growth that results from such changes.Exeter city centre space used for car parking. Photo: @ZsoltSchuller.Other routes to changing street use are exemplified by projects such as Playing Out, which helps parents reclaim roads for children’s play, Living Streets, which champions everyday walking, and Pop-up Parks, which playfully reinvents underused urban space. More than 500 UK streets in 45 local authority areas have been closed this way in the past few years, with multiple educational and health benefits.When urban space is reclaimed for non-motorised use, both planned and spontaneous social, economic and cultural activities can take place more freely with all their attendant, often serendipitous, benefits. As Jan Gehl, chief architect of Copenhagen’s mobility transformation says, places designed for people to stay, rather than go, make urban space lively, healthy, sustainable and safe.There is a growing movement for change in the way urban space is used across the world. Janette Sadik-Khan is acclaimed for creating 60 new plazas in just six years in New York as City Transportation Commissioner: 180 acres of road space were reclaimed for cycling and pedestrian use, and a further 44 converted to bus-only. Even parts of Broadway have been closed to motor vehicles, with spectacular success.Many European cities have embraced rapid change in the same spirit, in conjunction with progressive mobility-centred policies that reach far out into the suburbs.In the UK, despite government transport policy still strongly supporting private car use, some of Exeter’s competitors are taking bold steps towards car-free futures. Rather than simply trying to catch up, Exeter should seek to overtake them, taking advantage of its compact footprint to rapidly create a powerful differentiating significator of the city’s sustainability leadership ambitions.The economic development strategy that Exeter shares with its neighbouring district councils already makes much of just such an approach and an ongoing EU-funded local planning project will crucially focus on mobility, rather than transport, which should enable much wider adoption of progressive priorities and innovative strategies to deliver them, given political will.Historic Exe Bridge. Photo: @ExeterCycling.Exeter used to be a nationally notorious traffic bottleneck in the 1950s and 60s, before the M5 was extended, when every vehicle bound further South West still had to cross the river at Exe Bridge (before it was plural).Daily tailbacks stretched several miles along the A30 in one direction and the A38 in the other, with the High Street choked by drivers trying to avoid the by-pass.Sound familiar? Similar congestion often still brings Exeter to a standstill. The city is at risk of reclaiming its status as a congestion nightmare to be avoided at all costs, even without the frequent accidents and congestion that strangle the M5, A30, A38 and other arterials nearby.With 40,000 new residents expected by 2026, adding 14,000 car journeys a day if current travel modes continue, is it not time to reclaim the city’s streets for people instead?"

And millions of people have discovered, or rediscovered, cycling and walking.</p><p>âWhen the country gets back to work, we need them to carry on cycling, and to be joined by millions more. That is why towns and cities in the UK and around the world are making or proposing radical changes to their roads to accommodate active travel.</p><p>âWe recognise this moment for what it is: a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a lasting transformative change in how we make short journeys in our towns and cities.</p><p>âThe government therefore expects local authorities to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians.â</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-quay-cyclists-pedestrians.jpg" alt="Cyclists and pedestrians find social distancing difficult on Exeter quayside"> Cyclists and pedestrians find social distancing difficult on Exeter quayside</p><p>At the same time the government issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities">new statutory guidance</a> to Devon County Council outlining the actions it should take as highways authority <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities/traffic-management-act-2004-network-management-in-response-to-covid-19">to reallocate road space to walking and cycling</a>.</p><p>They include installing mandatory cycle lanes which separate riders from traffic, quickly converting traffic lanes into temporary cycle lanes (suspending parking bays where necessary), and using cones and barriers to widen footways along lengths of road.</p><p>They also include introducing pedestrian and cycle zones by restricting access for motor vehicles to specific streets or networks of streets, particularly town centres and high streets, and closing roads to motor traffic using planters or large barriers to create <a href="https://juststepsideways.com/2018/04/09/waltham-forest-mini-holland-part-3/">modal filters</a>.</p><p>The guidance says âwhole routeâ approaches should be taken to âcreate corridors for buses, cycles and access only on key routes into town and city centresâ.</p><p>The government has directed Devon County Council to implement these measures, among others, âas swiftly as possible, and in any event within weeks, given the urgent need to change travel habits before the restart takes full effectâ.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/parking/traffic-regulation-orders/">Traffic Regulation Orders</a> that would normally make such changes costly for the council have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traffic-orders-advertising-during-coranavirus-covid-19">either been waived or made easier to implement</a>, and it has been directed to make changes âwith a view to making them permanent, and embedding a long-term shift to active travelâ.</p><p>According to legal advice received by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cycling and Walking, <a href="https://www.transport-network.co.uk/Councils-left-to-wait-on-details-of-how-250m-is-allocated/16633">councils are compelled to make the changes</a> and central government could step in to take powers away from councils to ensure interventions are made.</p><p>However Devon County Council has yet to take action in Exeter.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="department-for-transport-new-road-layout-for-social-distancing-sign.png" alt="Department for Transport New Road Layout for Social Distancing coronavirus road sign"> Department for Transport coronavirus road sign</p><p class="uk-dropcap">The Department for Transport <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking">also announced</a> that the Prime Minister would launch an updated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy">Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy</a> in June with further measures to support the governmentâs cycling and walking aims.</p><p>Devon County Council was initially required to create an Exeter <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-cycling-and-walking-infrastructure-plans-technical-guidance-and-tools">Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan</a> under this strategy in April 2017. However three years have since passed without it producing such a plan, despite Exeter Cycling Campaign <a href="(https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s23266/wp211218exh%20Exeter%20Transport%20Steering%20Group.pdf)">highlighting its importance</a> in September 2018.</p><p>Since then the role of such plans in active travel funding <a href="https://www.transportxtra.com/publications/local-transport-today/news/62890/viewpoint-lcwips-starting-to-set-active-travel-agendas/">has become more significant</a>, to the extent that councils that have included them in their transport policy frameworks or have local transport plans with ambitious cycling and walking schemes are more likely to receive funding under the current emergency scheme.</p><p>The Exeter Transport Steering Group, <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s22137/jh181018exh%20Exeter%20Transport%20Steering%20Group.pdf">created at the end of 2017</a> to âadvise on the formulation of transport policy for Exeter and its travel to work areaâ acknowledged in September 2018 that Devon County Council was expected to produce the plans the Department for Transport required no later than summer 2019. Whether the steering group responded to Devon County Councilâs failure to meet the government deadline is not known, as the decisions taken at its most recent meeting in October 2019 have never been published.</p><p>This steering group also oversaw the development of the Exeter Transport Strategy update. It approved the draft at its December 2018 meeting and agreed to take it to <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/haveyoursay/consultations/the-exeter-transport-strategy/">a public consultation</a> in January 2019.</p><p>When the resulting <a href="https://devoncc.sharepoint.com/sites/PublicDocs/Corporate/HaveYourSay/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FPublicDocs%2FCorporate%2FHaveYourSay%2FTransport%2FExeter%20Transport%20Strategy%20Consultation%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FPublicDocs%2FCorporate%2FHaveYourSay%2FTransport">consultation document</a> appeared it received <a href="https://www.devonnewscentre.info/have-your-say-on-future-transport-plans-for-exeter/">widespread criticism</a>. It did not mention <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/06/23/climate-crisis-exeter-devon-carbon-reduction-ultra-low-emission-clean-air-zones-parking-levy-living-streets/">low emission or clean air zones</a>, congestion charging or climate change at all, an omission Exeter Cycling Campaign ânoted with incredulityâ in a <a href="http://exetercyclingcampaign.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Exeter-Cycling-Campaign-response-to-the-Exeter-Transport-Strategy-Jan19.pdf">detailed point by point response</a>.</p><p>It did however say it aimed to âfacilitate the increase of car-based inward commuters from outside the cityâ.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-extinction-rebellion-do-it-yourself-cycle-lane-bike-road-sign.jpg" alt="Exeter Extinction Rebellion Do It Yourself coronavirus cycle lane bike sign"> Exeter Extinction Rebellion DIY coronavirus cycle lane bike sign</p><p>Exeter Cycling Campaign said Devon County Councilâs <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/safe-travel/road-safety/">road safety vision statement</a> âthat every route and every mode should be available to everybody, free from the risk or fear of harmâ was âfar from the reality on our roadsâ. It also pointed out that the strategy lacked âeven a high level timetableâ.</p><p><a href="https://exetergreenparty.org.uk/transport-plan/transport-letter.html">Exeter Green Party said</a> it was âa fundamentally flawed document that we believe is entirely unfit to meet the multiple, challenges that Exeter faces in relation to transport and related issues, including air pollutionâ.</p><p>Exeter City Councilâs consultation response also criticised the draft strategy for its lack of ambition and emphasised the importance of walking, cycling and public transport over private car use.</p><p>It said: âThe city council believes that the time for radical change is upon us, that a step change is needed to encourage people to opt for sustainable travel modes in preference to the car, and that past prevarication about what needs to be done cannot continue.</p><p>âThe city council believes that there is public support for putting pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users first.</p><p>âThe city council strongly supports the need to further reduce the dominance of the car in the city centre and other locations by removing traffic and re-dedicating highway space for public transport, pedestrians and cyclists.</p><p>âWe should be aspiring to the creation of a city where residents, commuters and visitors can access the city through green options that maximise clean air and space for walking, cycling and public transportâ.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-queen-street-pedestrian-in-road.jpg" alt="A pedestrian steps into the road to maintain social distance on Queen Street, Exeter"> A pedestrian steps into the road to maintain social distance on Queen Street</p><p>By the end of the consultation Devon County Council had received around 1100 responses (representing less than 0.1% of the countyâs 1.2 million residents), which it said showed â<a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/traffic-information/transport-planning/innovasump/">widespread support</a>â for the draft strategy. The final version of the document was due for approval at the September 2019 county cabinet meeting, but was delayed without explanation in July to âbetween October and Decemberâ last year.</p><p>In November 2019 it was again delayed, until April 2020, only to disappear altogether from the county cabinet <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryChronology.aspx?IId=19614&amp;Opt=2">forward plan</a> the month before it was due.

The urgency is now, not in next yearâs budget round.</p><p>âBefore the lockdown comes to an end and the schools start back, we need to have really thought about what the new world of travelling to work and school will be.

This means paths that protect those cycling from cars, lower speed limits, and pedestrian- and cycle-only zones. It also includes cutting out rat-runs to create low traffic neighbourhoods, safe school areas and changes to junctions.â</p><p>Mike Walton of Exeter Cycling Campaign said: âDuring the lockdown weâve glimpsed a new future for Exeter. A future where our children can travel safely across the city, where the air is clean and where the car doesnât dominate local neighbourhoods.</p><p>âMany people, many families, want to cycle and will do so if it feels safe. Just imagine how different Exeter would be if most of our short journeys were people-powered.</p><p>âWeâre heartened to hear the government tell local authorities to get things done.

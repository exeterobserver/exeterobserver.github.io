And millions of people have discovered, or rediscovered, cycling and walking.</p><p>âWhen the country gets back to work, we need them to carry on cycling, and to be joined by millions more. That is why towns and cities in the UK and around the world are making or proposing radical changes to their roads to accommodate active travel.</p><p>âWe recognise this moment for what it is: a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a lasting transformative change in how we make short journeys in our towns and cities.</p><p>âThe government therefore expects local authorities to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians.â</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="https://exeterobserver.org/images/coronavirus-social-distancing-walking-cycling-infrastructure-mobility-exeter-quay-cyclists-pedestrians.jpg" alt="Cyclists and pedestrians find social distancing difficult on Exeter quayside"> Cyclists and pedestrians find social distancing difficult on Exeter quayside</p><p>At the same time the government issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities">new statutory guidance</a> to Devon County Council outlining the actions it should take as highways authority <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities/traffic-management-act-2004-network-management-in-response-to-covid-19">to reallocate road space to walking and cycling</a>.</p><p>They include installing mandatory cycle lanes which separate riders from traffic, quickly converting traffic lanes into temporary cycle lanes (suspending parking bays where necessary), and using cones and barriers to widen footways along lengths of road.</p><p>They also include introducing pedestrian and cycle zones by restricting access for motor vehicles to specific streets or networks of streets, particularly town centres and high streets, and closing roads to motor traffic using planters or large barriers to create <a href="https://juststepsideways.com/2018/04/09/waltham-forest-mini-holland-part-3/">modal filters</a>.</p><p>The guidance says âwhole routeâ approaches should be taken to âcreate corridors for buses, cycles and access only on key routes into town and city centresâ.</p><p>The government has directed Devon County Council to implement these measures, among others, âas swiftly as possible, and in any event within weeks, given the urgent need to change travel habits before the restart takes full effectâ.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/parking/traffic-regulation-orders/">Traffic Regulation Orders</a> that would normally make such changes costly for the council have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traffic-orders-advertising-during-coranavirus-covid-19">either been waived or made easier to implement</a>, and it has been directed to make changes âwith a view to making them permanent, and embedding a long-term shift to active travelâ.</p><p>According to legal advice received by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cycling and Walking, <a href="https://www.transport-network.co.uk/Councils-left-to-wait-on-details-of-how-250m-is-allocated/16633">councils are compelled to make the changes</a> and central government could step in to take powers away from councils to ensure interventions are made.</p><p>However Devon County Council has yet to take action in Exeter.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="https://exeterobserver.org/images/coronavirus-social-distancing-walking-cycling-infrastructure-mobility-department-for-transport-new-road-layout-for-social-distancing-sign.png" alt="Department for Transport New Road Layout for Social Distancing coronavirus road sign"> Department for Transport coronavirus road sign</p><p class="uk-dropcap">The Department for Transport <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking">also announced</a> that the Prime Minister would launch an updated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy">Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy</a> in June with further measures to support the governmentâs cycling and walking aims.</p><p>Devon County Council was initially required to create an Exeter <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-cycling-and-walking-infrastructure-plans-technical-guidance-and-tools">Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan</a> under this strategy in April 2017. However three years have since passed without it producing such a plan, despite Exeter Cycling Campaign <a href="(https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s23266/wp211218exh%20Exeter%20Transport%20Steering%20Group.pdf)">highlighting its importance</a> in September 2018.</p><p>Since then the role of such plans in active travel funding <a href="https://www.transportxtra.com/publications/local-transport-today/news/62890/viewpoint-lcwips-starting-to-set-active-travel-agendas/">has become more significant</a>, to the extent that councils that have included them in their transport policy frameworks or have local transport plans with ambitious cycling and walking schemes are more likely to receive funding under the current emergency scheme.</p><p>The Exeter Transport Steering Group, <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s22137/jh181018exh%20Exeter%20Transport%20Steering%20Group.pdf">created at the end of 2017</a> to âadvise on the formulation of transport policy for Exeter and its travel to work areaâ acknowledged in September 2018 that Devon County Council was expected to produce the plans the Department for Transport required no later than summer 2019. Whether the steering group responded to Devon County Councilâs failure to meet the government deadline is not known, as the decisions taken at its most recent meeting in October 2019 have never been published.</p><p>This steering group also oversaw the development of the Exeter Transport Strategy update. It approved the draft at its December 2018 meeting and agreed to take it to <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/haveyoursay/consultations/the-exeter-transport-strategy/">a public consultation</a> in January 2019.</p><p>When the resulting <a href="https://devoncc.sharepoint.com/sites/PublicDocs/Corporate/HaveYourSay/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FPublicDocs%2FCorporate%2FHaveYourSay%2FTransport%2FExeter%20Transport%20Strategy%20Consultation%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FPublicDocs%2FCorporate%2FHaveYourSay%2FTransport">consultation document</a> appeared it received <a href="https://www.devonnewscentre.info/have-your-say-on-future-transport-plans-for-exeter/">widespread criticism</a>.

The final version of the document was due for approval at the September 2019 county cabinet meeting, but was delayed without explanation in July to âbetween October and Decemberâ last year.</p><p>In November 2019 it was again delayed, until April 2020, only to disappear altogether from the county cabinet <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryChronology.aspx?IId=19614&amp;Opt=2">forward plan</a> the month before it was due.

We are also reflecting how this sits alongside the city councilâs emerging Liveable Exeter proposals. This has resulted in a considerable amount of work.â</p><p>However all these factors predate the consultationâs conclusion, and none explain why the decision to postpone the strategy was taken five months later in July.</p><p>Rydon Lane retail park was completed in 1995, the same year Amazon and eBay launched, and Stagecoach has run the majority of Exeterâs bus services since 1996.</p><p>Exeter City Council and Devon County Council have both had statutory responsibilities to improve Exeterâs air quality <a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8804/CBP-8804.pdf">since 2007</a> and Devon County Council published its Local Transport Plan in 2011, since when there have been three changes of government.</p><p>Marsh Barton railway station was planned in 2013 and has been due since 2016.

The urgency is now, not in next yearâs budget round.</p><p>âBefore the lockdown comes to an end and the schools start back, we need to have really thought about what the new world of travelling to work and school will be. Now is the time to be looking at this in detail and, in effect, ripping-up the highways budget approved in February and starting again.â</p><p>At the same time Exeter Cycling Campaign published a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1El53uujBvGMIkHNzkqS0wkYcX7zO86-x/view">crowd-sourced analysis</a> of Exeter pinch points which make social distancing difficult with suggestions for making them safe under the new government guidelines.</p><p>It recommends interventions on key arterial routes including Heavitree Road, Alphington Road and Cowick Street as well as the Barrack Road/Polsloe Road/Mount Pleasant Road route to the Royal Devon &amp; Exeter hospital at Wonford and Queen Street near Exeter College.</p><p>It also recommends the removal of motor traffic on Fore Street and Topsham High Street, the expedition of the existing E4 scheme on Union Road and modal filtering in residential areas including St James, St Leonards and Heavitree.</p><p>The campaign group said: âThe idea is to help people feel safe enough to choose active travel. This means paths that protect those cycling from cars, lower speed limits, and pedestrian- and cycle-only zones. It also includes cutting out rat-runs to create low traffic neighbourhoods, safe school areas and changes to junctions.â</p><p>Mike Walton of Exeter Cycling Campaign said: âDuring the lockdown weâve glimpsed a new future for Exeter. A future where our children can travel safely across the city, where the air is clean and where the car doesnât dominate local neighbourhoods.</p><p>âMany people, many families, want to cycle and will do so if it feels safe. Just imagine how different Exeter would be if most of our short journeys were people-powered.</p><p>âWeâre heartened to hear the government tell local authorities to get things done. It provides the mandate to Devon County Council to urgently lock in safe, convenient and connected routes for people to walk and cycle.â</p><p>Stuart Hughes, county council member for highway management, was asked at last weekâs meeting to specify where the county would <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/b12158/Publication%20of%20Public%20Question%20and%20Answer%2013th-May-2020%2010.30%20Cabinet.pdf?T=9">make the changes directed by the transport secretary</a>.</p><p>He replied that the focus would be âon city and town centres where narrow footways could restrict pedestrian movement and on our urban walking and cycling networks where funding may enable us to fill gapsâ.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.devonnewscentre.info/devon-exploring-temporary-measures-for-walkers-and-cyclists/">a statement</a> the county then confirmed that temporary measures were âbeing exploredâ to extend and improve the existing walking and cycling network.</p><p>However the changes outlined in Exeter include only minor interventions in the city centre and in some residential streets and fall far short of the ânew eraâ of âlasting transformative changeâ involving âsignificant changes to road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestriansâ envisaged by the government.</p><p>And by indicating that it will consider only existing schemes, and in the absence of a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan or Exeter Transport Strategy which prioritises walking and cycling over private cars in the city, Devon County Council has effectively ruled out following government guidelines to make significant changes in Exeter city centre or on its key arterial routes.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="https://exeterobserver.org/images/coronavirus-social-distancing-walking-cycling-infrastructure-mobility-milan-pop-up-cycle-lanes.jpg" alt="Pop-up cycle lanes in Milan"> Pop-up cycle lanes in Milan.

The City of London is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9fbfcf58-c710-40b0-91ee-0811686fa391">banning cars on all the arterial routes in the square mile</a>.

He said: âWe have no choice but to rapidly repurpose Londonâs streets for people. By ensuring our cityâs recovery is green we will also tackle our toxic air, which is vital to make sure we donât replace one public health crisis with anotherâ.</p><p>Hackney Borough Council decided to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/world-cities-turn-their-streets-over-to-walkers-and-cyclists">filter its streets</a> using bollards and planters on 20 April, three weeks before the Transport Secretaryâs announcement, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/09/uk-councils-to-enforce-temporary-road-closures-for-safer-school-runs">other councils are closing roads near schools</a> to deter people from driving to drop off and pick up their children.</p><p>Manchester has closed the Deansgate area of its city centre to traffic altogether and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/21/bristol-reveals-plan-to-pedestrianise-historic-centre-in-covid-19-reforms">Bristol is following suit</a>, with plans to restrict major city centre routes, close Bristol Bridge to private vehicles and pedestrianise much of its Old City area. Birmingham, Sheffield and Leicester have all fast-tracked similar plans.</p><p>Cities across Europe are also making dramatic changes to their roads as lockdown eases. Berlin has created <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/cleaner-and-greener-covid-19-prompts-worlds-cities-to-free-public-space-of-cars">fourteen miles of new bike lanes</a> in three days. Milan has created 22 miles of new lanes and Brussels 25 miles, with the entire city centre now designated as âslow streetsâ where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/slow-streets-can-coronavirus-cure-brussels-of-addiction-driving">pedestrians and cyclists have priority over car drivers</a>.</p><p>Athens has allocated 50,000m2 of public space to cyclists and pedestrians and Paris, which has already created twenty miles of new cycling infrastructure, has plans for another 30 miles. Mayor Anne Hidalgo said: âIt is out of the question for the city to return to the pre-coronavirus traffic jams and vehicle pollutionâ.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="https://exeterobserver.org/images/coronavirus-social-distancing-walking-cycling-infrastructure-mobility-paris-pop-up-cycle-lanes.jpg" alt="Pop-up cycle lanes in Paris"> Pop-up cycle lanes in Paris.

She said: âCreating more space for walkers and cyclists in Exeter is vital to keep people safe from infection and help prevent a return to the congestion and air pollution that plagued our city before the COVID-19 crisis and subsequent lockdown.</p><p>âPublic transport will be unable to cope safely with high passenger numbers, so increasing active travel, especially for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-survey-statistics">40% of urban journeys that are less than two miles</a>, will be the only way to prevent gridlock in Exeter.</p><p>âWe need a joined-up approach to enable people to cycle safely into and around the city centre and to places of work. This will mean <a href="https://exeter.greenparty.org.uk/news/2020/05/15/greens-urge-councils-to-reallocate-road-space-to-ensure-cyclists-and-pedestrians-are-covid-safe/">reallocating space on sections of major routes</a>.â</p><p>Meanwhile Exeter Extinction Rebellion has stepped in to create DIY pop-up bike lanes in the city centre in response to council inaction. The group said it wanted to highlight the need to make the streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Members then demonstrated the need for full-width lanes to maintain social distancing when riding bikes.</p><p>Caspar Hughes of <a href="http://stopkillingcyclists.org/">Stop Killing Cyclists</a> said: âWhile other councils are rapidly changing their streets to make them safe when lockdown eases, Devon County Council is doing nothing.</p><p>âLocal authorities all over the country are making use of the governmentâs relaxation of Traffic Regulation Orders to install wider pavements and protected space for walking and cyclingâ.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="https://exeterobserver.org/images/coronavirus-social-distancing-walking-cycling-infrastructure-mobility-exeter-high-street-cyclists.jpg" alt="Cyclists demonstrate socially distanced cycling on Exeter High Street"> Cyclists demonstrate socially distanced cycling on Exeter High Street</p><p>As the clean air and calm that made walking and cycling in Exeter a pleasure for the first time in decades give way to rapidly rising levels of returning traffic, polls show that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-end-poll-environment-food-health-fitness-social-community-a9469736.html">only 9% of us</a> want to return to life as it was before the pandemic and that <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/a414r61690/Greenpeace_Travel_200507_w.pdf">71% are concerned</a> about air pollution returning to pre-lockdown levels.</p><p>With studies showing that air pollution levels are linked with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/is-air-pollution-making-the-coronavirus-pandemic-even-more-deadly">COVID-19 symptom severity</a> as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/air-pollution-linked-to-far-higher-covid-19-death-rates-study-finds">death rates</a>, and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/clean-air-in-europe-during-lockdown-leads-to-11000-fewer-deaths">1750 fewer deaths</a> occurred in the UK during lockdown due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/23/toxic-air-over-london-falls-by-50-at-busiest-traffic-spots">dramatically improved air quality</a>, campaigners are calling for widespread implementation of the governmentâs intended <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/09/uk-to-invest-cycle-lanes-coronavirus-air-pollution">transport system changes</a>.</p><p>In an open letter to local authority leaders and ministers, nine organisations including Greenpeace, Transport Action Network, Cycling UK and Living Streets said: âIt would be completely absurd if, after the unprecedented efforts and sacrifices made to save thousands of lives from COVID-19, we allowed thousands more to be cut short by the devastating impacts of toxic pollutionâ.</p><p>However the much higher levels of active travel seen during lockdown that have led to a <a href="https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/">50% drop in air pollution</a> in Exeter city centre will continue only if local authorities make the significant changes that give more space to cyclists and pedestrians that the government expects.</p><p>And the 61% who feel <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/walking-and-cycling-statistics-cw">cycling on the road is too dangerous</a> seem to have a point in Exeter, where <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/safe-travel/road-safety/collision-data/data-dashboards/">39% of 255 road accident casualities in 2018</a> involved pedestrians or cyclists.</p><p>80 year-old grandmother Margaret Turner said: âAs a seasoned cyclist I also ride on the roads but always, until the lockdown, felt I was taking my life in my hands.</p><p>âItâs noticeable how few people normally cycle in Exeter.

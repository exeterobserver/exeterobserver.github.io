And millions of people have discovered, or rediscovered, cycling and walking.</p><p>“When the country gets back to work, we need them to carry on cycling, and to be joined by millions more. That is why towns and cities in the UK and around the world are making or proposing radical changes to their roads to accommodate active travel.</p><p>“We recognise this moment for what it is: a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a lasting transformative change in how we make short journeys in our towns and cities.</p><p>“The government therefore expects local authorities to make significant changes to their road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-quay-cyclists-pedestrians.jpg" alt="Cyclists and pedestrians find social distancing difficult on Exeter quayside" width="800" height="450"> Cyclists and pedestrians find social distancing difficult on Exeter quayside</p><p>At the same time the government issued <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities">new statutory guidance</a> to Devon County Council outlining the actions it should take as highways authority <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reallocating-road-space-in-response-to-covid-19-statutory-guidance-for-local-authorities/traffic-management-act-2004-network-management-in-response-to-covid-19">to reallocate road space to walking and cycling</a>.</p><p>They include installing mandatory cycle lanes which separate riders from traffic, quickly converting traffic lanes into temporary cycle lanes (suspending parking bays where necessary), and using cones and barriers to widen footways along lengths of road.</p><p>They also include introducing pedestrian and cycle zones by restricting access for motor vehicles to specific streets or networks of streets, particularly town centres and high streets, and closing roads to motor traffic using planters or large barriers to create <a href="https://juststepsideways.com/2018/04/09/waltham-forest-mini-holland-part-3/">modal filters</a>.</p><p>The guidance says “whole route” approaches should be taken to “create corridors for buses, cycles and access only on key routes into town and city centres”.</p><p>The government has directed Devon County Council to implement these measures, among others, “as swiftly as possible, and in any event within weeks, given the urgent need to change travel habits before the restart takes full effect”.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/parking/traffic-regulation-orders/">Traffic Regulation Orders</a> that would normally make such changes costly for the council have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/traffic-orders-advertising-during-coranavirus-covid-19">either been waived or made easier to implement</a>, and it has been directed to make changes “with a view to making them permanent, and embedding a long-term shift to active travel”.</p><p>According to legal advice received by the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cycling and Walking, <a href="https://www.transport-network.co.uk/Councils-left-to-wait-on-details-of-how-250m-is-allocated/16633">councils are compelled to make the changes</a> and central government could step in to take powers away from councils to ensure interventions are made.</p><p>However Devon County Council has yet to take action in Exeter.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="department-for-transport-new-road-layout-for-social-distancing-sign.png" alt="Department for Transport New Road Layout for Social Distancing coronavirus road sign" width="800" height="450"> Department for Transport coronavirus road sign</p><p class="uk-dropcap">The Department for Transport <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking">also announced</a> that the Prime Minister would launch an updated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-investment-strategy">Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy</a> in June with further measures to support the government’s cycling and walking aims.</p><p>Devon County Council was initially required to create an Exeter <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-cycling-and-walking-infrastructure-plans-technical-guidance-and-tools">Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan</a> under this strategy in April 2017. However three years have since passed without it producing such a plan, despite Exeter Cycling Campaign <a href="(https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s23266/wp211218exh%20Exeter%20Transport%20Steering%20Group.pdf)">highlighting its importance</a> in September 2018.</p><p>Since then the role of such plans in active travel funding <a href="https://www.transportxtra.com/publications/local-transport-today/news/62890/viewpoint-lcwips-starting-to-set-active-travel-agendas/">has become more significant</a>, to the extent that councils that have included them in their transport policy frameworks or have local transport plans with ambitious cycling and walking schemes are more likely to receive funding under the current emergency scheme.</p><p>The Exeter Transport Steering Group, <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s22137/jh181018exh%20Exeter%20Transport%20Steering%20Group.pdf">created at the end of 2017</a> to “advise on the formulation of transport policy for Exeter and its travel to work area” acknowledged in September 2018 that Devon County Council was expected to produce the plans the Department for Transport required no later than summer 2019. Whether the steering group responded to Devon County Council’s failure to meet the government deadline is not known, as the decisions taken at its most recent meeting in October 2019 have never been published.</p><p>This steering group also oversaw the development of the Exeter Transport Strategy update. It approved the draft at its December 2018 meeting and agreed to take it to <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/haveyoursay/consultations/the-exeter-transport-strategy/">a public consultation</a> in January 2019.</p><p>When the resulting <a href="https://devoncc.sharepoint.com/sites/PublicDocs/Corporate/HaveYourSay/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FPublicDocs%2FCorporate%2FHaveYourSay%2FTransport%2FExeter%20Transport%20Strategy%20Consultation%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FPublicDocs%2FCorporate%2FHaveYourSay%2FTransport">consultation document</a> appeared it received <a href="https://www.devonnewscentre.info/have-your-say-on-future-transport-plans-for-exeter/">widespread criticism</a>. It did not mention <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/06/23/climate-crisis-exeter-devon-carbon-reduction-ultra-low-emission-clean-air-zones-parking-levy-living-streets/">low emission or clean air zones</a>, congestion charging or climate change at all, an omission Exeter Cycling Campaign “noted with incredulity” in a <a href="http://exetercyclingcampaign.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Exeter-Cycling-Campaign-response-to-the-Exeter-Transport-Strategy-Jan19.pdf">detailed point by point response</a>.</p><p>It did however say it aimed to “facilitate the increase of car-based inward commuters from outside the city”.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-extinction-rebellion-do-it-yourself-cycle-lane-bike-road-sign.jpg" alt="Extinction Rebellion Exeter Do It Yourself coronavirus cycle lane bike sign" width="800" height="450"> Extinction Rebellion Exeter DIY coronavirus cycle lane bike sign</p><p>Exeter Cycling Campaign said Devon County Council’s <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/safe-travel/road-safety/">road safety vision statement</a> “that every route and every mode should be available to everybody, free from the risk or fear of harm” was “far from the reality on our roads”. It also pointed out that the strategy lacked “even a high level timetable”.</p><p><a href="https://exetergreenparty.org.uk/transport-plan/transport-letter.html">Exeter Green Party said</a> it was “a fundamentally flawed document that we believe is entirely unfit to meet the multiple, challenges that Exeter faces in relation to transport and related issues, including air pollution”.</p><p>Exeter City Council’s consultation response also criticised the draft strategy for its lack of ambition and emphasised the importance of walking, cycling and public transport over private car use.</p><p>It said: “The city council believes that the time for radical change is upon us, that a step change is needed to encourage people to opt for sustainable travel modes in preference to the car, and that past prevarication about what needs to be done cannot continue.</p><p>“The city council believes that there is public support for putting pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users first.</p><p>“The city council strongly supports the need to further reduce the dominance of the car in the city centre and other locations by removing traffic and re-dedicating highway space for public transport, pedestrians and cyclists.</p><p>“We should be aspiring to the creation of a city where residents, commuters and visitors can access the city through green options that maximise clean air and space for walking, cycling and public transport”.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-queen-street-pedestrian-in-road.jpg" alt="A pedestrian steps into the road to maintain social distance on Queen Street, Exeter" width="800" height="450"> A pedestrian steps into the road to maintain social distance on Queen Street</p><p>By the end of the consultation Devon County Council had received around 1100 responses (representing less than 0.1% of the county’s 1.2 million residents), which it said showed “<a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/traffic-information/transport-planning/innovasump/">widespread support</a>” for the draft strategy. The final version of the document was due for approval at the September 2019 county cabinet meeting, but was delayed without explanation in July to “between October and December” last year.</p><p>In November 2019 it was again delayed, until April 2020, only to disappear altogether from the county cabinet <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryChronology.aspx?IId=19614&amp;Opt=2">forward plan</a> the month before it was due.

We are also reflecting how this sits alongside the city council’s emerging Liveable Exeter proposals.

The urgency is now, not in next year’s budget round.</p><p>“Before the lockdown comes to an end and the schools start back, we need to have really thought about what the new world of travelling to work and school will be.

This means paths that protect those cycling from cars, lower speed limits, and pedestrian- and cycle-only zones. It also includes cutting out rat-runs to create low traffic neighbourhoods, safe school areas and changes to junctions.”</p><p>Mike Walton of Exeter Cycling Campaign said: “During the lockdown we’ve glimpsed a new future for Exeter. A future where our children can travel safely across the city, where the air is clean and where the car doesn’t dominate local neighbourhoods.</p><p>“Many people, many families, want to cycle and will do so if it feels safe. Just imagine how different Exeter would be if most of our short journeys were people-powered.</p><p>“We’re heartened to hear the government tell local authorities to get things done. It provides the mandate to Devon County Council to urgently lock in safe, convenient and connected routes for people to walk and cycle.”</p><p>Stuart Hughes, county council member for highway management, was asked at last week’s meeting to specify where the county would <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/b12158/Publication%20of%20Public%20Question%20and%20Answer%2013th-May-2020%2010.30%20Cabinet.pdf?T=9">make the changes directed by the transport secretary</a>.</p><p>He replied that the focus would be “on city and town centres where narrow footways could restrict pedestrian movement and on our urban walking and cycling networks where funding may enable us to fill gaps”.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.devonnewscentre.info/devon-exploring-temporary-measures-for-walkers-and-cyclists/">a statement</a> the county then confirmed that temporary measures were “being explored” to extend and improve the existing walking and cycling network.</p><p>However the changes outlined in Exeter include only minor interventions in the city centre and in some residential streets and fall far short of the “new era” of “lasting transformative change” involving “significant changes to road layouts to give more space to cyclists and pedestrians” envisaged by the government.</p><p>And by indicating that it will consider only existing schemes, and in the absence of a Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan or Exeter Transport Strategy which prioritises walking and cycling over private cars in the city, Devon County Council has effectively ruled out following government guidelines to make significant changes in Exeter city centre or on its key arterial routes.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="milan-pop-up-cycle-lanes.jpg" alt="Pop-up cycle lanes in Milan" width="800" height="450"> Pop-up cycle lanes in Milan.

By ensuring our city’s recovery is green we will also tackle our toxic air, which is vital to make sure we don’t replace one public health crisis with another”.</p><p>Hackney Borough Council decided to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/world-cities-turn-their-streets-over-to-walkers-and-cyclists">filter its streets</a> using bollards and planters on 20 April, three weeks before the Transport Secretary’s announcement, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/09/uk-councils-to-enforce-temporary-road-closures-for-safer-school-runs">other councils are closing roads near schools</a> to deter people from driving to drop off and pick up their children.</p><p>Manchester has closed the Deansgate area of its city centre to traffic altogether and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/21/bristol-reveals-plan-to-pedestrianise-historic-centre-in-covid-19-reforms">Bristol is following suit</a>, with plans to restrict major city centre routes, close Bristol Bridge to private vehicles and pedestrianise much of its Old City area.

Berlin has created <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/cleaner-and-greener-covid-19-prompts-worlds-cities-to-free-public-space-of-cars">fourteen miles of new bike lanes</a> in three days. Milan has created 22 miles of new lanes and Brussels 25 miles, with the entire city centre now designated as “slow streets” where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/slow-streets-can-coronavirus-cure-brussels-of-addiction-driving">pedestrians and cyclists have priority over car drivers</a>.</p><p>Athens has allocated 50,000m2 of public space to cyclists and pedestrians and Paris, which has already created twenty miles of new cycling infrastructure, has plans for another 30 miles.

She said: “Creating more space for walkers and cyclists in Exeter is vital to keep people safe from infection and help prevent a return to the congestion and air pollution that plagued our city before the COVID-19 crisis and subsequent lockdown.</p><p>“Public transport will be unable to cope safely with high passenger numbers, so increasing active travel, especially for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-travel-survey-statistics">40% of urban journeys that are less than two miles</a>, will be the only way to prevent gridlock in Exeter.</p><p>“We need a joined-up approach to enable people to cycle safely into and around the city centre and to places of work.

Neither do Exeter’s youth climate activists: none of us can tackle this crisis alone.</p><p>But it is also clear that, despite expressing support for carbon neutrality when first confronted by Exeter’s youth climate strikers in February 2019, and declaring their intent to make the city carbon neutral by 2030 the following month, city councillors had very limited understanding of what reducing Exeter’s carbon footprint to sustainable levels would actually involve.</p><p>The Exeter City Futures “Net Zero” Exeter plan subsequently commissioned by the council acknowledges that it also has limitations, and that it is incomplete work in progress that requires further input and development before an update at the end of the year.</p><p>However it actually has profound flaws that cannot be addressed by minor changes.</p><p>These include ignoring major sources of emissions altogether, an unexamined reliance on unworkable and unjust carbon offsetting, and a mismatch between what is expected of the private sector and what the private sector is capable of delivering.</p><p>The consultation on the plan’s content was little more than performative, and it leaves monitoring mechanisms unexplained, relies heavily on voluntary behaviour change and ignores unavoidable systemic transformation in favour of partial, technocratic <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/solutionism">solutionism</a>.</p><p>Since the plan was published, its failure to explore approaches to change that do not rely on massive inward capital investment has become even more acute as <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/04/24/exeter-city-council-announces-1.584-million-april-budget-shortfall-caused-by-covid-19-restrictions/">financial shortfalls</a> caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted Exeter City Council’s chief executive to describe plan delivery as “<a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/06/05/exeter-city-futures-net-zero-exeter-2030-plan-exeter-city-council-executive-decision/">problematic</a>”.</p><p>The city council’s Executive has nevertheless already accepted it and Exeter’s full council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=6253">meets today</a> to confirm that decision.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-youth-climate-strike-we-want-change.jpg" alt="Exeter youth climate strikers holding placard reading &quot;We want change&quot;"> Exeter youth climate strikers.

But we remain extremely concerned about how such proposals will be implemented, and by whom.</p><p>We offer these criticisms to challenge Exeter to confront the transformation that is necessary for a just transition to a low carbon economy. Analysing and challenging political decisions in the public sphere is necessary for any democracy to function. We should always be open to criticism, and support, from each other.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-global-climate-strike-bedford-street-crowd.jpg" alt="Exeter global strike for climate fills Bedford Place in September 2019"> Exeter youth climate strikers</p><p class="uk-dropcap">First, some definitions. <strong>Greenhouse gases</strong>, including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, are emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, the clearance of land and the production and consumption of food, goods, materials, buildings, roads and other products and services.</p><p>The <strong><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4155/cmt.10.39">carbon footprint</a></strong> of a defined population, system or activity is its total greenhouse gas emissions considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage, expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). When products and services are imported, the emissions from their supply chains are imported with them.</p><p><strong>Carbon offsetting</strong> involves compensating for emissions in one place by reducing them in another, often where it is cheaper to do so.</p><p>The idea is that industries in developed countries which employ the most efficient technologies, but nevertheless still emit greenhouse gases, invest to make projects in developing countries cleaner than they would otherwise be. (In practice this is often not what happens, as we shall explore in the next article in the series.)</p><p>Carbon offsetting comes in two main forms: voluntary, where it is often bought by consumers to alleviate guilt or businesses to promote their brands, or via compliance mechanisms imposed on companies or countries by governments or transnational organisations like the European Union.</p><p>As even basic human needs such as food, warmth and shelter are difficult to achieve without carbon emissions in industrialised societies in which many people have very high expectations about living standards, cities such as Exeter cannot avoid offsetting if they want to stop contributing to the climate crisis.</p><p>A <strong><a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/news-and-events/insights/net-zero-an-ambition-in-need-of-a-definition">net zero</a></strong> carbon population, system or activity entails that population, system or activity removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere itself in order to counteract its carbon emissions, which is very difficult to achieve for Exeter because of its limited land supply and the sources of its emissions.</p><p>In contrast <strong><a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20190926STO62270/what-is-carbon-neutrality-and-how-can-it-be-achieved-by-2050">carbon neutrality</a></strong> typically involves the purchase of offsets to counteract emissions instead of drawing down carbon directly.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img data-src="carbon-footprint-food-supply-chain.png" alt="Carbon footprint of global food supply chain" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> <a href="carbon-footprint-food-supply-chain.png" data-alt="Carbon footprint of global food supply chain" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Carbon footprint of global food supply chain.

At the same time, as the plan notes, the government’s proposed <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/housing-secretary-unveils-green-housing-revolution">Future Homes Standard</a> may in any case prohibit this approach.</p><p>In fact the only way to avoid enormous offsetting costs from 2030 onwards, while upholding its carbon reduction commitments, is for the city to reduce its carbon footprint much more comprehensively than the current “Net Zero” Exeter plan proposes.</p><p>But without understanding the true scale of its impact, domestically and internationally, the city cannot begin to grasp the scale of the change that is necessary to reduce its offsetting liabilities to the point it can afford to meet its carbon reduction goals.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3233038" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3233038/embed"><script defer="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Sources: <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/exeter-city-futures/">Exeter City Futures</a>, <a href="https://devoncc.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/PublicDocs/Environment/Ea5ikvSgI0xLmsZf-g4qR2gB_Cugs-H4K2fqy7-ODP6CfA?e=yf7PHW">University of Exeter</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint">DEFRA</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-carbon-trading/">WEF</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/downloads/reports-and-publications/policy/planning/west-of-england-carbon-reduction-requirement-study-carbon-offsetting-april-2019.pdf">Centre for Sustainable Energy</a></p><p class="uk-dropcap">Exeter City Futures did initially propose to assemble an academic team with the requisite specialist expertise to establish a “robust definition of what is included in the measurement of Exeter’s carbon emissions” as well as “how this accounts for the carbon emissions created in the wider region by commuters”.</p><p>This was to be accompanied by a measurement framework, which would have greatly helped to clarify what is undoubtedly a complex situation and thus enable much more effective policy-making.</p><p>Exeter City Futures later acknowledged, in its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=750&amp;MId=6472">December 2019 progress report</a>, that it did not have the “resource capacity” to deliver the baseline audit or “highlight gaps between current plans and what is required to achieve a carbon neutral city”.</p><p>But the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=750&amp;MId=6472">scrutiny committee which heard the progress report</a> (the same meeting that did not comment on the replacement of “carbon neutral” with “net zero”) did not comment on this failure either.</p><p>And, according to the council, it did not need to take up the suggestion as the University of Exeter study of 2017 emissions supplied both <a href="https://devoncc.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/PublicDocs/Environment/Ea5ikvSgI0xLmsZf-g4qR2gB_Cugs-H4K2fqy7-ODP6CfA">data</a> and <a href="https://devoncc.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/PublicDocs/Environment/EYqUbF71YPFFmDzkjWaCX5oBO_adpSPMspXsZP4BjUxTlg">methodology</a>.</p><p>However, as we have seen, this study did not include imported emissions from aviation, shipping or supply chains.

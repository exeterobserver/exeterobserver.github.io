This new initiative goes much further in its scope, its membership and its agenda.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-college-hele-road-car-park-construction-site.jpg" alt="Exeter College Hele Road campus construction site"> Exeter College Hele Road campus construction site</p><p>What is now known as the Liveable Exeter Place Board started life in July 2019 when the council’s executive <a href="http://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=5809&amp;Ver=4">agreed a recommendation</a> from its chief executive, Karime Hassan, to establish a Liveable Exeter Garden City Board.</p><p>The purpose of the new board was described as “the vehicle through which Exeter will ensure that the desired transformational housing agenda known as Liveable Exeter Garden City is achieved” and “to support Exeter in its mission to be recognised as a leading sustainable city and global leader in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of climate change and urbanisation”.</p><p>The garden city programme vision had been approved by the executive and the <a href="http://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=6260&amp;Ver=4">full council</a> in February 2019.</p><p>Mr Hassan’s recommendation continued: “The overarching aim of the board is to provide its constituent local authorities (Exeter and Devon County Council) and partners with a forum in which to address collaboratively issues relating to housing delivery, place shaping, economic development, clean growth, and carbon neutral development at a city and sub-regional level and <em>to enable collective decision-making</em> on issues that require agreement from the constituent authorities and other key public sector stakeholders” (our emphasis).</p><p>Mr Hassan nevertheless stressed that nothing in the proposal was to be read as incorporating any executive functions properly exercised by councils.</p><p>The recommendations were adopted by Exeter City Council in <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=5802">July 2019</a>. The chief executive was authorised to settle the terms of reference and to identify suitable members for the board, then report back to the executive when this was done.</p><p>No such report was ever received. The leader of the city council, Phil Bialyk, justified this at the <a href="http://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6201&amp;Ver=4">June Executive committee meeting</a> in response to a question from Councillor Diana Moore by saying: “The original draft terms of reference agreed by Council have not been amended in any meaningful way.

We subsequently established that a significant number of city councillors did not know who was on the board, a point only recently rectified at a private briefing for elected members.</p><p>The chair is Sir Steve Smith, the about-to-retire vice chancellor of Exeter University.

A <a href="http://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49600">report</a> to the city council’s executive meeting in June about plans for the city’s recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 virus explained the board’s role in the following terms:</p><p>“The Liveable Exeter Place Board brings together all the major organisations in the city as well as private and voluntary sector figures. It allows for frank and candid confrontation of the issues they face in a manner that supports collaboration through a common purpose. The issues involved with a recovery plan for the city are broader than the city council and will benefit from being adopted by the place board.”</p><p>The recovery plan is split into seven work streams which were already active at the time of the report to councillors. Six are chaired by place board members:</p><ul><li>Business support - Matthew Roach (Managing Director, Exeter Airport)</li><li>City centre - John Laramy (Principal, Exeter College)</li><li>Visitor economy - Charles Courtenay (Earl of Devon)</li><li>Transport - Mike Watson (Managing Director, Stagecoach South West)</li><li>Construction and development - Sir Steve Smith (Vice-Chancellor, University of Exeter)</li><li>Community wellbeing - Dinah Cox (Chair, Devon Community Foundation)</li></ul><p>Each work stream has a lead council officer and is overseen by a member of the council’s <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/contact-us/senior-management-officers/senior-management-team/">senior management board</a> which itself meets in private. The report did not identify a chair for the education work stream</p><p>At its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6201">June meeting</a> the council’s executive agreed that the board should “adopt” the city’s coronavirus recovery plan and at the same time that it should also adopt the “Net Zero” Exeter plan intended to make the city carbon neutral by 2030. Bizarrely, this second <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/06/05/exeter-city-futures-net-zero-exeter-2030-plan-exeter-city-council-executive-decision/">decision was recorded</a> as the place board adopting the “Liveable Exeter Place plan”.</p><p>At its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6202">July meeting</a> the council’s executive then agreed to add oversight of the <a href="https://www.sportengland.org/campaigns-and-our-work/local-delivery">Sport England local delivery pilot</a> to the board’s portfolio. This gives the Liveable Exeter Place Board responsibility over four major city council policies and programmes (including the original garden city project).</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-city-football-club-st-james-park-stagecoach-adam-stansfield-stand.jpg" alt="Exeter City Football Club St James Park Stagecoach Adam Stansfield Stand"> Exeter City Football Club St James Park Stagecoach Adam Stansfield Stand</p><p class="uk-dropcap">Exeter Observer’s initial enquiries revealed that the place board did have specific terms of reference but the city council’s spokesperson said only that: “its principal focus is to support the council in achieving and promoting its vision for the city”.</p><p>In response to a question about openness the spokesperson said: “Minutes of the board are not published owing to the commercial and sensitive nature of some discussions – but any matters requiring council decisions or scrutiny would be progressed through the normal decision-making pathways and minutes produced accordingly”.</p><p>Exeter Observer subsequently wrote to all non-council board members on the list provided by the council. We asked each member two questions: what they saw the board’s role as being in practice, and how they would describe their personal contribution to the board’s work.</p><p>Only two replied, saying in effect that they could not comment until the board had discussed the issues we raised. A senior council officer then made contact to say that the board would collectively discuss our questions at its next meeting on 8 July.</p><p>We responded by requesting that our concerns about the confidentiality of board proceedings would be addressed. This request was made in the context of a remark by Councillor Ollie Pearson, the council’s executive member for leisure and physical activity, at a <a href="http://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=750&amp;MId=6571&amp;Ver=4">Strategic Scrutiny committee meeting on 2 July</a> when he referred to the place board as providing “the best and most transparent oversight” of the Sport England pilot.</p><p>The place board met on 8 July, after which the city council issued the following statement in the name of its chief executive and growth director, Karime Hassan:</p><p>“We are hugely grateful to the board for giving up their valuable time. They have adopted a vision of Exeter that is based on the premise of better life for all.</p><p>“It is a vision that a district council couldn’t achieve on its own. There are all manner of challenges that the city needs to overcome.</p><p>“Exeter is stronger for having conscientious, talented people from all backgrounds who want to work in the best interests of the city.</p><p>“It shouldn’t be confused with a district council. Any decisions requiring council permission or funding are part of a transparent and democratic process that is the envy of the world.”</p><p>Had the date been right, the final sentence might reasonably have been viewed as an April Fool’s joke: the city council <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/10/09/exeter-city-council-reduces-scrutiny-decision-making/">cut scrutiny of its own decision-making</a> in October last year.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-central-station-independent-shops-small-businesses.jpg" alt="Independent small businesses beside Exeter Central Station"> Independent small businesses beside Exeter Central Station</p><p class="uk-dropcap">The city council’s acknowledgement that it cannot meet the challenges facing Exeter on its own is welcome and realistic. The council has set itself a huge and far-reaching agenda which, if implemented, would lead to major changes in the shape of the city and the way people interact with it.</p><p>Setting up a group of advisers in response to such challenges is an approach with ample precedent in central government, where transparent expert advisory committees are (or at least were) a standard feature of policy-making.</p><p>In practice, however, the Liveable Exeter Place Board has not got off to a good start against some of the claims made for it.</p><p>The council claims that the board’s membership is “diverse” but the facts do not bear this out. For example, in terms of gender, it is male-dominated: only four of its 24 members are women. In terms of representation, its business members are from the construction, tourism, transport and sport sectors, with the rest from the usual pool of public sector bodies with a dash of high culture thrown in.</p><p>There is no seat round the table for the retail, food or hospitality sectors, nor for the small, independent businesses that are integral to the city’s economy. No one on the board appears able to claim recent experience of the hardship, disadvantage and poverty experienced by many Exeter residents. No one speaks for community groups (the Devon Community Foundation is a grant-giving body).</p><p>Nor does council coyness about the board’s role and activities inspire trust. Roles sketched out for the original board in July 2019 included (our emphasis):</p><ul><li><em>Develop and set joint investment strategies</em> for the city and sub-region</li><li><em>Develop an infrastructure plan</em> in support of the Liveable Exeter Garden City and as and when required the Greater Exeter Strategic Plan and associated sub-regional transport strategy</li><li><em>Consider and prioritise</em> bids for external funding, <em>including leading</em> on housing, industrial and other appropriate deals</li><li><em>Consider, approve and implement decisions</em> relating to Exeter and as appropriate subregional investment, including expenditure of external funding within the sub-region.</li></ul><p>We do not know whether these functions found their way into the place board’s terms of reference, as the council has not provided that level of detail. If they did, then these are important matters in which there is significant public interest. Not all these actions will necessarily come to the city or county councils for formal decisions to be made and so will not be exposed to “a transparent and democratic process that is the envy of the world”.</p><p>The composition of the board also raises questions about level playing fields and competitiveness.

The “transformational housing delivery programme”, which is focused on “priority sites in public ownership”, aims to deliver 308 new homes on the sites of the Harlequins and Guildhall shopping centres.</p><p>Curlew Alternatives, a developer which has previously specialised in purpose built student accommodation, <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KFMnVqkV23rDhfoNAkOt9vZqlOnt7v/2/482582/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">said the redevelopment of the Harlequins site</a>, which is owned by Exeter City Council, offers a “once in a generation opportunity to turn a failed shopping centre into a vibrant mixed-use development that brings inward investment into the city”.</p><p>The redevelopment scheme presented to Exeter City Council in 2017 by the shopping centre’s former owners proposed student accommodation across the whole site, but pre-planning discussions and public consultation which began in June last year eventually produced <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/permissions-and-applications/related-documents/?appref=19/1556/FUL">revised proposals</a> for a five storey 116-bed hotel and a seven storey block containing 251 “co-living” bedspaces, of which 99 are in studios and 152 in “cluster flats”.</p><p>Co-living development is an emerging global real estate investment vehicle which is virtually indistinguishable from purpose built student accommodation. Building designs typically do not meet minimum space or amenity standards and tenancies are typically short-term and at rents double those charged in traditional private sector rented accommodation.</p><aside class="insert"><form id="insertsubscribeform" class="form" action="" method="POST"><p>The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox</p><input class="snarefortheunwary" type="text" name="snarefortheunwary" value="" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"><div class="uk-grid-small" uk-grid=""><div class="uk-width-expand@s"><input class="uk-input" type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" required=""></div><div class="uk-width-auto@s"><button class="uk-button uk-width-1-1" id="subscribeformbutton" type="submit" value="submit">Subscribe free</button></div></div><p>Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>-compliant <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><div id="insertsubscribeformmessages"></div></form></aside><p>Opposition to the scheme has been widespread, with local and national conservation charities and hundreds of residents objecting on a wide range of grounds including harm to Exeter’s historic environment as well as the substandard design of the co-living block and the likelihood that, despite the developer’s claims, it will largely, if not entirely, be occupied by students. The redevelopment also poses significant risks to the section of Exeter city wall beside the site.</p><p>More than 4000 people signed a petition opposing the development. One local resident called the design “a hideous, vile, ugly, totally monstrous, grossly oversized collection of blocks”, while another said the development was “an inappropriate hijack of a significant city centre location”. The Victorian Society said it would cause “significant harm” which had not been justified as required in the National Planning Policy Framework and could not be offset by the claimed public benefits of the proposal.</p><p>According to the developer these include benefits to Exeter’s economy derived from the construction and subsequent operation of the hotel and co-living block, including spending associated with visitors and residents. However these were significantly overstated in the report to the planning committee which decided the application.</p><p>The developer also claimed the co-living block would help the council meet its housing supply targets, but the government’s housing delivery test excludes such accommodation from its calculations.</p><p>The council allowed the developer to fall short on its affordable housing provision requirements despite the city’s housing affordability crisis, and accepted the developer’s claims about minor public realm improvements at face value. Having said it would define its policy position on co-living before the redevelopment plans were submitted, as other cities have done, it instead decided to postpone the issue.</p><p>Exeter City Council’s planning committee, which is dominated by ruling Labour group Executive members, subsequently approved the plans, subject to a legal agreement which has yet to be completed and other conditions being met. Exeter City Council leader <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=885">Phil Bialyk</a> said: “I really do think that this is a move in the right direction”.</p><p>However it has since emerged that the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government, who overturned approval for a similar co-living block in the centre of Norwich earlier this month, may intervene to call in and potentially overrule the city council’s decision.</p><p>In this special report we examine the key issues involved in the decision and the basis on which it was made, and raise the prospect of more development decisions being taken this way by Exeter City Council under its “Liveable Exeter” banner.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="hotel-student-accommodation-elevations.png" alt="Harlequins co-living and hotel block elevations" width="1920" height="1000"> <a href="hotel-student-accommodation-elevations.png" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Harlequins co-living and hotel block elevations.

Many of the <a href="https://www.architecture.com/image-library/features/british-social-housing-1920s-1980s.html">progressive social housing reforms of the interwar years</a> were focussed on addressing the issue.</p><p>A <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KEc4ZJiAc0pp8TqfnIrn1QT6P/2/482689/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">briefing note</a> submitted as part of the Harlequins application by JLL, the developer’s agent, nevertheless described what it called “micro-living” as “a growing trend”. It also claimed that “micro-living” includes “the more traditional model of micro housing […] known generally as Houses of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs)” despite these being <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00708/SN00708.pdf">first defined in 2004 UK legislation</a> which introduced licensing intended to tackle overcrowding, poor property management and impose minimum standards on a sector which often houses vulnerable tenants.</p><p>There were an estimated 497,000 HMOs in England and Wales at the end of March 2018. Official estimates of the number of co-living units are not available, but only a few such developments have so far gained planning permission in the UK.</p><p>JLL said the micro-living “trend” is the result of “growing affordability issues” and described co-living as an HMO “hybrid” in which units provide “all of a person’s basic housing needs” but which are “smaller in size”. Underlining the financial factors that drive the frequently tiny bedspaces provided in co-living developments, James Kingdom, an associate director at the firm, said: “Where land values are higher or pressures on land use are greatest, then there is an obvious need to increase the number of people that can live in these locations.”</p><p>He also said that communal areas, such as dining or living rooms “provide the trade-off for a smaller living space” and, surprisingly, that these “are features that are unlikely to be present in a house share or self-contained flat.”</p><p>Other differences with ordinary rented accommodation are that bedspaces are fully-furnished and optionally serviced at extra cost. Philip Hillman of JLL said: “The student accommodation sector has been transformed by a new generation of students who have grown accustomed to higher levels of serviced accommodation than has previously been available.</p><p>“After graduation, they are pursuing similar high-quality accommodation that provides them with flexibility and consistency, regardless of location. Co-living seeks to fill a gap in the traditional residential market by providing a bespoke no strings attached purpose built managed offering.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="old-oak-london-coliving.jpg" alt="Old Oak co-living development in London" width="800" height="672"> <em>Old Oak</em> co-living development in London.

JLL cites a <a href="https://www.thecollective.com/locations/old-oak">550-bed nine storey development</a> near Willesden Junction in London as an example. <em>Old Oak</em> which, like the proposed Harlequins block, was also originally intended to be student accommodation, offers a gym, spa, restaurant and bar and includes twice-weekly room cleaning and bed linen changes in the rent.</p><p>It was the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-43090849">UK’s first large scale co-living development</a>, opening in 2016. Its marketing materials invite you to join a “thriving community” in which you can “find friendly faces, stimulating shared spaces and a boundary pushing events programme, all right inside your home”.</p><p>It was developed by a company called <a href="https://www.thecollective.com/">The Collective</a> which has since also opened a “haven of community and creativity” in a 21-storey 705-bed block at Canary Wharf and a 125-bed hotel in New York which is “packed with unique communal spaces designed to connect, learn and unwind”. The company has three developments in the pipeline, also in New York, which will add <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/realestate/co-living-grows-up.html">another 1215 units</a> to its portfolio. <a href="https://www.thecollective.com/about-us">It says</a> its “mission is to build and activate spaces that foster human connection and enable people to lead more fulfilling lives”.</p><p>However in a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90573240/how-co-living-could-replace-the-human-connection-that-weve-lost-in-the-pandemic">market forecast to be worth $550 billion</a> over the next ten years in the US and Europe alone, <a href="https://westburyproperty.net/our-services/build-to-rent-management.html">co-living’s potential</a> “to produce a greater return on investment” than standard private rented sector development may be what is really motivating <a href="https://colivfund.com/2019/10/14/coliv_launch/">massive investment in the sector</a>.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="older-womens-cohousing-london.jpg" alt="Older Women's Cohousing development in London" width="800" height="585"> <em>Older Women’s Cohousing</em> development in London.

Matthew Stewart of the University of Westminster <a href="https://failedarchitecture.com/the-collective-is-not-a-new-way-of-living-its-an-old-one-commodified/">says</a> that the most alarming feature of developments such as <em>Old Oak</em> “isn’t the banality of its architecture, the vague claims of solving a housing shortage or the pessimistic idea of a narcissistic youth driven through the next networking opportunity”, it’s that “this ‘new way of living’ is in fact a commodified old way of living, one that is steeped in the language of modernism yet robbed of its radical social intent”.</p><p>Maria Brenton is a founder member of <a href="https://www.owch.org.uk/">Older Women’s Co-Housing</a>, a group of women over fifty who share an <a href="https://cohousing.org.uk/blog/older-womens-cohousing-community-wins-housing-design-award/">award-winning</a> purpose-built development of 25 flats in London which the group created in partnership with a housing association. She says developer-led co-living projects that use the same language of community and inclusion as the <a href="https://cohousing.org.uk/">co-housing movement</a> are misleading because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/03/co-living-the-end-of-urban-loneliness-or-cynical-corporate-dormitories">their residents don’t have any say in how the place is run</a>.</p><p><a href="https://citymonitor.ai/uncategorized/forget-community-london-s-co-living-spaces-are-about-living-selfishly-4520">Other critics say</a> co-living developments are <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/43xgx9/this-new-co-living-space-is-the-dystopian-symptom-of-a-london-failing-young-people">symptomatic of cities failing young people</a>, in which “the radical promise of co-housing has been co-opted” to promote “a private sector fix that merely scrapes the surface of a problem that the market first created”.

It then became a mixture of hotel and student accommodation in pre-planning discussions.</p><p>Then, in the months leading up to the formal submission of plans, Exeter City Council leader Phil Bialyk began promoting the idea that the development could be used as student accommodation and co-living combined.</p><p>In August 2019 <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/leaders-column-collaboration-and-co-living-will-create-sustainable-future/">he said</a> he had discussed the city’s “policy on purpose built student accommodation” with councillors, officers and developers, and had received “commitments from some for co-living, which means that purpose built accommodation would be open to anybody and everybody”.</p><p>In September 2019 <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/leader-column-how-we-will-create-balanced-and-sustainable-communities/">he said</a>: “We want new purpose-built student accommodation to have space for anyone to rent. This is the way we will achieve balanced and sustainable communities. Co-living will help future-proof expansion in this [higher education] sector, and I have been very encouraged with discussions I have had with developers and the university about our future planning policy in this area.”</p><p>Then in October 2019 <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/new-purpose-built-student-accommodation-should-be-available-to-all/">he said</a>: “Co-living will allow key workers and anyone else to live alongside students” <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/leader-column-developing-quality-housing-in-the-city/">and</a> “We’ve had some good discussions with developers about co-living.

The developer was keen to ensure that there was no misunderstanding: a <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/exeter-shopping-centre-plans-amended-3502860">Devon Live report about the plans</a> was “amended after Curlew explained its co-living scheme does not refer to students and key workers and young professionals co-living side by side”.</p><p>Students will nevertheless be free to live there, and are expected to live there: occupation is open to everyone over eighteen years of age. Devon &amp; Cornwall Police expressed concern about safeguarding and “the potential for disruption” with student and non-students living alongside each other in <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KLUC3RSM7wOIGDgBump1vkx/2/485055/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">its response to the planning application</a>, and councillors repeatedly referred to students living in the block at the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=116&amp;MId=6648">October planning committee meeting</a> which approved the application.</p><p><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5825">Diana Moore</a>, Green Party councillor for St David’s ward, which includes the Harlequins site, described the co-living plans as “warehousing for people”, adding that they “appear to follow the same floor plans as the pre-application consultation showing student housing”. Keith Lewis of Exeter Civic Society also said: “The co-living accommodation appears to be exactly the same as that presented at consultation earlier in 2019 for student accommodation”.</p><p>Liberal Democrat councillor <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5827">Michael Mitchell</a>, who is a member of the council’s planning committee, said that the proposed twelve week co-living leases “mirror university terms” and that the block “appears to be, in all but name, more student accommodation”.</p><p>JLL director Chris Dadds <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=116&amp;MId=6648">nevertheless said</a>: “the accommodation is for co-living, so it’s not a student scheme”. When pressed on how he would distinguish the plans for the Harlequins co-living block from those that would have been submitted had it instead been intended as student accommodation, he said it “wouldn’t have the same level of shared amenity on the lower floors or on each floor. The cluster flats would have looked similar but they wouldn’t then have shared wider accommodation within the building.”</p><p>Comments made by another JLL director, Richard Lustigman, in a <a href="https://residential.jll.co.uk/insights/opinions/co-living-co-living-coliving">briefing note earlier this year</a> may have been more revealing: “When it comes to defining coliving […] the term does surprisingly little to help us distinguish what it actually is. But could that ambiguity be its greatest strength? The sheer inability to be packaged and compartmentalised into an easily digestible definition is one of coliving’s greatest strengths.”</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="community-stakeholders">Community stakeholders?</h3><p>The <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KvxqE2Mn0yOqR9yAbOZuOjZ/2/498635/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">management plan for the proposed Harlequins co-living block</a> says the “co-living product” delivers its claimed benefits through, among other things, “building managers and owners who have a stake in the local community”.</p><p>The scheme’s <a href="https://thisisfreshrenting.com/">management company</a> is part of <a href="https://freshpg.com/">Fresh Property Group</a>, which is based in London and has more than 17,000 accommodation units under management on 66 sites across the UK &amp; Ireland.

It said “this approach fails to properly engage with the nature of the asset’s significance and their relationships with each other, or the surrounding topographic landscape”, adding “the use of matrices tends to confuse the concepts of significance, sensitivity and magnitude of impact whilst atomising complex relationships between features and apparent impacts.</p><p>“Consequently we have concerns about its use in cases with multiple assets with complex relationships, such as in the case of this application.” Historic England also said: “Due to the number of assets affected the cumulative impact needs to be considered, which will be greater than the independent elements”.</p><p>However Exeter City Council’s heritage officer ignored these recommendations in <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KrvxHtLTr0Exi0grtcF7UAyaf4qk/2/512174/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">his report</a>, instead relying on the heritage impact assessment approach adopted by the developer.

However it overlooked the city’s public administration sector despite local economic activity running at almost double the national rate in this area, and ignored the fact that Exeter’s health, education and public administration sectors are almost entirely dependent on public spending.</p><p>Exeter has one of the <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/data-tool/su/4d237577">lowest levels of private sector jobs in the country</a>, and one of the <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/data-tool/su/4a457f1d">lowest ratios of private to public sector employment</a>. It is seventh from bottom in the Centre for Cities index on both metrics. Instead of recognising that Exeter’s economy is largely dependent on public sector activity, the economic impact assessment based its conclusions on the assertion that Exeter is “mainly dominated by businesses in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy">tertiary sector</a>, which benefits from consumer and local business spending” of the sort likely to be associated with the proposed Harlequins redevelopment.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="centre-for-cities-ratio-private-to-public-sector-employment-2018.png" alt="Ratio of private to public sector employment 2018 - Centre for Cities bar chart" width="800" height="795"> Ratio of private to public sector employment 2018.

This produced a spending estimate of £366.63 per person per week, or just over £19,000 per annum. The 251 proposed co-living block residents were thus estimated to be worth just under £4.8 million each year.</p><p>However the figure for average single person household expenditure, with regional weighting, allows just £305 per month for housing costs, which is less than a third of the expected starting rate of £1000 per month for cluster flat bedspaces and less still compared with the £1100 per month the Harlequins studios are expected to cost. The economic impact assessment made no attempt to estimate cluster flat bedspace or studio charges, instead simply describing the development as “affordable”.</p><p>Nowhere in any of the published proposals are these critically important figures provided, and nothing was said about prospective rent levels in the co-living block at the planning committee meeting which decided the application. At such rates, around two thirds of the £19,000 each co-living resident is expected to spend each year would be swallowed by rent. This is double the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/752217/household-rent-to-income-ratio-by-region-uk/">average proportion in the South West</a>.</p><p>In addition, letting agents typically require that prospective tenants earn an annual gross salary equal to at least 30 months of rental charges, so eligibility for a cluster flat bedspace at £1000 per month requires a salary of £30,000 a year, and a studio at £1100 per month a salary of £33,000. But <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/data-tool/su/044f24a2">average annual earnings in Exeter</a> are just under £25,800, well below the national average of £28,700 which is still not enough to afford a co-living cluster flat bedspace at these rates.</p><p>And full-time <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">minimum wage workers</a> between eighteen and twenty years of age earn just over £12,500 each year, rising to £17,000 by the time they are 25.

Removing a realistic estimate of housing costs from the £19,000 each co-living block resident is expected to spend each year means a dramatic fall in the residual sum spent locally, leaving just £111.78 per person per week, or a total just over £1,450,000 each year for the whole block, 30% of the sum claimed by the developer.</p><p>Following the economic impact assessment methodology, this has the consequence of reducing the co-living block’s operational expenditure-driven job creation value to just over seven net jobs, and its net additional annual Gross Value Added to the Exeter economy to just over £220,000, less than half the amount claimed.</p><p>The operational viability and economic value of the proposed hotel was also calculated by relying on averages. These were sourced from a fourteen year-old study of the Exeter hotel market and four year-old national survey-based estimates of tourism activity. The <a href="http://www.englishrivierabid.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Appendix-1-2017-FAQ.pdf">tourism activity report</a> says: “The methodology and accuracy of these sources varies, and therefore the estimates can only be regarded as indicative. Because of the data sources and modelling process, there will be a potentially large margin of error associated with individual figures, with small numbers being particularly prone to such errors.”</p><p>The six tourism surveys used each relied on multiplying small survey samples to produce national figures which were then combined before being subdivided again into regional then subregional figures. This methodology has not been independently validated since 1994.</p><p>The <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KUWqAhSJw33x7ejV4Dl49xdZ2Gb/2/482699/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">economic impact assessment</a> then took each of these figures and further subdivided them, compounding the factor by which a small error would be magnified. It ignored the decade-long gap between the two sources, then took two further averages and multiplied them all together to produce the headline figure which was reproduced in the planning officer’s report: a total annual visitor expenditure figure of £3.5 million</p><p>However variations of just 15% in each of the estimates combine to reduce this to £1,844,000, only just over half the amount claimed. And this is without allowing for the 25% of visitor expenditure which the assessment states will not be spent in Exeter or the 50% that would be displaced from other hotels in the city, which together further reduce the figure to £461,000.</p><p>In addition, were the hotel were to fail, or no operator be found, as none had been by the time the city council planning committee met to approve the development, there would be nothing to prevent the owners repurposing it as co-living or student accommodation beyond a simple <a href="https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200130/common_projects/9/change_of_use/2">change of use class</a>.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="centre-for-cities-average-house-price-change-2010-2018.png" alt="Average house price change 2010-2018 - Centre for Cities bar chart" width="800" height="757"> Average house price change 2010-2018.

It also specifies minimum widths for bedrooms and minimum floor areas for storage, which it says are “an integral part of the space standard” and “cannot be used in isolation from other parts of the design standard or removed from it”.</p><p>The proposed Harlequins co-living block would contain 26 cluster flats, with between four and seven bedspaces in each, as well as 99 studio flats of which fourteen are designed to be accessible to wheelchair users, altogether providing 251 bedspaces. There is no indication in the application documents that sharing bedspaces will be prohibited. As studios in the <a href="https://freshstudentliving.co.uk/property/queen-street/overview/">Queen Street block managed by Fresh Property Group</a> are advertised as suitable for sharers there seems no reason to expect the Harlequins bedspaces to be limited to single occupation.</p><p>None of the proposed Harlequins cluster flats or studios would meet the national minimum space standard, whether singly-occupied or otherwise. According to the submitted plans, the cluster flat bedspaces would be typically 2.5 metres wide by 5 metres long, including a corner shower and toilet space, while the studios would be typically 3 metres wide by 6 metres long, including a corner shower space and toilet as well as a kitchenette.</p><p>The national minimum space standard for a one person dwelling is 37 square metres (if it has a shower instead of a bath).

Living spaces should be better than the equivalent of a hotel room. Approval of such small living spaces will set a dangerous precedent.”</p><p>Diana Moore added: “The report sets out no reason for the recommended departure from the nationally described space standards. We have to remember these are intended as primary, permanent homes not accommodation for nine months.”</p><h3 id="amenity--flexibility">Amenity &amp; flexibility</h3><p>The city council planning officer sought to justify the proposed co-living block’s failure to meet the national space standard on the grounds that its residents “would have the benefit of shared facilities”, which he emphasised would be provided on all floors of the building. Following reductions to amenity space included in previous plan iterations, these facilities amount to two rooms on the lower ground floor of the block, two more on the ground floor, and one each on the upper ground and first to fifth floors, all of which would also be kitchens.</p><p>If the building’s 251 bedspaces were limited to one occupant each, this would offer each resident an extra 2.7 square metres of space. However on several upper floors only 42 square metres of amenity space would be shared between more than 50 bedspaces. The planning officer’s report also failed to mention that the <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KvxqE2Mn0yOqR9yAbOZuOjZ/2/498635/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">proposed co-living management plan</a> said that the building’s communal spaces would be available for private hire.</p><p>In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, not only would these combined communal spaces be limited to supplying safely-distanced space for just 53 people in total, the floor plans show long corridors which are only 1.5 metres wide and so too narrow to pass others at a safe distance.

This is despite city council planning policies including a <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents/residential-design-guide-spd/">Residential Design Guide</a>, which was introduced in 2010 to define the council’s minimum design standards for new residential development. As well as setting space standards (which the Harlequins redevelopment proposals do not meet), the policy defines “fit for purpose” building design which it says applies to “all dwellings” and “will be applied consistently”.</p><p>It says: “Without minimum standards, private house builders tend to minimise room sizes so reducing flexibility and adaptability. As the pressure for increased densities grows the requirement for minimum standards is ever more important. All dwellings, including conversions, should have sufficient space to create comfortable homes, without people living on top of each other.</p><p>“They should be adaptable to occupiers’ changing needs over time, and have sufficient space and storage to accommodate sufficient furniture and equipment to enable comfortable living. Space standards are an important factor in delivering sustainable development.”</p><p>In her foreword to the guide, Labour councillor <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=813">Rachel Sutton</a>, who was then Executive Portfolio Holder for Sustainable Development and Transport, said: “Houses and flats should be built to last, have generous space to meet the requirements of modern living and be adaptable as people’s needs change through life.” She said the guide “clearly outlines the criteria by which all housing proposals are assessed, from an individual house to the largest estate”.</p><p>The guide goes on to say it “explains the principles that developers should adopt and the procedures that should be followed to meet the challenge of designing higher density development without compromising design quality or residential amenity. Recent trends in house building have seen the development of some dwellings which are far too small to be sustainable. These designs are inflexible and not able to meet the changing needs of people over time.”</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="student-accommodation-lower-ground-floor-plan-amenity.jpg" alt="Harlequins co-living block lower ground floor plan showing amenity space" width="1920" height="1262"> <a href="student-accommodation-lower-ground-floor-plan-amenity.jpg" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Harlequins co-living block lower ground floor plan showing amenity space.

It did not explain how the 2.7 square metres of communal space provided per bedspace addresses the amenity requirements set out in the council’s planning policies, or how the design of the co-living block makes it adaptable to its occupiers’ changing needs over time.</p><p>At the planning committee meeting that approved the Harlequins proposals, Rachel Sutton described the city as “moving into a new phase” with the redevelopment, saying “life is a lot easier” when you can “move from one rented flat or bedsit to another in the back of your mate’s car because your possessions probably fit into a couple of bin bags”.

We asked Exeter City Council for evidence of such demand in Exeter but it declined to supply any. We also asked Exeter City Council to identify local examples of bespoke new high-quality, managed rental accommodation that are not purpose built student accommodation, but it again declined to do so.</p><h3 id="housing-supply">Housing supply</h3><p>In addition to conflating supply with demand, the Harlequins developer <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KjSh6aRWo892zatUNs6HEMo9N18oYaI/2/482593/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">claimed</a> that the co-living block would increase the supply of housing in Exeter, not by delivering new housing itself, but by “freeing up existing capacity” and “reducing pressure on traditional houses in the city” to “free up these homes to allow families to live there, rebalancing the mix of communities in the area”.</p><p>Claiming “significant parallels” with a <a href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewDocument.aspx?fileid=35566334">2019 appeal decision</a> in which a planning inspector allowed the construction of a 166-bed student accommodation block at Walnut Gardens on St David’s Hill, the <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KmpyhgudmfEG9V5U3PtEp6iF8c/2/498550/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">developer said</a> the proposed Harlequins co-living block would contribute to the council’s housing delivery targets, which are set by the government, “through reallocation of some residents moving from established dwellings to the scheme”.</p><p>However the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-delivery-test">Housing Delivery Test</a> which the government uses to assess the extent to which development supplies housing to meet local targets explicitly refers to dwellings as defined in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-statistics-and-england-housing-survey-glossary/a-to-z">MHCLG guidance</a>, which says: “A home or dwelling in the <em>Housing supply; net additional dwellings statistics</em> is defined in line with the census definition, which defines a dwelling as a self-contained unit of accommodation. Self-containment is where all the rooms (including kitchen, bathroom and toilet) in a household’s accommodation are behind a single door which only that household can use.”</p><p>It continues: “Communal establishments, i.e. establishments providing managed residential accommodation, are not counted in overall housing supply”. Student accommodation is explicitly defined as a form of communal establishment, and the definition also says that purpose-built flats are only counted in housing supply calculations if they are separate, self-contained dwellings.</p><p>The shared amenity and kitchen spaces on which the Harlequins proposals rely to justify their failure to meet minimum space, amenity and design standards entail that none of the planned cluster flats or studios qualify as separate, self-contained dwellings according to the government’s definition, and so would not be counted for the purposes of <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/728523/HDT_Measurement_Rule_Book.pdf">housing supply measurement</a>. A dwelling cannot be both self-contained and dependent on communal space at the same time.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="purpose-built-student-accommodation-bampfylde-street.jpg" alt="Purpose Built Student Accommodation on Bampfylde Street" width="800" height="533"> Purpose Built Student Accommodation on Bampfylde Street</p><p>An attempt by the developer’s agent to refute this definition <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KUNqJyJxp48EC1uREZ2O7smuBpyn/2/513719/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">made on the day of the planning committee meeting</a> unintentionally pointed towards the pertinence of the government’s definition. The agent cited <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-supply-and-delivery#counting-other-forms-of-accommodation">2019 government guidance on the Housing Delivery Test</a>, quoting the first sentence of a section concerning student accommodation: “All student accommodation, whether it consists of communal halls of residence or self-contained dwellings, and whether or not it is on campus, can in principle count towards contributing to an authority’s housing land supply.”</p><p>However, apart from the fact that the developer insists that the Harlequins co-living block would not be student accommodation, which is the form of accommodation to which this guidance applies, the agent failed to quote the rest of the guidance, which included the qualification that it could apply to purpose-built studio flats, but only when they fully function as independent dwellings.</p><p>In an <a href="https://cornerstonebarristers.com/cmsAdmin/uploads/appeal-decision-3227226_.pdf">appeal decision concerning a co-living block in Feltham</a> earlier this year, a planning inspector clarified the functional characteristics necessary to qualify as an independent dwelling, which include the provision of private external space and independent access to and from each dwelling, as well as not relying on communal facilities such as shared kitchens.</p><p>Despite the city council planning officer’s report supplying no evidence that the co-living block would contribute to housing supply numbers, and despite clear government guidance and case law to the contrary, the planning officer said that Exeter City Council nevertheless agreed with the developer’s claim that the co-living block would supply housing to meet its government-set delivery targets, and so counted this as one of the benefits of the application.</p><h3 id="affordable-housing-provision">Affordable housing provision</h3><p>On the basis that the co-living block would provide dwellings, the council planning officer then stated that the Exeter <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/planning-policy/local-plan/core-strategy-development-plan-document/">Core Strategy</a> policy on the provision of affordable housing would apply. This says: “On sites capable of providing three or more additional dwellings (irrespective of the number of dwellings proposed) 35% of the total housing provision should be made available as affordable housing for households whose housing needs are not met by the market. At least 70% of the affordable housing should be provided as social rented housing.”</p><p>Exeter also has an <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents/affordable-housing-spd/">Affordable Housing policy</a> which provides <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/1654/affordable-housing-spd-april-2014.pdf">more detailed guidance</a> on how the core strategy policy will be implemented. This says: “The requirement to provide affordable housing will apply to all proposals for residential development, including new build, conversions and mixed use schemes” as well as “schemes involving non-self contained dwellings and the sharing of amenities”.</p><p>However, the council planning officer went to say that only 20% of the co-living block would need to be affordable housing, on the basis that the block constituted a Build To Rent development so <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/build-to-rent">specific NPPF guidance</a> would apply instead. The NPPF considers Built to Rent as an “asset class within the private rented sector” and says that such schemes “should meet any relevant local and national planning policy requirements”.</p><blockquote><p>“The sheer inability to be packaged and compartmentalised into an easily digestible definition is one of coliving’s greatest strengths.”</p><p><a href="https://residential.jll.co.uk/insights/opinions/co-living-co-living-coliving">Richard Lustigman, JLL director</a></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7747/">most commonly referred to definition of affordable housing</a> is set out in the NPPF, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/annex-2-glossary">which says</a> the rent must be “at least 20% below local market rents”. The approval condition recommended by the planning officer does not prevent the scheme operator charging 80% of the rent levels in the rest of the block, which are likely to be double typical Exeter rates, as these would be the only other co-living rents in the city at the time of opening and so constitute the local market rents referred to in the definition.</p><p>And the approval condition only gives “first priority” for these discounted bedspaces to essential local workers, which presumably means that others will be free to take them if key workers do not fill them as they become available. As <a href="https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14819">one third of key workers earn £10 an hour or less</a> and the lowest NHS pay band for a nurse is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52312038">under £20,000 a year</a>, the bedspaces are likely to remain unaffordable for most such workers in any case.</p><p>Michael Mitchell, calling the development a “poorly thought through scheme” that “doesn’t constitute housing, or providing a home” said: “If this development had been about providing 20-30 year-olds with affordable rented housing in the city centre I’d have both hands in the air. It is not.”</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="build-to-rent-or-sui-generis">Build to Rent or <em>Sui generis</em>?</h3><p>Build to Rent is not a “<a href="https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200130/common_projects/9/change_of_use">use class</a>” in its own right for planning purposes, so is <a href="https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/insights/build-to-rent-in-the-revised-nppf.html">usually dealt with under the C3 designation</a> for residential dwellings.</p><p><em>Sui generis</em> is a planning term for uses which are specifically defined and excluded from use classification by legislation.

To what extent would the proposed Harlequins redevelopment deliver these aims?</p><h3 id="streetscape">Streetscape</h3><p>A striking feature of the Harlequins site is the spiral vehicle ramp which feeds the Guildhall shopping centre multi-storey car park on the other side of Paul Street, described by Historic England as “cutting through the site”. The existing Harlequins development was constructed around this ramp when it was built in the mid-1980s, and the redevelopment plans have followed the same approach despite the existence of two street-level vehicle entrances to the Guildhall shopping centre on Paul Street.</p><p>The decision to integrate the ramp into the Harlequins redevelopment appears to cement the Guildhall shopping centre multi-storey car park, and the poor quality public realm that comes with it, into the fabric of the city despite the commitment to replace it with human-scale street frontage including shops, offices and housing framed in the <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/4459/a-city-centre-vision-for-a-green-capital-april-2011.pdf">Exeter City Centre Vision for a Green Capital</a>.</p><p>The redevelopment proposals include moving the car park barrier to street level in order to reduce queueing on the ramp. The developer <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/K9k5znHROqb7Pl1JBtbcTH8SD6ERTS/2/482583/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">claimed this would reduce vehicle emissions</a>, without explaining how, despite going on to say “the impact of the scheme would not be significant in air quality terms”. Keith Lewis said: “The proposed location [of the barrier] only allows for one car to queue before obtaining a ticket for entry. This could have a negative impact upon traffic in Paul Street if a small number of motorists are tempted to wait for the barrier to rise, and block through traffic.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="guildhall-car-park-ramp-entrance-and-exit-paul-street.jpg" alt="Guildhall car park ramp entrance and exit at Harlequins shopping centre" width="800" height="450"> Guildhall car park ramp entrance and exit at Harlequins shopping centre</p><p>Devon County Council, <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/K9k5znHROqb7Pl1JBtbcTH8SD6ERTS/2/482583/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">responding to the application</a> in its role as Local Highways Authority, said: “In the rare times when the car park becomes full additional signage would re-divert traffic elsewhere to other car parks in the city.” It described the use of signage as a “forward-thinking concept” which “would aim to change people’s behavioural patterns in the interest of creating a greener and more sustainable approach to how the public interaction [sic] with the city.”</p><p>The proposals also include removing the car park queue filter lanes in both directions.

At crossings and junctions, cyclists should not share the space used by pedestrians but should be provided with a separate parallel route.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="guildhall-car-park-ramp-access-paul-street-filter-lanes.jpg" alt="Guildhall car park ramp access filter lanes in Paul Street with ramp flyover in background" width="800" height="450"> Guildhall car park ramp access filter lanes in Paul Street with ramp flyover in background</p><p>Alex Tait of Exeter Cycling Campaign <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/Kec4gqeqK4wWQLjkHNauusoCQ41j/2/506758/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">said</a>: “The shared path proposed alongside the development is no longer compliant with national design guidance”.

Although the building will be set back it will nonetheless be significantly taller than the existing structure, and therefore, the visual relief offered by the lower form of the existing Harlequin Centre will be lost.”</p><p>Despite subsequent revisions, the plans still include a seven storey tower which would be three storeys taller than the Guildhall shopping centre beside it. Exeter City Council’s planning officer nevertheless described the proposed redevelopment as “a stepping stone between the very large grain of the Guildhall shopping centre to the south and the fine grain of the residential areas to the north and west”, and the developer claimed it would reduce the existing Paul Street “canyon effect”.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="hotel-student-accommodation-rendered-elevations-guildhall-car-park-ramp.jpg" alt="Harlequins co-living block elevation showing Guildhall car park ramp and 'urban oasis garden'" width="1920" height="1080"> <a href="hotel-student-accommodation-rendered-elevations-guildhall-car-park-ramp.jpg" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Harlequins co-living block elevation showing Guildhall car park ramp and ‘urban oasis garden’.

In other words, would it have passed the “non-weighted balance test”?</p><p>Relying on the city council heritage officer’s conclusion there would be less than substantial harm to the setting of heritage assets, the city council planning officer’s report summarised the scheme’s principal benefits as follows: “</p><ul><li>economic growth in the form of job creation and expenditure in the city centre</li><li>delivery of housing to help with the council’s lack of five year housing supply</li><li>provision of affordable housing</li><li>significant public realm improvement works along Paul Street and on the corner of Paul Street and Queen Street</li><li>improved public access and setting of the city wall, with ‘interpretation centre’</li><li>new architecturally distinctive/energy efficient buildings with active frontages facing onto Paul Street</li><li>biodiversity net gain of 616%</li><li>remediation of contaminated land; and</li><li>reduction in surface water flow from the site.”</li></ul><p>It also noted £25,000 contributions towards city wall management, maintenance, repair and promotion and £100,000 for “public open spaces within the area” to compensate for the lack of outdoor amenity space included in the development, but did not address the inclusion of heritage benefits on both sides of the “non-weighted balance test”.</p><p>The report concluded that the “non-weighted balance test” had been satisfied, and said: “There are no adverse impacts of the scheme that are considered to significantly and demonstrably outweigh the economic, social and environmental benefits of the scheme when considering the NPPF as a whole.”</p><p>Diana Moore said: “The harm caused to the setting of the heritage assets requires clear and convincing justification, but the developer has failed to justify the harm that will occur on the wider area and heritage assets. It is claimed the public benefits of the scheme outweigh this level of harm, but this has not been fully justified. In particular I am concerned at the number of times the report recommends setting aside material conflicts with national guidance, standards or the council’s own policies.”</p><blockquote><p>“I am convinced this development will have a positive impact on the conservation area.”</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/186668925633/videos/2801209653458404">Phil Bialyk, Exeter City Council leader</a></p></blockquote><p class="uk-dropcap">The Harlequins redevelopment consultation generated 383 <a href="http://publicaccess.exeter.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=Q0LEDJHBM3F00">comments from the public</a>, of which 99% were objections. John Allan said: “Like many Exeter residents I remain appalled by this greedy development proposal.” Rebecca Wells said: “It is a solid, brutal, overbearing block which could be anywhere. Such a building in the heart of Exeter is completely inappropriate.” Andrew Simson added: “The developers are obviously trying to cram as many people as possible into a very cramped environmment. The motivation for this is obviously to make as much money as possible and as fast as possible and can hardly be said to be in the interests of locals.”</p><p>Vanessa Cecil said: “It would ruin a historic area of Exeter and render it no different from numerous other unattractive city centres. Not only is this utterly unwanted but it is unnecessary. Proper, decent housing is required, not units tantamount to student accommodation.” Jean Baker said: “We need housing for residents […] real accommodation for those who could help to regenerate this rapidly declining city. The de-facto outcome will be that the whole building will become student accommodation.”</p><p>Marsha Hunt said: “Young residents are the future of our city. They deserve more than a space in a hall of residence to start their working life.” Penelope Dodd added: “Exeter is in danger of becoming a city of vast accommodation blocks. We should be enhancing these areas with mixed residential areas so that people can work, bring up families, bring back the heart to this city.”</p><p>Dr Shaun Curtis said: “This city centre site is too sensitive for the imposition of featureless and derivative architecture, especially at the scale proposed. We need a completely different approach, where the development team is forced to think imaginatively about design and context, rather than returns on capital employed and the maximisation of residential development margins.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="indicative-view-relative-building-heights-exeter-guildhall-car-park.png" alt="Indicative view of relative building heights from Guildhall car park top deck" width="800" height="463"> Indicative view of relative building heights from Guildhall car park top deck.

The petition was presented by organiser Andy Robinson on behalf of the campaign to the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=6253">July city council meeting</a>, where a full debate on the issue was expected in accordance with the city’s <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/consultations-and-petitions/petitions/">petition scheme</a>. It was, however, controversially referred to the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=116&amp;MId=6230">September planning committee meeting</a> by the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1396">Lord Mayor</a> on <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49992">the grounds</a> that Mr Robinson, in presenting the petition, had mentioned the planning application which was the petition’s subject.</p><p>The petitioners urged the council to research and develop new policies to safeguard Exeter against inappropriate development, including a comprehensive housing needs assessment and policies to address affordable housing, co-living, student accommodation, conservation areas and heritage assets. Andy Robinson said: “There are huge gaps in planning policy. We have seen many buildings going up without any respect for historic Exeter, bringing no public benefit and only benefiting investors who are, in most cases, not based in our city and may not even be in the UK.</p><p>“Exeter City Council, it seems, does not have the resources to give them proper scrutiny; developers’ claims and conclusions therefore have to be taken at face value and, inevitably, what is proposed is overwhelmingly about profit. It is not concerned about protecting Exeter, its heritage and its long term vision and it certainly is not about benefitting the people who live here.”</p><p>Daniel Rudham, a resident who backed the petition, said: “The thousands who have signed the petition say: stop; listen to the people who live and work here. The council must make sure that there are planning rules to ensure Exeter develops in ways which protects our heritage and environment and addresses the needs of local people. It’s clear that the council lacks the resources and policies to deal with the threat of international developers taking advantage. But they need to make proper use of the powers they do have to ensure architecturally imaginative buildings worthy of a historically important city are built.”</p><p>Joy Wrightson, a local resident, said: “Large new developments designed to make the developers rich but which bring little to the city in terms of amenity or architectural value are already beginning to dominate the central skyline. We want the council to have properly up to date policies so that control of planning isn’t always in the hands of the developers and consultation with residents is more than a tick box exercise.”</p><p>Diana Moore, who presented the Save Our Historic Exeter petition to the planning committee in September, said: “4000 signatures demonstrate the strength of feeling on how thoughtless development is damaging our great city but not providing the homes we need. There is a growing feeling among Exeter residents that development isn’t benefiting people who live in the city or creating thriving communities.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="student-accommodation-indicative-view-outside-amenity-space.png" alt="Indicative view of outside amenity space beside co-living block lower ground floor" width="800" height="490"> Indicative view of outside amenity space beside co-living block lower ground floor.<br>Image: <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/Kmnt1YfDgTa80oGbmQHJjyYXxINtjCQb/2/505204/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">LHC Design</a>.</p><p>Exeter City Council published a <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=46967&amp;PlanId=203&amp;RPID=9480389">decision notice in August</a> which said it would define its policy position on student accommodation and co-living at the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6204">October Executive committee meeting</a>, and Phil Bialyk <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/leader-column-how-we-will-create-balanced-and-sustainable-communities/">confirmed in September</a> that a co-living policy was in prospect. Had the Executive done as planned, the city council would have ratified its decision at its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=6252">meeting later that month</a>, the week before the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=116&amp;MId=6648">planning committee meeting</a> that decided the Harlequins application was held.</p><p>We asked Exeter City Council why this decision was not taken at the meetings as announced, and when it would be taken instead. We were told: “The matter was withdrawn as the appropriate way to develop new policy is through the local plan process and we will therefore be developing such a policy as part of the new local plan in due course.” We also asked why the development of this policy was not mentioned in the officer’s report to the planning committee, and were told: “The existing policy framework was set out within the report and provides the correct framework for determining the application.”</p><p>However, the delivery of most of the planning policy documents that make up Exeter’s <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/planning-policy/monitoring-and-evidence-base/">Local Development Scheme</a> has been been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the <a href="https://www.gesp.org.uk/">Greater Exeter Strategic Plan</a> stalled this summer, specific supplementary planning documents such as the Code for Sustainable Homes that was promised in 2019 have been “paused pending the outcome of the Government’s Future Homes Standard consultation” and the government is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/planning-for-the-future">in the middle of a consultation on planning reform</a> which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/05/englands-planning-reforms-will-create-generation-of-slums">threatens to turn the current system on its head</a>, introducing a completely new local plan production and adoption process.</p><blockquote><p>“If this development had been about providing 20-30 year-olds with affordable rented housing in the city centre I’d have both hands in the air. It is not.”</p><p>Michael Mitchell, Exeter councillor</p></blockquote><p>Under the current system, it takes <a href="https://www.davidlock.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-adopt-a-local-plan/">an average of nineteen months</a> simply to adopt a local plan, with <a href="https://cp.catapult.org.uk/2020/08/17/how-are-local-plans-performing-a-data-and-mapping-analysis/">some taking as long as five years</a>. And that is without factoring in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-plans">multiple earlier stages in local plan development</a>, which also take years. It would be foolhardy to bet on when a new Exeter Local Plan might be adopted, but it looks like a racing certainty that the city will not have adopted new policies on co-living or student accommodation at least until after the Harlequins redevelopment has been completed, which is currently scheduled for 2022.</p><p>Diana Moore said: “This is the first co-living development to be determined by the council. The council does not have policies which provide a basis for determining a co-living application, which at this point is no more than an ill-defined brand. Other local planning authorities have sought to address this weakness by adopting specific co-living policies. There is no reason Exeter City Council should not do so too.”</p><p>Keith Lewis said: “We would like the council to move quickly to develop supplementary planning guidance, like some other cities, to set a minimum and decent standard for co-living accommodation and would urge that no such accommodation is approved in the city until standards are adopted.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-city-wall-northernhay-street-historic-housing.jpg" alt="Harlequins shopping centre in context with Exeter city wall and Northernhay Street housing" width="800" height="450"> Harlequins shopping centre in context with Exeter city wall and Northernhay Street housing</p><p>One such example is the <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/new-london-plan/what-new-london-plan">new London Plan</a>, which includes a <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/intend_to_publish_-_clean.pdf">policy on co-living development</a> which, despite not being formally adopted, nevertheless carries significant planning weight and constitutes a material consideration in planning decisions. If defines what it calls Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living and sets out minimum requirements for adequately functional living space and layout and, because it is not considered suitable as a form of affordable housing itself, requires developers to pay cash in lieu contributions towards conventional affordable housing provision off site.</p><p>Manchester City Council also adopted <a href="https://democracy.manchester.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=17815">policy on co-living</a> earlier this year, which it introduced as a material planning consideration on an interim basis despite itself being in the middle of the development of a new local plan. It followed a comprehensive two stage consultation and was based on a <a href="https://democracy.manchester.gov.uk/documents/s12248/Co-living.pdf">report which included extensive comparative research</a> into co-living development and policy elsewhere which sought to clarify the extent to which its own policy should be based on specific local considerations. Residents of St David’s <a href="http://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/K1Kw9qDfJLTy2zaYD9gzxac/2/489553/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">submitted the report</a> to Exeter City Council during the Harlequins consultation.</p><p>The policy included several notable provisions, including that co-living schemes “must demonstrate that they command support from recently arrived or new employers” located nearby, with the size and scale of the developments “underpinned by the generation of employment opportunities from those employers” and a “robust justification demonstrating evidenced need” provided for each scheme which showed a “clear link between the need to recruit and retain staff” and the development.</p><p>Co-living schemes in Manchester are also required to demonstrate how they comply with the city council’s adopted space standards. They must only accommodate “working households, or households actively seeking work” and prohibit “letting to students”, must impose maximum stays on short-term studio lets (the example given is six months), must charge affordable rents and include a “conversion plan to demonstrate how the building could be repurposed”. They cannot directly contribute to the delivery of affordable housing targets, so must indirectly do so via cash in lieu contributions.</p><blockquote><p>“We would like the council to move quickly to develop supplementary planning guidance, like some other cities, to set a minimum and decent standard for co-living accommodation and would urge that no such accommodation is approved in the city until standards are adopted.”</p><p>Keith Lewis, Exeter Civic Society</p></blockquote><p>We asked Exeter City Council why the planning officer’s report on the Harlequins application did not consider or refer to any other local authority policies or their supporting research, and were told, despite Manchester City Council having done so, that “it would not be appropriate to refer to a policy derived from another authority as the evidence base for their policy will not be the same as for Exeter.”</p><p>Manchester City Council’s policy development research also warned that co-living has important implications for council tax, including collection risks due to short tenures and revenue risks from high proportions of low-banded cluster flats in such developments. The city’s resulting policy accordingly requires co-living operators to take responsibility for council tax collection risks and pay the council directly for each block.</p><p>Exeter City Council’s planning officer mentioned council tax just once in his report, simply saying: “The co-living block will generate council tax”, but the management plan submitted with the application makes clear that individual tenants, and not the operator, would be responsible for payments. We asked Exeter City Council why the risks to council tax revenues in co-living developments were not identified and addressed in the officer’s report, but it declined to respond.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="paul-street-guildhall-car-park.jpg" alt="Harlequins shopping centre in context with Paul Street and Guildhall car park" width="800" height="450"> Harlequins shopping centre in context with Paul Street and Guildhall car park</p><p class="uk-dropcap">Had Exeter City Council adopted a formal co-living policy before its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=116&amp;MId=6648">October planning committee meeting</a>, even only as an interim measure as other local planning authorities have, its decision might have been different. At it was, the city council planning officer’s report recommended approval and the committee followed suit.</p><p>Mary Chichester of Save Our Historic Exeter spoke at the meeting, identifying many of the material flaws in the application. She said: “The proposed seven storey tower block in the core of Exeter’s central conservation area will completely overshadow surrounding three and four storey listed buildings. It will also dwarf the Roman city wall, a national monument, the impact on which, astonishingly, the council heritage report says is a ‘slight negative’.</p><p>“There is no such category as a ‘slight negative’ impact recognised in the NPPF. This report finds that the level of harm to most of the listed buildings in Northernhay Street and Square is ‘moderate to substantial adverse’. It is claimed that the public benefits of this scheme outweigh this level of harm but nowhere is this claim justified. Therefore, such a conclusion is not warranted.</p><p>“Hundreds of Exeter residents have expressed strong objections and over 4000 people have signed the Save Our Historic Exeter petition. The Georgian Group, The Victorian Society, Exeter Civic Society and many local historians have concluded unanimously that the proposal will harm the city’s heritage assets. Even the council’s own heritage officer agrees that the proposal will cause harm to the many listed buildings on Northernhay Street and Queen Street, including RAMM.</p><p>“His heritage report states repeatedly that there will be harm and impact, but then dismisses it as ‘less than substantial’ fourteen times. The cumulative impact on the conservation area <em>must</em> qualify as substantial harm.”</p><blockquote><p>“It is claimed that the public benefits of this scheme outweigh this level of harm but nowhere is this claim justified.”</p><p>Mary Chichester, Save Our Historic Exeter</p></blockquote><p>When invited to ask questions about the content of Mary Chichester’s speech the members of the planning committee remained silent. In contrast, they asked more than a dozen questions of Chris Dadds, who was introduced as a public speaker despite being the developer’s agent. When asked whether the developer would safeguard damage to the city wall or any other nearby listed buildings, he said it would “ensure, as best anyone is able, that any damage is minimised, avoided and mitigated”. When asked about the likely length of co-living tenancies, he was unable to supply an answer, but did confirm that there would be no maximum lease length.</p><p>Diana Moore, who is not a member of the planning committee, attended to speak on behalf of St David’s ward residents. She said: “The proposed design, scale and mass of the co-living tower block or hotel will not make a positive contribution to the local character of either conservation area and the excessive height and mass of both buildings will be overbearing on significant designated heritage assets, particularly to the areas facing the city wall.</p><p>“This is an ideal site for new housing, however agreeing this plan for this site would open out similar sites for more ad hoc development that will further undermine housing supply. We know that Exeter has a real shortage of affordable housing. At 20% affordable ‘room’ (not housing), with none supplied at social rent levels and no offsite alternative provision, this proposal fails to go any way towards meeting those needs.”</p><p><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1889">Luke Sills</a>, a Labour councillor for St David’s who was unable to attend the meeting due to illness, asked Diana Moore to speak on his behalf.

Watkins Jones PLC is also behind this development, which will see a six storey block that contains 133 co-living bedspaces loom over adjacent two storey terraces on Sandford Walk and elsewhere behind.</p><p>The city council planning officer’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s76069/19-1417-FUL%20Final%20Officer%20Report.pdf">report</a> followed the template set by the Harlequins decision, accepting economic impact claims at face value, requiring affordable housing provision in only 20% of the development, considering the plans as Build to Rent and <em>sui generis</em> at the same time, ignoring council tax revenue risks and accepting that the provision of just over three square metres of communal space per bed will compensate for studios that do not meet national minimum space standards. The Gladstone Road development was also originally presented as purpose built student accommodation.</p><blockquote><p>“Co-living is an experimental concept that is gambling with people’s lives. It is an approach that seeks to maximise profits by squeezing as many people as possible into spaces that fail to meet national space standards. What this area of the city desperately needs is a mix of homes including affordable family homes.”</p><p>Jemima Moore, Exeter councillor</p></blockquote><p>96% of <a href="http://publicaccess.exeter.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&amp;keyVal=PZ7SE4HBLJR00">134 public consultation responses</a> to this development were objections, with only two in support. Reflecting the views of many objectors, <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5823">Jemima Moore</a>, independent councillor for the Newtown and St Leonard’s ward where the development will take place, said: “Co-living is an experimental concept that is gambling with people’s lives. It is an approach that seeks to maximise profits by squeezing as many people as possible into spaces that fail to meet national space standards. What this area of the city desperately needs is a mix of homes including affordable family homes.”</p><p>Michael Mitchell added: “The design of these miniscule rooms reveals developers are just rebranding student accommodation in a way which enables developers to avoid paying developer levies. If they are genuinely intended for essential workers, they are an insult. Especially since there is no stipulation that even the smallest rooms are for single occupancy. Couples could find themselves trying to live in a room which is only eighteen feet square. These living spaces represent little more than hotel rooms, which might be fine for a few nights, but represent cramped living for the longer term and are unfit for a decent quality of life.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="gladstone-road-co-living-block-rendered-comparative-elevations.jpg" alt="Gladstone Road co-living block rendered comparative elevations" width="800" height="450"> Gladstone Road co-living block rendered comparative elevations.

They present the bedspaces it provides as homes despite them neither meeting national minimum space standards nor supplying sufficient amenity or future flexibility to meet planning policy guidelines.</p><p>They conflate supply with demand, and density with size. They contradict government definitions to claim that co-living units would contribute to the council’s housing supply targets, and rely on <em>sui generis</em> classification to minimise affordable housing provision requirements despite Build to Rent normally constituting residential development.</p><p>Their economic impact claims don’t stand up to scrutiny, with the lion’s share of the spending generated by the development not benefiting the city, and they propose minor improvements to public realm in the immediate vicinity of the buildings as sufficient to offset significant harm to heritage assets that would be caused by the scheme.</p><p>And Exeter City Council, which has chosen not to pass its own co-living policy despite the significant weight such a policy could have in planning decisions, agrees with the developers despite near-unanimous opposition from the community and conservation charities.</p><p>As local resident Marsha Hunt said: “Exeter city centre is in real danger of becoming a large extended university campus and ignoring and excluding its permanent residents who have strong or long reaching ties to the city. After each tranche of students have left, the residents remain and it’s the residents who take care of the city, volunteer, create and bring up families, create communities and it’s those communities that are being ignored in favour of another huge global development company with no real ties to this city and purely profit at the heart of its motivation.”</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="liveable-exeter-transformational-housing-delivery-programme-exeter-city-centre-vision-green-capital-north-gate.jpg" alt="Liveable Exeter North Gate redevelopment vision with North Street illustration and City Centre Vision for a Green Capital illustration" width="1517" height="821"> <a href="liveable-exeter-transformational-housing-delivery-programme-exeter-city-centre-vision-green-capital-north-gate.jpg" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Liveable Exeter North Gate redevelopment vision (left) with North Street illustration (bottom right) and City Centre Vision for a Green Capital illustration (top right).

If he does not overrule the current plans for the site, the rash of purpose built student accommodation that has erupted in Exeter in recent years looks set to be followed by a spate of functionally and aesthetically indistinguishable co-living developments which are likely to offer substandard short-term accommodation and do nothing to address Exeter’s affordable housing needs.</p><p>When asked recently about the status of Exeter’s <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/4459/a-city-centre-vision-for-a-green-capital-april-2011.pdf">City Centre Vision for a Green Capital</a>, on which the <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/4460/liveable-exeter-a-transformational-housing-delivery-programme-february-2019.pdf">Liveable Exeter</a> “Transformational Housing Delivery Programme” for the North Gate area of the city centre is based, Exeter City Council said the document “is a vision and not an action plan”.

Last month <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=2336">the Executive decided</a> to <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=50542">increase council housing rents by the maximum allowed by law</a>, but <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=48050">last year’s decision</a> to do the same thing was <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=2208">taken by the full council</a> instead.</p><p>It’s hardly surprising that councillors are confused about the rules.

Full council meetings are not there to make minor budget alterations or variations to existing policies, and are certainly not there to take decisions which do not affect the budget or policy framework at all.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-city-council-in-session-at-exeter-guildhall.jpg" alt="Exeter City Council in session at Exeter Guildhall" width="800" height="450"> Exeter City Council in session at Exeter Guildhall.

The other fourteen will be taken by the county council’s cabinet, the equivalent of the city council’s executive.</p><p>These include the adoption of a wide range of plans and strategies as well as the approval of various capital budgets and infrastructure scheme proposals. County council financial reporting and monitoring is all also dealt with by its cabinet.</p><p>The city council does things the other way round. Its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgListPlanItems.aspx?PlanId=262&amp;RP=112">February forward plan</a> lists 29 decisions to be taken over the next three months of which 22 are to be taken at full council meetings.</p><p>Among these is the curiously-titled “<a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=52722&amp;PlanId=264&amp;RPID=14120307">Report of the Plant Based Task and Finish Group</a>”.

It sets its budgetary significance threshold at £1 million, although many other councils set theirs at £100,000.</p><p>But it appears to think that other decisions that are in line with the council’s policy framework and budget (leaving aside matters such as planning, licensing and audit that are dealt with by specific committees) cannot be <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2089/regulation/2">Executive decisions</a> so must be taken at full council meetings.</p><p>Three years ago a <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/courts-and-tribunals/court-of-appeal-home/">Court of Appeal</a> ruling concerning a council cabinet’s decision to adopt a ten-year sports strategy gave what <a href="https://www.localgovernmentlawyer.co.uk/governance/314-governance-a-risk-articles/43033-local-authority-duties-and-decision-making">was described</a> as “valuable guidance to local authorities on the division of functions between full council and cabinet”.</p><p><a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/296.html">The judgement</a> confirmed that all functions of local authorities (that have adopted Executive arrangements) should be exercised by their executives unless overreaching their powers, and that the scope for what constitutes overreach should be “fairly narrow”.</p><p>It said it should not simply apply to “any strategy” that “is likely to have implications for future expenditure in the event that it is implemented”, adding: “A decision which is merely likely (or even very likely) to lead to a future decision involving such expenditure [of money not provided for in the budget or capital expenditure plan] will remain the responsibility of the executive.”</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img src="exeter-city-council-cuts-executive-decision-making-scrutiny.jpg" alt="Council leader Phil Bialyk and CEO Karime Hassan contemplate cuts to Executive decision-making scrutiny in October 2019" width="800" height="450"> Council leader Phil Bialyk and CEO Karime Hassan contemplate <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/10/09/exeter-city-council-reduces-scrutiny-decision-making/">cuts to Executive decision-making scrutiny</a> in October 2019</p><p class="uk-dropcap">Notwithstanding the legislation, Exeter City Council’s approach to decision-making might at first appear more democratic, tasking full council meetings with taking all but a small subset of decisions.</p><p>But apart from the risks of taking potentially unlawful decisions, its approach also has the effect of frustrating the principles at the heart of the 2000 Local Government Act reforms, more recently reasserted in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/schedule/2">2011 Localism Act</a>.</p><p>One was that policy-making, performed at full council meetings, should be separated from (most) decision-making, performed by the Executive.</p><p>Another was that a second safeguard against Executive (or council leader) overreach should be provided by <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/22/section/9F">scrutiny committees</a> on which Executive members are not allowed to sit.</p><p>To enable backbench councillors that sit on these committees to hold Executives to account they are afforded <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/22/section/9F">legal powers</a> to “<a href="https://www.cfgs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/CfPS-Good-Scrutiny-Guide-v4-WEB-SINGLE-PAGES.pdf">call in</a>” executive decisions, delaying their implementation so they can be subjected to greater scrutiny, reconsidered and potentially overturned.</p><p>They also have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overview-and-scrutiny-statutory-guidance-for-councils-and-combined-authorities/overview-and-scrutiny-statutory-guidance-for-councils-and-combined-authorities#power-to-access-information">enhanced powers</a> to access confidential information, can <a href="https://www.cfgs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/CfPS-Good-Scrutiny-Guide-v4-WEB-SINGLE-PAGES.pdf">investigate any issue</a> which affects “the area or the area’s inhabitants” and can call councillors, council officers and representatives of external bodies to attend and give evidence, <a href="https://www.grantthornton.co.uk/globalassets/1.-member-firms/united-kingdom/pdf/publication/2021/lessons-from-public-interest-reports-2021.pdf">like parliamentary select committees</a>.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overview-and-scrutiny-statutory-guidance-for-councils-and-combined-authorities/overview-and-scrutiny-statutory-guidance-for-councils-and-combined-authorities">statutory government guidance says</a>, “the role that overview and scrutiny can play in holding an authority’s decision-makers to account makes it fundamentally important to the successful functioning of local democracy”.</p><p>But not at Exeter City Council, because scrutiny powers only have teeth when Executive functions are being discharged.

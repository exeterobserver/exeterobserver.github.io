It still owes the council more than £10 million against loans intended to deliver hundreds of new homes on sites including Clifton Hill sports centre.</p><p>The council intends to acquire the company’s assets by releasing the company from its loan obligations, leaving it to settle the company’s loan liabilities when its creditors are repaid. But it expects the resulting resale value of the surrendered Clifton Hill development site not to cover the company’s debts, with the remaining losses to be written off.</p><p>In this special report we examine the company’s financial and development delivery history, the council’s decision-making about the company and the position in which the company’s failure has left the council.</p><p>We look at council decisions to loan the company up to £44 million to finance construction and also spend £46.3 million buying the resulting housing, underwriting the company at both ends after failing to change course when new local government borrowing rules rendered the company redundant just ten weeks after it was set up.</p><p>We consider the council’s claims about the causes of the company’s failure, explore the findings of an independent review into what happened, and ask what the consequences might be for the council’s Liveable Exeter development scheme, the new Exeter Local Plan and the council’s ability to protect the city’s greenbelt.</p><p>We also ask who is responsible and who should be held responsible for the serial performance, governance and viability failings around Exeter City Living that have jeopardised the council’s finances just when it has to cut another £5 million from its budget.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img class="imageborder" src="exeter-city-living-why-relocate-to-exeter.png" alt="Homes for local people?

It would have paid £7 million more for the land, which was valued at £9 million, on which around 200 dwellings were expected, five times as many as the company said it would build on the rump.</p><p>At a build cost of £320,000 per dwelling, as per its plans for the rump, the purchase and development cost of the whole site would have been around £70 million.</p><p>Northbrook golf course, at a little over 12 acres, is larger than the whole Clifton Hill site. To finance both developments the council would have had to quadruple its total 2018-19 government borrowing, from £59 million to more than £200 million, and lend all the capital to Exeter City Living, a start-up developer without a track record that needed £150 million to get off the ground.</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><p class="uk-text-center"><img src="vaughan-road-development-site.jpg" alt="Vaughan Road development site" width="800" height="450"> <a href="https://exetercityliving.co.uk/vaughan-road/">Vaughan Road</a> development site</p><ul><li>Site owned by Exeter City Council, previously twelve council houses and a Devon County Council care home</li><li>91 flats, originally one third for private market sale, two thirds HRA</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s64893/App%20A%20-%20Business%20Case%20FINAL.%2028062018%20Corporate%20Services%20Scrutiny%20Committee.pdf">2018-19 business plan</a>: works to start June 2019, completion November 2020</li><li>Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s71404/Report%20-%20HRA%20Phase%20I.pdf">bought care home</a> for undisclosed sum, late 2019</li><li>Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s71404/Report%20-%20HRA%20Phase%20I.pdf">allocated £9.2 million HRA budget</a> to purchase all 91 completed flats, October 2019</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="exeter-city-living-2020-21-business-plan-redacted-via-freedom-of-information-request-pdf">2020-21 business plan</a>: works to start April 2020, completion March 2022</li><li>Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=49017">granted planning permission</a>, February 2020</li><li>Development contractor withdrew, scheme divided into three phases</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="exeter-city-living-2022-23-business-plan-redacted-via-freedom-of-information-request.pdf">2022-23 business plan</a>: works to start spring 2022, completion autumn 2024</li><li>Brownfield Land Release Fund award £795,568, demolition completed April 2022</li><li>Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=57277">increased HRA budget to £14.2 million for first phase alone</a>, February 2023</li><li>Phase one construction <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/work-begins-to-create-dozens-of-new-low-energy-council-homes-in-exeter/">began May 2023</a></li><li>Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=58371">increased HRA budget to £36.2 million for all three phases</a>, July 2023</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s91815/Appendix%20B%20-%20ECL.pdf">activities and achievements summary</a>: phase one (35 flats) completion due December 2024, phases two and three (56 flats) subject to viability and council instruction, phase four feasibility study for <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=54019">Rennes Tower</a> (alongside site)</li></ul></aside><p class="uk-dropcap">If any of the causes the council claims for the company’s failure presented it with existential risks, why didn’t Karime Hassan, the council’s shareholder representative, or Phil Bialyk, the council leader, or any of the company board members bring them up as they arose?</p><p>Instead they repeatedly proposed company expansion, and ever-larger loans, despite the company’s consistent failure to deliver on its business plans, or even to deliver business plans at all.</p><p>And what about other councillors? The company’s affairs have been put in front of them at many meetings in the seven years since it was mooted. Despite numerous opportunities, and prompts, to pause for thought they have repeatedly agreed proposals to spend, in total, more than £100 million supporting the company.</p><p>So perhaps we should not be surprised that when, just ten weeks after the company’s incorporation was approved, the cap that prevented local authorities borrowing to build new council housing stock was lifted, neither officers nor councillors thought to change course.</p><p>The independent review says: “It is very important to recognise that within a few months of the establishment of Exeter City Living, a key part of its rationale – development of affordable homes outside of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-revenue-account">HRA</a> ring-fence – was no longer a reason for its existence, once the HRA borrowing cap was lifted.”</p><p>It adds that this disappearance was not “replaced with a compelling justification” for the company’s retention.</p><p>The borrowing cap removal had looked possible, if not likely, <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/insight/the-hra-borrowing-cap-explained-58486">for some time before it happened</a>. Several local authorities had been lobbying the government over the cap since March the previous year, with the government first saying that “innovative” councils could bid to increase their caps, then providing £1 billion extra borrowing capacity for “areas of high affordability pressure” before removing it altogether.</p><p>The independent reviewers say that some of those they interviewed to gather evidence for their report “were of the view that a pause and review would have been helpful at that time”.

It also says that “a decision was made to take a step back, in order to look at the opportunities in a holistic and strategic way” after the cap had been lifted, but none of the opportunities that it identifies included reviewing the rationale for Exeter City Living’s existence.</p><p>The independent review says: “Since the removal of the HRA borrowing cap in October 2018, shortly after Exeter City Living’s establishment, any of these schemes could have been delivered by the council directly, as part of an HRA development programme”.</p><p>It also says that the company is “not adding value to the delivery of HRA schemes over and above that which could have been achieved through deploying the same resources as part of a directly delivered HRA development programme”.</p><p>Worse, it found that the council had incurred costs as a result of buying company-built housing that could have been avoided, and that better outcomes could have been achieved had there been “a robust process in place to ensure that the HRA is securing value for money for its investment.”</p><p>What it did not say, perhaps because it did not grasp its significance, was that from the moment the council decided to finance the company’s sales as well as its production, every penny that the council notionally earned from company interest payments and other contributions simply increased the prices it paid when it bought the company’s houses and flats.</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><p class="uk-text-center"><img src="exeter-canal-basin-development-site.jpg" alt="Exeter canal basin development site"

independent review does say that the council’s approach to capitalising the company has been “unorthodox” and that it has been “contravening basic finance principles by borrowing long-term debt to finance day to day operating activity”.</p><p>It also says the council is “effectively converting an element of debt borrowed by the council into income for the council” (in the form of charges for financial, legal and planning services), a practice it describes as “questionable”.</p><p>It also criticises the company’s financial management, not least its unrealistic revenue projections, which suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the company’s finances.</p><p>This is borne out in the company’s insistence that the council benefits from its loan interest payments and developer contributions, when these costs are included in the sale prices the council pays, and from its land purchases, when it buys its sites from the council at less than market value.</p><p>The independent review also highlights the confusion surrounding the company’s objectives, pointing out that they “have changed on several occasions, without the council taking stock”.</p><p>It says “critical shifts in the focus of Exeter City Living’s work seem to have taken place without proper consideration by members (over and above approval of the business plan), and without consideration of the tensions

challenges ranging from vacant possession, tenant relocation or third party interests that may require compulsory purchase orders, to archaeological and structural issues, planning processes and community opposition to development on specific sites.</p><p>It says the company makes assumptions about the status of sites while not keeping the council properly informed about its actions, including its bids for government <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/housing-and-planning/one-public-estate/brownfield-land-release-fund">Brownfield Land Release Fund</a> grants, without which

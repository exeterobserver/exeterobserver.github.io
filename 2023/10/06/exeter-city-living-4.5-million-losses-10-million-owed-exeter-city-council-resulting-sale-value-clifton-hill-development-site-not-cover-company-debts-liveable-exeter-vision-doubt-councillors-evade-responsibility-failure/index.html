It still owes the council more than £10 million against loans intended to deliver hundreds of new homes on sites including Clifton Hill sports centre.</p><p>The council intends to acquire the company’s assets by releasing the company from its loan obligations, leaving it to settle the company’s loan liabilities when its creditors are repaid. But it expects the resulting resale value of the surrendered Clifton Hill development site not to cover the company’s debts, with the remaining losses to be written off.</p><p>In this special report we examine the company’s financial and development delivery history, the council’s decision-making about the company and the position in which the company’s failure has left the council.</p><p>We look at council decisions to loan the company up to £44 million to finance construction and also spend £46.3 million buying the resulting housing, underwriting the company at both ends after failing to change course when new local government borrowing rules rendered the company redundant just ten weeks after it was set up.</p><p>We consider the council’s claims about the causes of the company’s failure, explore the findings of an independent review into what happened, and ask what the consequences might be for the council’s Liveable Exeter development scheme, the new Exeter Local Plan and the council’s ability to protect the city’s greenbelt.</p><p>We also ask who is responsible and who should be held responsible for the serial performance, governance and viability failings around Exeter City Living that have jeopardised the council’s finances just when it has to cut another £5 million from its budget.</p><p class="caption"><img class="imageborder" src="exeter-city-living-why-relocate-to-exeter.avif" alt="Homes for local people?

Several local authorities had been lobbying the government over the cap since March the previous year, with the government first saying that “innovative” councils could bid to increase their caps, then providing £1 billion extra borrowing capacity for “areas of high affordability pressure” before removing it altogether.</p><p>The independent reviewers say that some of those they interviewed to gather evidence for their report “were of the view that a pause and review would have been helpful at that time”. Certainly the cost of dissolving the company so soon after its incorporation would have been much lower than the loss with which the council is now faced.</p><div class="breakoutbox"><p class="caption"><img src="belle-isle-depot-development-site.avif" alt="Belle Isle depot development site" width="800" height="450"> Belle Isle depot development site</p><ul><li>Site owned by Exeter City Council, operational depot requires relocation, <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s91814/Appendix%20A%20-%20ECL.pdf">significant contamination likely</a></li><li><a href="https://belleisle.commonplace.is/">31 high specification flats and houses for private market sale</a></li><li>Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s79813/Report%20Depot%20Relocation%20-%20FINAL.pdf">agreed £3.5 million budget</a> in July 2021 for Exeter City Living to relocate depot</li><li>Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?ID=2173">agreed to sell site for £2.2 million</a> in September 2021 to Exeter City Living</li><li>Brownfield Land Release Fund award £673,417 of which £6,254 spent</li><li>Brownfield funding criteria not met, 31 March 2024 land sale/works start deadline</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="exeter-city-living-2022-23-business-plan-redacted-via-freedom-of-information-request.pdf">2022-23 business plan</a>: works to start September 2023</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s91815/Appendix%20B%20-%20ECL.pdf">activities and achievements summary</a>: planning application due</li><li><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s91665/Ruth%20Williams%20September%202023%20update.pdf">South West Water enforced restrictions</a> preventing use of Exton Road weighbridge as depot relocation site, alternative relocation site not yet identified, September 2023</li></ul></div><p>Four months after the announcement that the cap was being removed, Bindu Arjoon told an <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MID=6335#AI46149">Executive committee meeting</a> that “there was no further information required from the government on the implications of the lifting of the HRA borrowing cap”.</p><p>She then <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MID=5811#AI47797">returned to the committee in October 2019</a>, a year after the cap had been lifted, to propose an £18 million budget to purchase (for HRA stock) all the housing Exeter City Living was expected to deliver on its sites at Thornpark Rise, Bovemoors Lane, Hamlin Gardens and Vaughan Road.</p><p>Her report says the lifting of the HRA borrowing cap presented “a great opportunity” to the council. It also says that “a decision was made to take a step back, in order to look at the opportunities in a holistic and strategic way” after the cap had been lifted, but none of the opportunities that it identifies included reviewing the rationale for Exeter City Living’s existence.</p><p>The independent review says: “Since the removal of the HRA borrowing cap in October 2018, shortly after Exeter City Living’s establishment, any of these schemes could have been delivered by the council directly, as part of an HRA development programme”.</p><p>It also says that the company is “not adding value to the delivery of HRA schemes over and above that which could have been achieved through deploying the same resources as part of a directly delivered HRA development programme”.</p><p>Worse, it found that the council had incurred costs as a result of buying company-built housing that could have been avoided, and that better outcomes could have been achieved had there been “a robust process in place to ensure that the HRA is securing value for money for its investment.”</p><p>What it did not say, perhaps because it did not grasp its significance, was that from the moment the council decided to finance the company’s sales as well as its production, every penny that the council notionally earned from company interest payments and other contributions simply increased the prices it paid when it bought the company’s houses and flats.</p><div class="breakoutbox"><p class="caption"><img src="exeter-canal-basin-development-site.avif" alt="Exeter canal basin development site" width="800"

review does say that the council’s approach to capitalising the company has been “unorthodox” and that it has been “contravening basic finance principles by borrowing long-term debt to finance day to day operating activity”.</p><p>It also says the council is “effectively converting an element of debt borrowed by the council into income for the council” (in the form of charges for financial, legal and planning services), a practice it describes as “questionable”.</p><p>It also criticises the company’s financial management, not least its unrealistic revenue projections, which suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the company’s finances.</p><p>This is borne out in the company’s insistence that the council benefits from its loan interest payments and developer contributions, when these costs are included in the sale prices the council pays, and from its land purchases, when it buys its sites from the council at less than market value.</p><p>The independent review also highlights the confusion surrounding the company’s objectives, pointing out that they “have changed on several occasions, without the council taking stock”.</p><p>It says “critical shifts in the focus of Exeter City Living’s work seem to have taken place without proper consideration by members (over and above approval of the business plan), and without consideration of the tensions between them”, which it says remain “unresolved”.</p><p>The reviewers also say they heard “concerns about the lack of elected member understanding and engagement with the work of Exeter City Living, particularly in relation to those functions undertaken by the council [chief executive] as shareholder representative.”</p><div class="breakoutbox"><p class="caption"><img

issues, the independent review places site viability at the heart of the company’s development delivery failures.</p><p>It says the council and company are insufficiently co-ordinated around a host of challenges ranging from vacant possession, tenant relocation or third party interests that may require compulsory purchase orders, to archaeological and structural issues, planning processes and community opposition to development on specific sites.</p><p>It says the company makes assumptions about the status of sites while not keeping the council properly informed about its actions, including its bids for government <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/housing-and-planning/one-public-estate/brownfield-land-release-fund">Brownfield Land Release Fund</a> grants, without which most of the sites it intends to develop are not viable.</p><p>Eight of the company’s development sites have attracted a total of £7.5 million in brownfield grants, ranging from £290,000 to £2.4 million, but only two have so far satisfied the funding condition that either work has to start or the land must be sold to draw down the money.</p><p>As a result less than £1 million of this money has actually been spent, with funding condition deadlines at the end of March, less than six months from now, on most of the sites. Worse, the council has already spent £55,000 from funding awards for which it has not yet qualified.</p><p>It is now scrambling to retain the grants by preparing “delivery plans and business cases” for as many of the sites as it can while trying to negotiate deadline extensions.</p><p>Even if it succeeds, its failure to follow through thus far after being awarded 10% of the national brownfield funding budget risks reputational damage in Whitehall to add to the damage done by its near-breach of the Prudential Code and the failure of the company itself.</p><div class="breakoutbox"><p class="caption"><img src="cathedral-and-quay-car-park.avif" alt="Cathedral and Quay car park" width="800" height="450"> Cathedral and Quay car park</p><ul><li>Site owned by Exeter City Council, car park has “structural issues”</li><li><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s91814/Appendix%20A%20-%20ECL.pdf">31 flats for private market sale built on top of multi-storey car park</a></li><li>Scheme likely to obstruct views of the cathedral</li><li>Brownfield Land Release Fund award £2,373,183 of which £22,048 spent</li><li>Brownfield funding criteria not met, 31 March 2024 land sale/works start deadline</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="exeter-city-living-2022-23-business-plan-redacted-via-freedom-of-information-request.pdf">2022-23 business plan</a>: works to start June 2024</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s91815/Appendix%20B%20-%20ECL.pdf">activities and achievements summary</a>: not being progressed</li></ul></div><p>As the independent reviewers say, “generating profit in house building is a complex challenge which relies on rigorous cost control (at the level of individual components and packages of works) and a mature sub-contractor supply chain.</p><p>“Well-established house builders protect their profit margin by micro-managing [various important] aspects of the development process.</p><p>“We have found elsewhere that other councils have underestimated the challenges of generating cross-subsidy profit and that it is not always possible for councils to exert the same levels of efficiency using the building contractor tender route.”</p><p>They add that “the barriers for delivery of the remaining pipeline, such as it is, appear at best very high, and quite possibly insurmountable”, and that “there remain multiple high probability and high impact risks, which will be difficult for either Exeter City Council or Exeter City Living to manage”.</p><div class="breakoutbox"><p class="caption"><img src="bonhay-meadows-development-site.avif" alt="Bonhay Meadows development site" width="800" height="450"> Bonhay Meadows development site</p><ul><li>Site owned by Exeter City Council, underground flood water tanks</li><li>92 flats in two tower blocks</li><li>Brownfield Land Release Fund award £1,009,870 of which £6,015 spent</li><li>Brownfield funding criteria not met, 31 March 2024 land sale/works start deadline</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="exeter-city-living-2022-23-business-plan-redacted-via-freedom-of-information-request.pdf">2022-23 business plan</a>: works to start summer 2023</li><li>Exeter City Living <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s91815/Appendix%20B%20-%20ECL.pdf">activities and achievements summary</a>: not being progressed</li></ul></div><p>All these viability challenges are as significant now as they were when Exeter City Living was incorporated, notwithstanding company mismanagement, before the HRA cap was lifted and before Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine or interest rate rises began.</p><p>What might they mean for the council’s <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/liveable-exeter/">Liveable Exeter</a> brownfield site development “vision”?</p><p>Several of the sites the company failed to bring forward are allocated in the new <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/exeter-local-plan/">Exeter Local Plan</a>, which echoes its business plan language around “demonstrating viable delivery of ‘net zero’ housing on brownfield sites”.</p><p>Exeter City Living enjoys numerous advantages as a development company. It is owned by a council which is happy to finance both its production and sales with long-term publicly-financed loans at fixed interest rates while backing its bids to government for multi-million pound enabling grants. The council, as local planning authority, is willing to override its own affordable housing policy to help the company deliver. And the council, as landowner, is prepared to sell it sites for half their market value without the company having to go to tender.</p><p>What form would development have to take on these sites to make them viable if a company with all Exeter City Living’s advantages can’t deliver them?

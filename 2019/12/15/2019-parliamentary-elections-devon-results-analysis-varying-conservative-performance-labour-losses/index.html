increased most of all in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Devon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)">Devon North</a>, the only constituency in the county to coincide with its namesake district, despite the Conservatives losing control of the council in May to the Liberal Democrats.</p><p>Newcomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selaine_Saxby">Selaine Saxby</a>, who was elected as a district councillor in May, saw the Conservative vote share rise by nearly 11% to boost the party’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000838">majority to 15,000</a> on an unchanged 73% turnout.</p><p>The Liberal Democrats have historically performed well in this seat: it was held for their Liberal predecessors by party leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Thorpe">Jeremy Thorpe</a> from 1959 to 1979 and again by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Harvey">Nick Harvey</a> from 1992 to 2015, so the loss of 8% of the vote share and the scale of the Conservative victory is all the more remarkable.</p><p>Selaine Saxby is the first female MP to represent the constituency and one of only two women representing the county in Parliament. 220 female MPs have been elected, 12 more than the previous peak in 2017, but they still only constitute just over a third of the House of Commons.</p><p><img

height="836"></p><p>Meanwhile <a href="https://twitter.com/electoralreform/status/1205435581402099713">Electoral Reform Society analysis</a> of results across the country has revealed that while the 865,000 people who voted for the Green Party will be represented by a single MP, each of the SNP’s 48 Westminster MPs only needed 26,000 votes to take a seat in Parliament.</p><p>At the same time 45.3% of votes were cast for losing candidates, so none of those votes will be represented in Parliament at all.</p></article><hr class="divider"><aside class="prompt"><p><span>Exeter Observer is a

They voted on a range of reasons to refuse the application from offshore-registered PBSA Heavitree Road S.A.R.L. and the office of the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner.</p><p>These included the adverse impact of the proposed development’s scale, mass and siting, the insufficient residential amenity space it provided, the harm it would do to the surrounding area and its residents and the loss of 26 trees on the site. They then sent Mr Collinson away to support their objections with relevant planning policies.</p><p>He duly returned to the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=116&amp;MId=6771">following committee meeting</a> a fortnight ago with “full technical reasons for refusal”, carefully crafted by planning officers to present the strongest possible case for the council’s decision in the face of an expected appeal challenge.</p><p>However Mr Collinson also said that the applicants, having already asked to defer the decision from the committee’s July to September meeting, now wanted to defer it again, this time from October to <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=116&amp;MId=7066">December</a>, which will be the sixth time council planning committee members have convened to consider their proposals.</p><p>He <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s86301/21-1564-OUT%20-%20Committee%20Report%20Final.pdf">recommended the deferral</a> to allow an eighth design revision followed by a fourth review panel assessment and yet another round of public consultation, and “to ensure that any proposals considered at appeal are the most appropriate for the area”. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3-QAwza3b0">the meeting</a> he said: “All the applicant has asked for is a bit more time”.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img data-src="aerial-view-south-west-800px.png" alt="Illustrative aerial view from south west" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> <a href="aerial-view-south-west.png" data-alt="Illustrative aerial view from south west" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Illustrative aerial view from south west.

Now another of each must take place too.</p><p>Meanwhile none of the 115 comments made by members of the public who have managed to participate in the planning process despite the impediments created by the applicants’ approach are in favour.</p><p>The developers have so far submitted 130 application documents, 51 of which have been superseded at one stage or another, and generated dozens of correspondence threads, many of which have to be revisited each time the proposals are further revised.</p><p>Despite all this the plans for the site remain essentially unaltered since their submission.</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><h3>Heavitree Road development timeline</h3><table class="uk-table uk-table-divider uk-table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Event</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>July 2020</td><td>Initial concept design proposed and discussed with council officers</td><td>Design iteration I</td></tr><tr><td>November 2020</td><td>Pre-application design statement presented</td><td>Design iteration II</td></tr><tr><td>December 2020</td><td>Design Review Panel I</td><td>Raised concerns about scale/mass etc.</td></tr><tr><td>February 2021</td><td>Council Planning Member Working Group meeting I</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Design Review Panel II</td><td>Design iteration III</td></tr><tr><td>July 2021</td><td>"Significantly revised proposals"</td><td>Design iteration IV</td></tr><tr><td>August 2021</td><td>Design Review Panel III</td><td>"Welcomed the design and felt that the mass was appropriate"</td></tr><tr><td>September 2021</td><td>Council Planning Member Working Group meeting II</td><td>"Issues previously highlighted and still considered relevant to revised proposals ..."</td></tr><tr><td>October 2021</td><td>Developer submits design iteration IV as formal planning application</td><td>Public consultation round I triggered</td></tr><tr><td>January 2022</td><td>Developer submits revised plans/additional info</td><td>Design iteration V triggers public consultation round II</td></tr><tr><td>June 2022</td><td>Developer submits revised plans/additional info</td><td>Design iteration VI triggers public consultation round III</td></tr><tr><td>July 2022</td><td>Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=116&amp;MId=6769">planning committee I</a> inc. initial <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s85257/21-1564-FUL%20-%20Committee%20Report%20Final.pdf">officer report</a></td><td>Officers recommend approval, meeting deferred at developer's request</td></tr><tr><td>August 2022</td><td>Developer submits revised plans/additional info</td><td>Design iteration VII: only Health &amp;

He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPgutSxKjFs">described</a> the proposed buildings as “a blot on the landscape” with a “blandly modern, suffocating frontage [that] will dominate and jar badly with the historic and much admired architecture and aesthetics of the St Luke’s campus opposite”.</p><p>Labour’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1770">Emma Morse</a> said the design was not taking the surrounding area into account while Labour’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1882">Bob Foale</a> called it a “carbuncle” and Labour’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=9757">Marina Asvachin</a> said it was “hideous”.</p><p>Undaunted, Ian Collinson <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s85790/21-1564-OUT%20-%20Planning%20Committee%20Presentation%20-%20Heavitree%20Road%20-%20ICFinal.pdf">presented the design</a> as “strong and bold architecture, appropriate for an ambitious and confident city like Exeter” which would “repair some of the urban fabric along a key gateway to the city centre”.</p><p>He added adding that bringing the site frontage forward to “address Heavitree Road” would improve on the current development footprint, which he said makes “no contribution to the street scene”.</p><p>Liberal Democrat <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5827">Michael Mitchell</a> also disagreed. He said the design revisions hadn’t improved the visual impact at all and that the proximity of the proposed frontage to the pavement would destroy the good example of adjacent buildings which are set back from the road.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img data-src="ground-floor-plan-800px.png" alt="Illustrative ground floor plan" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> <a href="ground-floor-plan.png" data-alt="Illustrative ground floor plan" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Illustrative ground floor plan.

Anne Jobson added that, as the developers confirmed last year, the proposed studios are “not suitable for families or couples with small children”.</p><p>The <a href="https://nixonproperty.com/">prospective Heavitree Road co-living block operator</a> doesn’t even intend to offer security of tenure or exclusive occupation rights to residents. The licenses to occupy <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/K28kdgc6DslK3q54Dtz7z/2/757921/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">it intends to issue instead of tenancy agreements</a> confer neither, while allowing it to enter at any time without notice and to summarily evict with just two weeks’ warning.</p><p>Unlike tenancy agreements, such licenses allow residents no recourse to the courts to challenge eviction. When the developer refused to agree to the minimum three month tenancies proposed by council officers in pre-application discussion it said issuing tenancy agreements would “impact on the flexibility needed to ensure the viability of the proposals”.</p><p>Council leader <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=885">Phil Bialyk</a> nevertheless said he thinks the co-living concept is a “good principle”. Council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgExecPostDetails.aspx?ID=618">development portfolio holder</a> Emma Morse added: “I actually don’t mind co-living”, referring to a holiday in The Netherlands during which she “looked at the tiny homes principles” and found herself thinking that “there is actually a conversation to be had with co-living”.</p><p>Both sit on the planning committee despite <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/publications/probity-planning-advice-councillors-and-officers-making-planning-decisions">Local Government Association guidance</a> which explicitly advises against the council leader and portfolio holder doing so. Neither said whether they intend to move from their hilltop houses, which have large gardens, are surrounded by fields and trees and are together the size of fifteen of the proposed Heavitree Road studios to explore these principles in practice.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="heavitree-road-elevation-facing-st-lukes-proposed.png" alt="Illustrative proposed Heavitree Road elevation facing St Luke's" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Illustrative proposed Heavitree Road elevation facing St Luke’s.

Unfortunately there is <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/12/15/pennsylvania-petitioners-expose-fifteen-years-of-flawed-exeter-city-council-student-accommodation-policy-making/">no evidence to support the claim that the number of HMOs in the city has fallen as these blocks have been built</a>, as Michael Mitchell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPgutSxKjFs">said</a>.</p><p>This is essentially because the university has expanded so rapidly that the number of students living here during term-time, which has tripled over the past fifteen years, has massively outpaced the rate of development delivery.</p><p>According to information obtained from the university under freedom of information legislation, there were 39,000 students based at its Exeter campuses during the 2012-22 academic year. That’s just under 30% of the city’s <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/populationandhouseholdestimatesenglandandwales/census2021">130,800 inhabitants</a>.</p><p>The council’s own consultants recently confirmed that <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/03/29/council-consultants-confirm-58-percent-of-exeter-university-students-live-in-city-residential-housing-stock/">58% of Exeter’s university students live in residential housing stock</a>.

That the <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/09/26/new-exeter-local-plan-outline-draft-consultation/">draft of the new Exeter local plan</a>, for which Mr Collinson is responsible, has nothing to say about this issue, and doesn’t even mention co-living, strongly suggests that the council has no intention of intervening to constrain it.</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="university-of-exeter-students-by-campus-base-2021-22">University of Exeter students by campus base 2021-22</h3><table class="uk-table uk-table-divider uk-table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Students</th><th>Streatham</th><th>St Luke's</th><th>Penryn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Full-time undergraduate</td><td>20,415</td><td>2,989</td><td>2,339</td></tr><tr><td>Full-time postgraduate</td><td>8,238</td><td>1,509</td><td>1,001</td></tr><tr><td>Part-time undergraduate</td><td>834</td><td>25</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>Part-time postgraduate</td><td>3,251</td><td>1,180</td><td>129</td></tr><tr><td>Semester undergraduate</td><td>259</td><td>4</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Semester postgraduate</td><td>31</td><td>65</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Full-time postgraduate single term</td><td>13</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Full-time postgraduate distance learning</td><td>9</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part-time undergraduate distance learning</td><td>48</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Part-time postgraduate distance learning</td><td>34</td><td>545</td><td></td></tr><thead><tr><th>Totals</th><th>33,132</th><th>6,317</th><th>3,542</th></tr></thead></tbody></table><p>Source: University of Exeter under freedom of information legislation</p></aside><p class="uk-dropcap">Considering the raft of issues raised by councillors and the public around the Heavitree Road proposals, and the insubstantial revisions that have been made to them since they were submitted, it does not seem likely that an eighth round of amendments will address all the reasons to refuse them identified by councillors in September and clarified a fortnight ago.</p><p>Many local authorities have formal policies which restrict the scope of developers to amend planning applications once they have been submitted. Cornwall Council, for example, <a href="https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-advice-and-guidance/revisions-and-amendments-to-planning-applications/">prohibits any changes that would trigger new public consultations</a> on existing proposals.</p><p>While Exeter City Council does not have such a policy, Ian Collinson did say, when asked, that “there are limits to what an applicant can do to change an application while it’s being considered”, adding that the proposals eighth iteration “would broadly be the same application, in terms of the mix of uses, with broadly the [same] number of homes”.</p><p>He also said, and Emma Morse confirmed, that should the committee refuse the revised application at its December meeting it would do so on the same basis as before. Neither explained how the same reasons for refusal that had applied in September could be reapplied to proposals to which the applicant’s representative insisted there would be “significant changes”.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="trees-beside-former-magistrates-court.jpg" alt="Trees beside the former magistrates' court" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Trees beside the former magistrates’ court</p><p>Several councillors expressed scepticism. Matt Vizard said: “Any revised application needs to address all the reasons that were cited for refusal, and comprehensively so”, saying his concern was that there may be a “fundamental problem with this application”.</p><p>Labour’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=119">Rob Hannaford</a> asked how realistic it was to expect that the applicants could address the committee’s concerns given the likely impact on scheme viability. Michael Mitchell said he hoped they would make major changes as “the existing application is totally unsuitable for the site”. The Green Party’s Diana Moore expressed doubt that the changes would be significant.</p><p>Anne Jobson said that whatever happened, the committee would still be “dealing with buildings that we decided on the last occasion were just not appropriate for this particular site”, adding that it was clear why the committee had opposed the design and that Neil Howells had failed to give her “any assurance that this is going to be a substantially different scheme” that would “meet the needs of residents of Exeter, particularly key workers and those who need homes”.</p><p>Emma Morse sought to reassure committee members that they could still refuse the application. But she did not point out that every change to the proposals, however minor, that moves them closer to policy compliance increases the risk of a refusal being overturned at appeal.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="higher-summerlands-adjacent-residential-housing.jpg" alt="Development site boundary beside Higher Summerlands residential housing" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Development site boundary beside Higher Summerlands residential housing</p><p>We might also wonder whether Ian Collinson is on a collision course with councillors over the Liveable Exeter property development scheme after expressing such strong support for the Heavitree Road proposals. As <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/10/13/haven-banks-redevelopment-flood-risk-environment-agency-liveable-exeter-build-to-rent-co-living-housing-density-amenity/">at Haven Banks</a>, the applicants are clearly convinced that the design they submitted last July is aligned with the “ambitions of the Liveable Exeter agenda”, not least because council officers have told them as much.</p><p>Matt Vizard was, however, in no doubt that the Heavitree Road scheme doesn’t meet the Liveable Exeter “vision”. So exercised was he on behalf of what he described as “the long standing residents of modest, mixed housing on Higher Summerlands and St Matthew’s Court” who he said “would be faced with a looming block just a few metres away” that “would dominate their landscape” that he said the proposals should be refused “to restore their faith in the planning process”.</p><p>Anne Jobson added that the scheme wouldn’t deliver on Exeter’s ostensible garden city aspirations. Revealingly, Ian Collinson responded by saying that the Liveable Exeter garden city “principles” cover lots of issues, suggesting they are sufficiently flexible to mean whatever their authors want.</p><p>Perhaps this is the basis on which Neil Howells said that “the proposals are consistent with the new Exeter local plan”? This frames the “<a href="https://exeterobserver.org/documents/exeter-city-council-outline-draft-local-plan-for-consultation-september-2022-liveable-exeter-principles-policy-s2.pdf">Liveable Exeter delivery principles</a>” in terms so vague that property developers presumably expect them not to get in their way.</p><p>Certainly, with the scheme barely begun, developers are coming forward under the Liveable Exeter banner with plans for hundreds of unaffordable sub-standard bedsits with inadequate amenity space that deny their occupants tenancy rights at densities among the highest in the world which won’t address Exeter’s housing crisis and hardly anyone could call a home.</p><aside class="box join"><h5>Independent, investigative, in the public interest</h5><p>Exeter Observer is published by a member-owned, co-operative <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/about/exeter-observer-limited/">community benefit society</a>.</p><p>It is our members that enable us to hold wealth, power and the influence of individuals and institutions to account by investigating their actions and challenging them in the public sphere.</p><div class="uk-text-right"><a href="/join/" class="uk-badge">Join Exeter Observer<span uk-icon="icon: arrow-right; ratio: 1.5"></span></a></div></aside><p>All the more reason, then, to ask why so many members of the planning committee changed their minds between its September and October meetings.</p><p>Apart from Anne Jobson, Diana Moore and the Green Party’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=9735">Carol Bennett</a>, who have consistently opposed the proposals, and Labour’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=6676">Zion Lights</a>, who has spoken enthusiastically in their favour, all the other committee members moved from being minded to refuse (or abstain) to voting to give the applicants another chance.</p><p>Many observers thought Labour committee members intended to refuse the application in September on the basis that the developer was certain to appeal, while counting on the appeal hearing not taking place until after next May’s local elections. (The party would like to win back the Heavitree seat it lost to Carol Bennett last year and the Newtown &amp; St Leonard’s seat it lost to Jemima Moore in 2019.)</p><p>The thinking was that while approving an unpopular, high-profile development at the heart of one ward and en route for the other would greatly increase the chances of their political opponents prevailing in both, postponing the outcome to appeal would mitigate this risk.</p><p>Indeed, five days after the September meeting, Matt Vizard told a Newtown Community Association meeting that while he hoped the applicants would further discuss their proposals with the council he thought it more likely they would go straight to appeal.</p><p>Others reckon that the subsequent deferral is intended to reduce the risk of another major council loss at appeal following significant decisions against it at <a href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?CaseID=3292721&amp;CoID=0">Spruce Close</a> and <a href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?CaseID=3278148&amp;CoID=0">Redhills</a>. (Since the committee’s October meeting the council has also lost significant appeals at the <a href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?CaseID=3300322&amp;CoID=0">former Exeter Royal Academy for Deaf Education site</a> and <a href="https://acp.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/ViewCase.aspx?CaseID=3296946&amp;CoID=0">Clyst Road</a>.)</p><p>However, while the cost of fighting such appeals is a consideration, these decisions do not put the council at risk of falling foul of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-planning-performance-criteria-for-designation/improving-planning-performance-criteria-for-designation-updated-2022">government’s criteria for assessing local planning authority performance</a>.</p><p>So the question appears to be, however significant or otherwise the changes made during the current iteration of the Heavitree Road redevelopment proposals, whether it would be worse to refuse then lose at appeal after next year’s local elections or to approve an unpopular decision just before Christmas in the hope everybody will be looking the other way.</p></article><hr class="uk-divider-icon"><p class="contributor"><a rel="author" href="https://exeterobserver.org/contributors/martin-redfern">Martin Redfern</a>&nbsp;is editor of Exeter Observer and a director of its publisher Exeter Observer Limited.</p><p class="contributor"><a rel="author" href="https://exeterobserver.org/contributors/leigh-curtis">Leigh Curtis</a>&nbsp;is membership co-ordinator and community &amp;

But it does not account for the emissions that will result from the additional 12,000 homes that the council wants to build which will increase Exeter’s population by around 22% over the next twenty years.</p><p>Nor does it account for emissions that are imported by Exeter’s residents, businesses and visitors which are likely to be much higher than its territorial emissions.</p><p>This omission is not the result of ignorance: the council also commissioned a greenhouse gas emissions inventory from the same University of Exeter team to use in its own corporate carbon reporting which includes the emissions that were excluded from the city-wide inventory.</p><p><a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/council_carbon_reduction_strateg_41">More than two-thirds of the city council’s corporate emissions</a> occur under this emissions scope.</p><iframe width="800" height="1115" src="/documents/university-of-exeter-centre-for-energy-and-the-environment-exeter-greenhouse-gas-inventory-february-2022.pdf" uk-responsive=""></iframe><p class="uk-dropcap">There are several approaches to greenhouse gas emissions accounting in use. Each yields different estimates using different methodologies based on different data sets. Efforts to improve their accuracy are ongoing.</p><p>The <a href="https://climate-change.data.gov.uk/articles/measuring-greenhouse-gas-emissions">UK government uses three principal official measures</a> to fulfil a range of international agreements and for domestic policy-making purposes.</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-territorial-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics">BEIS territorial estimates</a> include emissions produced within the UK’s borders while <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsatmosphericemissionsgreenhousegasemissionsbyeconomicsectorandgasunitedkingdom">ONS residence estimates</a> cover emissions by UK residents and UK-registered businesses whether in the UK or overseas. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint">DEFRA carbon footprint estimates</a> account for the emissions of all goods and services consumed in the UK wherever they are produced in the world.</p><p>A comprehensive (and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-global/">globally just</a>) approach to calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of a given population or geography requires the use of a methodology which accounts not only for emissions produced within that territory but also emissions that are imported, as well as exported.</p><p>The DEFRA carbon footprint estimates follow this approach. They account for emissions in the places where goods and services are consumed, rather than the (usually many) places that respond to that demand by supplying the goods or services in which emissions are embedded.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/10598258"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>As a result DEFRA carbon footprint estimates yield much higher figures for the emissions for which the UK is responsible than the BEIS territorial estimates, which produce the lowest.</p><p>In 2016 the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/netzeroandthedifferentofficialmeasuresoftheuksgreenhousegasemissions/2019-07-24#other-official-measures-of-the-uks-greenhouse-gas-emissions">ONS estimated</a> that 40% of the UK’s carbon footprint related to imported emissions while <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint">DEFRA found</a> the proportion was 43% in 2019 and has since revised this upwards to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint/carbon-footprint-for-the-uk-and-england-to-2019">nearly 48% in its most recent estimates</a>, the methodology for which it now considers fully developed.</p><p>As the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint/carbon-footprint-for-the-uk-and-england-to-2019">DEFRA carbon footprint estimates</a> are calculated for the whole country it is only possible to use them for smaller geographies on a broad per capita basis. Doing so yields an annual carbon footprint for Exeter of around 1.5 million tCO2e in 2019, the most recent year for which these figures are available.</p><p>(To ensure they are reported on a consistent basis, greenhouse gas emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent - tCO2e - where each of the seven main greenhouse gases are weighted by their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential">global warming potential</a>.)</p><p>This is about equal to the figure of <a href="https://twitter.com/ExeCityFutures/status/1385594505571835906">11.6 tCO2e per person per annum for Exeter</a> that Exeter City Futures <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/11/04/greens-call-for-evidence-based-exeter-carbon-budget-as-city-council-clings-to-net-zero-rhetoric/">promoted last year</a> (and well over <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/07/21/net-zero-exeter-2030-plan-part-one-exeters-carbon-footprint-exeter-city-futures-exeter-city-council-fridays-for-future-climate-activists/">a million tonnes a year more than the total of all projected carbon savings</a> from the actions proposed by the company’s <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/net-zero-exeter/">Net Zero Exeter</a> plan).</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/10598454"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>Calculating Exeter’s emissions using the 2019 BEIS territorial emissions estimates on the same broad per capita basis as the DEFRA figures yields a much lower annual carbon footprint for the city of around 900,000 tCO2e.</p><p>However the distribution of territorial emissions around the UK differs widely. Small cities with low levels of carbon-intensive industrial and goods production activity, such as Exeter, are responsible for a much lower proportion of UK terrestrial emissions per capita than cities such as Swansea or Coventry which produce steel and cars for domestic use as well as export.</p><p>Wealthy cities also typically import a higher proportion of their emissions than poorer cities because their residents have greater disposable incomes with which to buy goods and services that are typically produced elsewhere.</p><p>As a result Exeter’s terrestrial emissions will be lower than the BEIS per capita UK average, while the proportion of its imported consumption emissions will be higher than the DEFRA per capita UK average.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/10598883"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>How much lower? After updating its methodology this year to include <a href="https://theconversation.com/methane-emissions-reach-new-highs-despite-pandemic-they-are-four-times-more-sensitive-to-climate-change-than-first-thought-185925">methane</a> and nitrous oxide (but not fluorinated gases) in its local authority estimates BEIS said <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-local-authority-and-regional-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics-2005-to-2020">Exeter’s territorial greenhouse gas emissions were 488,000 tCO2e in 2019</a>. Fluorinated gases would add around 29,000 tCO2e to make a total of around 517,000 tCO2e.</p><p>How much higher? The DEFRA estimates for 2019 found that nearly 81% of the UK’s consumption emissions were accounted for by goods and services produced both in the UK and abroad.</p><p>Unfortunately, calculating an accurate consumption-based carbon footprint for a sub-national geography such as Exeter using the approach which produced the DEFRA figures is not possible as it relies on national trade data, expressed in financial terms, to link flows of goods and services with the emissions generated by their production and distribution.</p><p>So while we can be sure that Exeter produces some of the goods and services it consumes, we cannot be sure how much. As a result we can only use the DEFRA estimates to conclude that the proportion of the city’s consumption-driven greenhouse gas emissions which it imports in the form of goods and services could be as much as three quarters or more of the total.</p><p>Nor are the BEIS terrestrial estimates directly comparable with the DEFRA consumption estimates. Exeter’s imported emissions cannot simply be added to its terrestrial emissions as this would not address emissions from the production of goods and services in the city that are exported for consumption elsewhere, among other issues.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand;

These BEIS estimates only accounted for carbon dioxide emissions, so the university team used these as a basis on which to estimate other greenhouse gas emissions for that year.</p><p>As the BEIS estimates entirely omit some sectors and gases the university also used other data as well as proxy sources to fill in some of the other gaps.</p><p>Like the BEIS territorial emissions estimates on which they are based, SWEEG methodology estimates only cover greenhouse gas emissions in scopes one and two.</p><p>(It is unclear whether the city council chief executive understands this: when asked by Green Party councillor <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=9764">Tess Read</a> to clarify which emissions scopes were included in the Exeter inventory, <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s85007/Cllr%20Read%20Q%20and%20A%20Final.pdf">he incorrectly replied</a> that it only covered scope one).</p><p>The city council claims this is because such emissions are “more in the control of people living, working and visiting the city”.

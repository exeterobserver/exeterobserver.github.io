We made promises to you and we are delivering on those promises.”</p><p>2022 Exeter Labour local elections campaign leaflet</p></blockquote><p>A party that has been in power as long as Labour has in Exeter should not only expect to be the subject of enhanced scrutiny, it should be sufficiently resilient to welcome criticism and prepared to make its case in turn.</p><p>When we asked it to respond to a series of questions about its campaign materials, however, it took more than a week to reply, and still didn’t provide any answers. We expected the party to have the sources on which its claims are based to hand, but it seems it does not.</p><p>As we cannot address all of Labour’s many statements we’ve included its 2022-23 manifesto in full to enable you to assess its position in detail. We’ve refrained from looking at campaign materials from before 2016, by when it had already been the largest party on the council for five years.</p><p>We also haven’t scrutinised Exeter’s other political parties in the same way. Not only have they not been making the decisions for the past ten years, their policy proposals and attempts at intervention are <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/02/22/decision-to-send-council-ceo-and-director-to-work-for-exeter-city-futures-is-disservice-to-citizens/">routinely rejected or ignored</a>.

Council leader Phil Bialyk also made this claim during his <a href="https://express.adobe.com/page/tUyA64emEq7z9/">2022-23 budget speech</a>, when he said it had been derived from the Centre for Cities.</p><p>Centre for Cities housing stock data is out of date: the most recent year it covers is 2019-20. During that year it shows <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/data-tool/su/f8a07449">Exeter in 28th place</a> for actual housing stock increase. It is only when this change is viewed as a percentage increase per head of population that Exeter comes out on top, but this is partly a function of the city being amongst the smallest places included in the 63 cities and towns that the Centre for Cities covers.</p><p>In fact Exeter only just squeaks over the Centre for Cities’ minimum population threshold of 135,000 on the basis of its large daytime commuter influx. Exeter’s residential population remains below this level.</p><p class="caption"><img src="centre-for-cities-data-tool-exeter-estimated-population-2020.png" alt="Centre for Cities data tool showing Exeter estimated population 2020" width="800" height="842"> Exeter estimated population 2020. Source: <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/data-tool/su/ea987228">Centre for Cities</a>.</p><p>Both Exeter Labour and the council have a habit of <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/03/26/selective-use-of-statistics-presents-unbalanced-account-of-exeter-economic-and-environmental-status-city-council-chief-executive-centre-for-cities/">selectively quoting Centre for Cities statistics</a> without considering methodological issues relating to Exeter’s <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/business/relocating-to-exeter/exeter-economy-in-numbers/">exceptionally large travel to work area</a> which distorts them — issues which Centre for Cities itself recognises.</p><p>Exeter was only included in Centre for Cities reporting when its <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/the-changing-geography-of-the-uk-economy/">methodology was changed</a> to reduce its previous emphasis on travel to work areas.</p><p>However there is a much more significant issue with these figures, which the Centre for Cities does not factor in: summary housing stock completion data includes Purpose Built Student Accommodation.</p><p>Of the 1,137 housing units completed in Exeter in 2019-20, the year to which Labour’s claim refers, more than half were student accommodation bedspaces according to <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5861/amr-2020-2021.pdf">the council’s own monitoring report</a>. In 2020-21 non-student housing completions fell to just 348, over 200 fewer than in 2019-20.</p><p>In normative fact-checking terminology this manifesto claim is therefore mostly false: it may contain a kernel of truth but leaves out facts which would produce a different conclusion.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9404651"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 election manifesto goes on to say that this housing stock claim is “reflected in the council exceeding the housing delivery test with a score of 155%”, which it also lists among its key achievements and which council leader Phil Bialyk also included in his 2022-23 budget speech.</p><p>However this figure again depends on the inclusion of Purpose Built Student Accommodation in Exeter’s housing delivery totals, despite a <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5766/210928-5yls-statement-web-version-2.pdf">2015 High Court judgement</a> which ruled that Purpose Built Student Accommodation could only be included in local authority five year land supplies if there was evidence that its construction resulted in the release of existing residential housing stock from student occupation.</p><p>The council claimed in its September 2021 <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5766/210928-5yls-statement-web-version-2.pdf">five year housing land supply statement</a> that Exeter could include student accommodation in its delivery totals as the government had introduced a new housing delivery test methodology in 2018 and new guidance in 2019.</p><p>The guidance said that Purpose Built Student Accommodation could be counted as part of the housing supply to the extent it released existing residential housing stock from student occupation, or allowed such stock to remain in general use.</p><p>But there is no evidence that residential housing stock is either being retained for or returned to general use in Exeter, as the university’s inexorable expansion <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/03/29/council-consultants-confirm-58-percent-of-exeter-university-students-live-in-city-residential-housing-stock/">continues to outpace</a> the construction of new student accommodation blocks.</p><p>Without including Purpose Built Student Accommodation Exeter’s housing delivery test score for 2020-21 would be 93%, making this manifesto claim also mostly false.</p><p>This was reflected in a test of the council’s five year housing land supply statement as part of a January <a href="https://publicaccess.exeter.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=QADK88HBHNH00">planning appeal</a>.

If it has another year of growth like this one another 500 dwellings will be lost from Exeter’s residential housing stock and the number of student <a href="https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation">HMOs</a> will overtake the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/local-authority-housing-statistics-data-returns-for-2020-to-2021">number of council houses</a> in the city.</p><p>This means that university expansion alone is enough to offset most, if not all, of the housing stock increases resulting from new development. The council’s <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/search?query=liveable+exeter">relentless</a> promotion of the city to incomers and visitors via its <a href="exeter-live-better-brand-summary.pdf">parody-proof</a> “<a href="https://www.liveableexeter.co.uk/about">Liveable Exeter</a>” and “<a href="https://www.exeterlivebetter.com/live">Exeter Live Better</a>” marketing brands is an additional demand driver.</p><p class="caption"><img src="exeter-city-council-liveable-exeter-promotional-map.png" alt="Exeter City Council Liveable Exeter promotional map" width="800" height="450"> Liveable Exeter promotional map.

It repeated the same pledges during its 2019 campaign in leaflets and its manifesto.</p><p>Its 2020 manifesto (for elections which were postponed because of the pandemic) repeated the council land policy promise, and the party subsequently confirmed that it had introduced this policy, but Labour councillors nevertheless approved the <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/12/03/harlequins-shopping-centre-redevelopment-substandard-coliving-hotel-student-accommodation-liveable-exeter-city-council-conservation-charities-community-campaign-harm-historic-heritage-assets/">redevelopment of Harlequins shopping centre</a> for “co-living”, described as student accommodation “in all but name”, in December.

Ten houses have been built at Bovemoors Lane and nine at Thornpark Rise, but all were completed by January 2021.</p><p>In his 2022-23 budget speech, council leader Phil Bialyk said: “Work has commenced on 21 new Passivhaus flats at Hamlin Gardens” but the site remains in use as a car park.</p><p class="caption"><img src="hamlin-gardens-exeter-city-living-development-site.jpg" alt="Hamlin Gardens Exeter City Living development site" width="800" height="450"> Hamlin Gardens development site: the council approved a budget of £4 million for a four storey block of 21 flats here in October 2019, with Exeter City Living as its development agent, but had to increase the budget by £1.3 million last month in response to rising costs. Work has yet to begin.</p><p><a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/exeter-city-living/">Exeter City Living</a>, the council’s wholly-owned development company, is <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/03/31/why-does-exeter-city-council-evade-public-scrutiny-of-exeter-city-living-property-development-decisions/">responsible for all these projects</a>.</p><p>The council has so far allocated nearly £1 million to the company for start up and planning costs, loaned it nearly £25 million for development delivery, gifted it more than £2 million in land purchase discounts and commissioned or purchased just over £20 million of housing.</p><p>The company has also been granted more than £7 million of central government financial support, yet it has so far completed a total of just 22 units, all of which are council houses, and it has taken five years for the council to get this far.</p><p>Exeter Labour’s 2022 election campaign leaflets say it has “continued its commitment to deliver over 500 council homes in the next five years”. Yet its current delivery rates mean it is losing council housing (via <a href="https://www.gov.uk/right-to-buy-buying-your-council-home">right to buy</a> sales and other routes) faster than it is building replacements. There appears to be little chance it can fulfil this pledge.</p><p class="caption"><img src="edwards-court-exeter-city-council-extra-care-housing-scheme.jpg" alt="Edwards Court extra care housing scheme" width="800" height="450"> Edwards Court care housing scheme: the council spent £6 million on this development, which Labour lists as a key achievement in its 2022-23 manifesto. However <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=49880&amp;Opt=3&amp;AIID=54025">it was compelled</a> to take responsibility for facilities management when its plan to commission a care provider fell through because of “market changes” and the building is still empty six months after completion.</p><p>Despite the net loss of council housing Exeter Labour’s 2022-23 manifesto says it is “proud of being a council which has maintained and developed our number of social housing homes”. It also says it “insists on affordable housing as part of any new commercial housing developments”.</p><p>When <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=43707">Exeter City Living was created in July 2018</a> the late Pete Edwards, then council leader, was adamant that it would always satisfy the council’s policy that 35% of all developments over ten houses would be affordable.</p><p>This did not prevent the council <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/10/07/exeter-city-council-plans-to-scrap-affordable-housing-requirement-for-clifton-hill-sports-centre-site-redevelopment/">scrapping the planning agreement</a> that bound the company to include eleven affordable flats in the Clifton Hill sports centre redevelopment, which would only have been 26% of its 42 homes in any case. Some of these houses are expected to go on sale for more than £800,000 when they are finally completed.</p><p class="caption"><img src="clifton-hill-sports-centre-exeter-city-living-development-site.jpg" alt="Clifton Hill sport centre Exeter City Living development site" width="800" height="450"> Clifton Hill sport centre development site: Exeter City Living intends to construct 42 housing units here, some for sale for more than £800,000, but the centre closed four years ago and redevelopment work is still not expected to begin for several more months.</p><p>Even the party’s own campaign materials confirm that it has not delivered its own affordable housing policy. Its 2019 manifesto said that 19.5% of the homes completed in Exeter since 2013 were affordable, then its 2020 manifesto said this figure had risen to 20.9%.</p><p>However these claims are false. Even if we allow the council’s argument that Purpose Built Student Accommodation should be included in Exeter’s housing delivery totals, only 11% of the units completed between 2013 and 2019 were affordable (including council housing). The true figure for 2013 to 2020 was 10.1%.</p><p>And when Purpose Built Student Accommodation is excluded from the figures, which would help Exeter Labour’s case, the proportion of affordable housing delivered in Exeter between 2013 and 2021 was just 15.7%. Over the past three years this has fallen to 12.6%.</p><p>Labour didn’t make any claims about its affordable housing delivery rates in last year’s manifesto, and it hasn’t in this year’s either.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9404769"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>These low affordable delivery rates have been compounded by the developing disconnect between the local economy, dominated by large public sector and poorly-paid tertiary service workers, and the spending power of those driving Exeter housing demand: university students (or their parents) and incomers from other parts of the country.</p><p>Both renting and purchasing have become extremely unaffordable for Exeter residents: the council admitted as much last month when <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=54469">it acknowledged</a> that “house prices have risen by 18% since December 2016”.</p><p>It also acknowledged the impact this was having on the local economy in turn: “People are declining job offers as they are unable to find rental properties within or near the city”.</p><p>As housing is considered to be “affordable” when it costs 80% of local market prices, without considering local wages, the more unaffordable a place becomes the more the gap between earnings and costs widens in real terms.</p><p>Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that Exeter Labour demurs from quoting the Centre for Cities on this issue: it says Exeter is now the <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/data-tool/su/7e2878b4">seventh most unaffordable city in the country</a>.</p><aside class="insert"><form id="insertsubscribeform" class="form" method="POST"><p class="subtext">Subscribe to The Exeter Digest - Exeter Observer's essential email newsletter</p><input class="snarefortheunwary" type="text" name="snarefortheunwary" value="" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"><div class="uk-grid-small" uk-grid=""><div class="uk-width-expand@s"><input class="uk-input" type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="enter your email address" aria-required="true" required=""></div><div class="uk-width-auto@s"><button class="uk-width-1-1" type="submit" value="submit" aria-label="subscribe free">Subscribe free</button></div></div><p class="subtext">Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>-compliant <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p></form></aside><p>There are other major housing-related issues Exeter Labour’s election manifesto should address because of their importance for the city, particularly as it has been in power for so long, but about which it has nothing to say.</p><p>One is the decision to <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s82313/Report%20-%2022-23%20HRA%20Rent%20Updated%20-%20FINAL.pdf">increase council housing rents</a> by the maximum 4.1% allowed at the time as a <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/cost-living-crisis">cost of living crisis</a> sweeps through the country, with the prospect of <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2022/03/Catch-2022.pdf">inflation peaking at over 10% for poorer households</a> by the end of the year.</p><p>Another is the role played by the unelected <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/liveable-exeter-place-board/">Liveable Exeter Place Board</a>, which meets in private and does not publish its discussions or decisions. The council’s chief executive <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2020/07/14/unelected-liveable-exeter-place-board-created-by-city-council-to-take-responsibility-for-major-policies-determining-Exeter-future-development/">said its aim</a> is “to enable collective decision-making” around “issues relating to housing delivery, place shaping, economic development, clean growth and carbon neutral development”.</p><p>However perhaps the most significant of all is the size of the debt Exeter’s council tax-payers are expected to shoulder to finance the “<a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/liveable-exeter/">Liveable Exeter</a>” property development scheme if the council doesn’t change course. Its <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5953/budget-book-22-23.pdf">capital borrowing</a> is expected to reach £300 million this year after nearly doubling since 2020-21.</p></article><hr

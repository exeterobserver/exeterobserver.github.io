The remaining 350 students were registered for single terms or one semester only.</p><p>The university did not explain the very large discrepancy between its published FTE figures and those it released under freedom of information legislation, which confirm that nearly 6,000 more full-time students were based on its Exeter campuses than the combined full- and part-time student numbers that its FTE figures purport to represent.</p><p>While the university can choose what to publish on its website, its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 are legally binding. It is a <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/77">criminal offence</a> to alter or conceal information held by public authorities (including the university) with the intention of preventing disclosure following a request for the information under the Act.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-table" data-src="visualisation/11673684"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>The university also provides its published FTE numbers to the city council to inform its planning policies related to student accommodation in the city despite these numbers being of little use for this purpose. Total student numbers are instead needed, but the university does not provide these.</p><p>To estimate the extent to which Exeter’s residential housing stock is occupied by students the council instead relies on student council tax exemption records as part of a <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/12/15/pennsylvania-petitioners-expose-fifteen-years-of-flawed-exeter-city-council-student-accommodation-policy-making/">matrix of faulty premises, inaccurate information and miscalculated projections</a> on which it has based its student accommodation policies for the past fifteen years.</p><p>However the Office for National Statistics (ONS) concluded last year that <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/understandingstudentsacrossadministrativedatainenglandandwales/2021-11-26">council tax records cannot be relied on for this purpose</a> after it found that only 12% of students live in addresses solely occupied by students and around 30% live in addresses that appear to be made up of students and non-students.</p><p>It also found that only half of all student addresses have any indication on council tax that students live there.</p><p>The council says it recorded 2,551 student council tax exemptions in the city’s residential housing stock in September this year (although it told the government the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/council-taxbase-2021-in-england">number of such exemptions was higher</a>) and so concluded that 2,551 residential dwellings were occupied by students.</p><p>The ONS research suggests that at least twice as many residential dwellings are being used this way (more than the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/local-authority-housing-statistics-data-returns-for-2020-to-2021">4,800 council homes</a> in the city).</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11676159"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>The <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/12/15/pennsylvania-petitioners-expose-fifteen-years-of-flawed-exeter-city-council-student-accommodation-policy-making/">council’s student accommodation policies</a> rely on the construction of Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) to mitigate the impact of university expansion on the city’s housing stock, with the aim that 75% of additional (not all) Exeter university students are housed this way.</p><p>No evidence was provided as a basis for this policy when it was <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/1665/university-spg.doc">introduced fifteen years ago</a>, none was provided when it was reformulated for the 2012 <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/1636/adopted-core-strategy.pdf">Exeter Core Strategy</a>, currently the city’s principal planning policy document, and none has been provided since.</p><p>The core strategy is based on a projection that there would be a little over 16,000 full-time students living away from home in Exeter by 2025-26. The 2010 <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-and-planning-statements/university-of-exeter-streatham-campus-masterplan-framework-spd/">Streatham campus masterplan</a> is based on there being just 15,800 FTE students on the campus by the same year.</p><p>Well over twice that many were based there by this time last year. The <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/09/26/new-exeter-local-plan-outline-draft-consultation/">new Exeter Local Plan</a> is about to scrap the student accommodation policies contained in the core strategy but its draft version, which is currently out for consultation, has nothing to say about these issues instead.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11676138"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>Nearly 5,000 new PBSA bedspaces have been built in Exeter in the past four years. The university and private sector together provided just under 11,500 at the beginning of 2021-22.</p><p>Had all 5,300 of Exeter’s part-time university students been living at home these PBSA blocks would still only have accommodated 35% of the full-time students the university says were based at Exeter campuses that year.</p><p>There are now just under 12,500 Exeter PBSA bedspaces after completion of the second phase of the university’s East Park scheme and private developments at Mary Arches Street, Walnut Gardens and The Depot on Cheeke Street.</p><p>Were the university’s 2022-23 cohort the same size as the previous year, the extra thousand rooms would still mean only 38% of its full-time Exeter students would live in PBSA during term-time.</p><p>Both these calculations also assume that all the PBSA is full.</p><p>Consultants commissioned by the council to review Exeter’s PBSA supply this time last year found that just 70% of the 5,100 rooms then available in private PBSA were occupied (the university provided another 6,400) in line with the previous two years.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="exeter-student-pad-accommodation-map.png" alt="Exeter HMO map" width="2196" height="1235"> <a href="exeter-student-pad-accommodation-map.png" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Exeter HMO map.

That’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1074411/Dwelling_Stock_Estimates_31_March_2021.pdf">nearly three quarters</a> of the city’s stock of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants">around 11,000</a> private rented properties.</p><p>However, combining unrepresentative council tax exemption figures, private PBSA uptake estimates and HMO occupancy rate averages are unlikely to produce an accurate account of the university’s impact on the city’s residential housing stock.</p><p>Not sufficiently accurate, at any rate, to provide a basis on which to introduce the <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/12/15/pennsylvania-petitioners-expose-fifteen-years-of-flawed-exeter-city-council-student-accommodation-policy-making/">effective student accommodation policies the city needs</a>.</p><p>Which is why we also asked the university, under freedom of information legislation, to provide the true (not FTE) numbers of part-time and full-time undergraduate and postgraduate Exeter campus-based students housed both in university- and privately-provided PBSA during the 2021-22 academic year.</p><p>Then we would actually know how many of its Exeter-based students were living in private residential housing stock.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img src="exeter-purpose-built-student-accommodation-map.png" alt="Exeter PBSA map" width="1453" height="1724"> <a href="exeter-purpose-built-student-accommodation-map.png" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Exeter PBSA map.

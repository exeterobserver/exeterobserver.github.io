Its <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/haveyoursay/consultations/magdalen-road-exeter-public-consultation/">principal public consultation</a> on the changes did not provide any street usage data at all, despite inviting respondents to choose between four street use options, and only mentioned unspecified delivery costs and timescales for the low traffic street option, apparently in order to discourage respondents from choosing it.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/10188061"><script defer="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p>When a decisive majority did then choose it, the county council’s report on the consultation misrepresented its results, which it did not publish until after a decision had been taken in favour of keeping the changes that had already been made.</p><p>This option only had the support of 18% of respondents but the county council nevertheless recommended it. 25% wanted to return the street to two-way traffic.</p><p>In making this recommendation the county council also prioritised the views of just ten of the street’s retail traders over those of nearly 1,500 local residents and frequent visitors to the area.</p><p>It now wants Exeter HaTOC to cement these changes in place, claiming they will reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and encourage modal shift away from car use despite providing no evidence to support these claims.</p><p>It has nevertheless admitted that westbound traffic and traffic on adjacent roads have both increased and the changes have made car journeys in the area longer.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="st-leonards-neighbourhood-association-magdalen-road-low-traffic-street-visualisation.png" alt="St. Leonard's Neighbourhood Association Magdalen Road low traffic street visualisation" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Magdalen Road low traffic street visualisation. Image: <a href="http://www.slna.org.uk/">St. Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association</a>.</p><p class="uk-dropcap">How has Devon County Council contrived to arrive at a recommendation to spend so much public money on changes that so few people want instead of delivering the changes supported by the majority?</p><p>By the time <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=168&amp;MId=4247&amp;Ver=4">Exeter HaTOC met in July last year</a> to consider the public consultation results, twelve months after the temporary changes had been introduced, it was clear that there were numerous strong opinions on all sides of the argument.</p><p><a href="http://www.slna.org.uk/">St. Leonard’s Neighbourhood Association</a> had already conducted a <a href="http://www.slna.org.uk/Opinion%20poll%20results.html">large poll</a> which produced <a href="http://www.slna.org.uk/assets/files/Poll%20feedback.%20Future%20plans%20Negative%20comments.pdf">hundreds of critical comments</a> and a <a href="http://www.slna.org.uk/assets/files/Poll%20feedback.%20Future%20Plans.%20Positive%20comments.pdf">similar volume of positive feedback</a>.</p><p>It nevertheless found strong support for discussion of permanent pedestrian improvements alongside vehicle traffic reductions, and also generated around <a href="http://www.slna.org.uk/assets/files/Ideas%20for%20changes%20to%20existing.pdf">150 suggestions for improvements</a> to the scheme, many of which were in favour of some form of low traffic street layout.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="lorry-parked-in-loading-bay-obstructing-cycle-lane-endangering-driver.jpg" alt="Lorry parked in loading bay obstructing cycle lane endangering driver" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Lorries are unable to avoid blocking the cycle lane when parked in the HGV loading bay and their drivers are forced to unload in front of oncoming traffic.</p><p>The county council provided the July committee meeting with <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s36263/cb080721exh%20Magdalen%20Road%20Exeter%20Permanent%20Road%20Layout%20Changes.pdf">a report which summarised the consultation results</a> instead of publishing them.</p><p>It did not publish them until after the meeting had been held and the decision to make the changes permanent had been taken.</p><p>The county council’s summary report was replete with statements which misrepresented the results.</p><p>It paraphrased the result that 53% of respondents wanted a low traffic street as the option “preferred by the greatest number of respondents”.</p><p>Instead of stating that only 18% wanted to make the temporary changes permanent, it said this option “also received more positive (agree/strongly agree) than negative (disagree/strongly disagree) responses”.</p><p>(When the <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/s36386/Magdalen%20Road.pdf">consultation results</a> did appear these figures were presented as “&gt;50%” and “20%”.)</p><p>The report then went on to say that while a low traffic street “would provide the best environment for pedestrians and cyclists and provide additional street space for pavement cafes and ancillary business activity”, removing parking “could be detrimental to some of the traders”.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="lorry-parked-in-loading-bay-obstructing-cycle-lane-endangering-cyclist.jpg" alt="Lorry parked in loading bay obstructing cycle lane endangering cyclist" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> The HGV loading bay is opposite the turn to Wonford Road, making that section of the street more dangerous for eastbound cyclists when lorries are parked there.</p><p>The report’s 300-word “options discussion and appraisal” section then combined the misrepresented findings.</p><p>It mentioned in passing that 85% of respondents identified pedestrian facilities as their highest priority, but failed to mention that more people also wanted clean air, pavement cafes, wider footways and seating as well as cycling facilities than wanted on-street parking.</p><p>It then rejected both options to reverse the one way setup, on the grounds that a majority disagreed with them, without mentioning that a majority also disagreed with making the temporary changes permanent.</p><p>Instead of then concluding that it should deliver a low traffic street as the only option with majority support, further corroborated by the finding that 75% of respondents wanted to reduce through traffic to provide more space for pedestrians and cyclists, it said “the most deliverable option” was to make the temporary changes permanent.</p><p>It said this was because a low traffic street “would be the most expensive of the options to deliver and likely to require external funding” which “would create the risk of a significant delay”, but provided neither costings, nor funding, budget or design options, nor delivery timescales to support this claim.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="car-obstructing-both-lanes-during-parking-manoeuvre.jpg" alt="Car obstructing both lanes during parking manoeuvre" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> The county council says it hopes that “widening the bays will make parking easier”. Widening the bays will not make prevent vehicles obstructing both lanes during parking manoeuvres.</p><p>Nor did the report make clear that the 50:50 split it found between those retail traders in favour of and those against reducing through traffic represented only one third of the street’s 29 retail traders on each side of the argument.</p><p>The preferences of the other third were not included. (Since the scheme was introduced one third of the street’s retail traders have changed.)</p><p>It did not explain how it had weighted the views of twenty retail traders against those of nearly 1,500 other consultation respondents, almost all of whom were local residents or frequent visitors to the area.</p><p>More than 1,100 of them were in favour of reducing through traffic to provide more space for pedestrians and cyclists and nearly 1,300 identified pedestrian facilities as the most important priority.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="commercial-vehicle-congestion.jpg" alt="Commercial vehicle congestion" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Despite being a principal arterial cycling route more commercial vehicles passed through the street during our Saturday morning survey period than bicycles.

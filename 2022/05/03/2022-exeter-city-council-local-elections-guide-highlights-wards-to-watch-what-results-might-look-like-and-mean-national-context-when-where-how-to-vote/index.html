Each of thirteen electoral wards of between <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/elections-and-voting/electoral-services/electoral-statistics/">6,500 and 7,800</a> electors is represented by three councillors.</p><p>A third of the seats, one in each ward, is normally contested in each of three years, with county council elections held in the fourth year. Each city councillor thus normally serves a four year term.</p><p>Exeter’s wards have been arranged this way since <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/65/made">boundary changes</a> prompted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Exeter_City_Council_election">exceptional election</a> of the whole council at the same time in 2016, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_non-transferable_vote">multiple non-transferable vote system</a>.</p><p>This year voters in four of Exeter’s wards will elect an additional councillor by casting up to two votes on their ballot papers: three Labour councillors have resigned and a fourth died in office.</p><p>In each of the Exwick, Heavitree and Pennsylvania wards the candidate who receives the largest number of votes will be elected for a four year term and the runner-up for a one year term. In the Priory ward the runner-up will be elected for a two year term.</p><p>This means seventeen seats are being contested this year: Labour is defending fourteen of them, the Conservatives two and the Liberal Democrats one.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-parliament" data-src="visualisation/6071588"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><h2 id="labour-strongholds-">Labour strongholds</h2><p>However the ruling party has little to worry about: it only needs to win six of the seventeen to retain control of the city council as it already holds fourteen of the 22 seats that are not being contested this year.</p><p>Exwick, Mincinglake &amp; Whipton, Priory and St Thomas are all Labour strongholds, where the party won by margins of at least 15% of the vote last year after little recent change in party vote distribution. Popular councillor <a href="https://www.exeter-labour.org.uk/ecc-team/2022/03/28/311/">Laura Wright</a>, who is also deputy council leader, is defending a Labour majority of nearly a quarter of the vote in St Thomas, the largest margin in the city.</p><p>As Exwick and Priory are both electing two councillors, Labour only has to successfully defend its strongholds to retain control of the council. Council executive member <a href="https://www.exeter-labour.org.uk/ecc-team/2022/03/28/rachel/">Rachel Sutton</a> is expected to retain her seat in Exwick and Labour councillor <a href="https://www.exeter-labour.org.uk/ecc-team/2022/03/28/tony-wardle/">Tony Wardle</a> is expected to retain his in Priory.</p><p><a href="https://www.exeter-labour.org.uk/ecc-team/2022/03/28/740/">Paul Knott</a> and <a href="https://www.exeter-labour.org.uk/ecc-team/2022/03/28/marina-asvachin/">Marina Asvachin</a>, who is already a <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1124">member of the county council</a>, hope to join them on the city council in these wards.</p><p><a href="https://www.exeter-labour.org.uk/ecc-team/2022/03/28/naima-allcock/">Naima Allcock</a>, who was elected to represent Mincinglake &amp; Whipton for a one year term in 2021 following the death of Judy Pattison, is also expected to successfully defend her seat.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9769362"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><h2 id="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</h2><p>Labour also won in Pennsylvania with a margin of nearly 24% last year, where high-profile pro-nuclear campaigner <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/left-extinction-rebellion-campaign-nuclear-power/">Zion Lights</a> won a larger share of the vote than council leader <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=885">Phil Bialyk</a> in her first election.</p><p>The party’s vote share rose by more than 16% compared with 2019 in a ward which had been a two-way Conservative/Liberal Democrat contest until the 2016 boundary changes.</p><p>Pennsylvania is also electing two councillors following the death of deputy Lord Mayor <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/tributes-paid-after-death-of-exeter-s-deputy-lord-mayor/">Ian Quance</a>. While Labour are expected to win one seat, previous results suggest the Liberal Democrats may win the other.</p><p>Liberal Democrat candidate <a href="https://exeterlibdems.org.uk/en/page/your-exeter-city-council-candidates-2022">Nigel Williams</a>, who increased the party’s vote share by nearly 14% last year, is standing again this year. The Conservative vote share in the ward has been falling steadily since the 2016 boundary changes, down nearly 10% over the period, putting the Liberal Democrats on course to overtake them into second place.</p><p>The Greens did not stand in the ward in 2021 as part of an electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats, despite polling 24% of the vote in the previous contest.</p><p>However as there eight candidates on the ballot and each elector’s two votes are not cast in order of preference, vote distribution may produce unexpected results.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9769541"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><h2 id="duryard--st-james">Duryard &amp; St James</h2><p>Adjacent Duryard &amp; St James is also difficult to call. Labour councillor <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=6678">Martin Pearce</a> frustrated Liberal Democrat hopes of three wins in a row there last year by increasing the party’s vote share by nearly 15%, beating Liberal Democrat <a href="https://exeterlibdems.org.uk/en/page/your-exeter-city-council-candidates-2022">Will Aczel</a> by a margin of 7.5%.</p><p>As in Pennsylvania the Greens, who polled 12% in 2019, did not field a candidate. At the same time Women’s Equality Party candidate <a href="https://twitter.com/bea_gare">Bea Gare</a> took 7.5% of the vote, slightly more than the margin by which Martin Pearce won. She is not standing this year.</p><p>The ward turnout was also the lowest in the city at 32.45%, possibly reflecting the absence of many of the students who now dominate it.</p><p>This year Liberal Democrat <a href="https://exeterlibdems.org.uk/en/page/your-exeter-city-council-candidates-2022">Kevin Mitchell</a>, who was first elected to the council in 2003, is defending the seat in a four-way contest. He is co-leader of the Progressive group on the council with Green Party councillor <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5825">Diana Moore</a>.</p><p>The other group members are Liberal Democrat <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5827">Michael Mitchell</a>, who also represents Duryard &amp; St James, community campaigner <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5823">Jemima Moore</a>, who won a landslide in Newtown &amp; St Leonard’s in 2019 <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/04/26/exeter-local-resident-stands-independent-candidate-exeter-elections/">as an independent candidate</a> after the council closed <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/clifton-hill/">Clifton Hill sports centre</a> and earmarked the site for redevelopment, and Green Party councillor <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=6681">Amy Sparling</a>, who was elected to represent St David’s last year.</p><p>Since its formation the group has presented much of the effective opposition to Exeter City Council’s ruling Labour group despite the Conservative group being slightly larger.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9769561"><script async="" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><h2 id="green-party-bridgeheads-">Green Party bridgeheads</h2><p>Exeter’s key electoral battlegrounds are central wards which contain some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country and have also borne the brunt of a range of unpopular council policies.</p><p>These include allowing the unbridled expansion of the university to <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/03/29/council-consultants-confirm-58-percent-of-exeter-university-students-live-in-city-residential-housing-stock/">adversely affect residential housing availability</a> and <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/04/14/do-exeter-labour-election-campaign-claims-stand-up-to-scrutiny-part-1-exeter-housing-crisis/">affordability</a> and promoting city centre vehicle use despite its <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/06/23/climate-crisis-exeter-devon-carbon-reduction-ultra-low-emission-clean-air-zones-parking-levy-living-streets/">impact on air quality and the public realm</a>.</p><p>Heavitree is the city’s most marginal ward. The Green Party’s <a href="https://exeter.greenparty.org.uk/local-wards/heavitree/">Catherine Rees</a> came within sixteen votes of winning there last year, a margin of just 0.005%, after increasing the party’s vote share by nearly 26% in the closest contest in the city in the ward with the highest turnout, at 46.7%.</p><p>She is standing again this year as the party’s lead candidate alongside Green Party colleague <a href="https://exeter.greenparty.org.uk/local-wards/heavitree/">Carol Bennett</a> in a ward which will also elect two councillors.</p><p>Last year’s second closest contest saw 126 votes separate Labour from the Greens in adjacent Newtown &amp; St Leonard’s. Support for Labour incumbent <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=136">Richard Branston</a> fell by more than 12% as Dan Grey increased the Green Party’s vote share by more than 30% from 2018, after the party stood aside for independent Jemima Moore in 2019.</p><p>The Green Party’s <a href="https://exeter.greenparty.org.uk/local-wards/newtown-and-st-leonards/">Andy Ketchin</a> is fighting a tight two-way contest with Labour’s <a href="https://www.exeter-labour.org.uk/ecc-team/2022/03/28/matt-vizard/">Matt Vizard</a> there this year.

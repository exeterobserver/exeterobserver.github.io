However when a headline claim about Exeter is based on peer-reviewed academic research with a robust methodology, as it was last month, simply dismissing the hype as marketing guff is not enough.</p><p>In this case the headline was “Scientists have named Exeter city centre as the greenest in Britain based on tree cover and the presence of parks”, as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-63734755">correctly presented by BBC news</a>, although this was <a href="https://twitter.com/milesodavis/status/1595494522116521984">subsequently misrepresented</a> as “Exeter is the greenest city in Britain” on social media by a BBC journalist then repeated in that form by Exeter Labour Party and two of its councillors.</p><aside class="insert"><form id="subscribeform" class="form" action="" method="POST"><p>The Exeter Digest - Essential insight in your inbox</p><input class="snarefortheunwary" type="text" name="snarefortheunwary" value="" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"><div class="uk-grid-small" uk-grid=""><div class="uk-width-expand"><input class="uk-input" type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="enter your email address" aria-required="true" required=""></div><div class="uk-width-auto"><button class="uk-button" id="subscribeformbutton" type="submit" value="submit" aria-label="Subscribe free">Subscribe free</button></div></div><p>Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>-compliant <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><div id="subscribeformmessages"></div></form></aside><p>The substance of the story was also (more or less) correctly presented <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/how-green-is-your-city-centre-the-best-and-worst-in-britain-ranked-12753904">Sky News</a> and <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/experts-park-glasgow-at-bottom-of-british-cities-for-urban-green-space-2lg8vgkw5">The Times</a> alongside <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/138879098/news">around 150 other news channels</a>, most of which got the headline about right, although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/nov/24/study-reveals-britains-greenest-cities-and-they-are-all-in-the-south">The Guardian</a> got it wrong with “Study reveals Britain’s greenest cities”.</p><p>Local media fell into the same trap. <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/exeter-named-greenest-urban-city-7856068">Devon Live</a> went with “Exeter named greenest urban city in Britain” (repeated by <a href="https://twitter.com/mistyholland/status/1595888430428622848">another journalist</a>) and <a href="https://grow-media.co.uk/top-stories/exeter-greenest-city/">Grow Exeter</a> had “Exeter named the greenest city in Britain” (although it was only the headlines that were substantively incorrect in both stories).</p><p><a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/exeter-top-of-the-tree-for-green-open-spaces-new-report-reveals">Exeter City Council’s marketing team</a> went for a metaphor, “Exeter top of the tree for green open spaces”, which also misrepresented the source material, and added misleading context for good measure in the body too.</p><p>It may be true that “Exeter enjoys a range of green open spaces including six valley parks managed by Devon Wildlife Trust, numerous parks, sports pitches, 1,400 allotments and a number of leafy cemeteries”, but this has next to nothing to do with the research on which the story was based.</p><p>Exeter wasn’t ranked top for tree cover, either.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand;

Several London centres were included on this basis and Northern Ireland was excluded because of insufficient data.</p><p>Exeter’s city centre retail area was ranked top for vegetation cover, second for tree cover and third for publicly accessible green space. Combining these rankings placed it first overall.</p><p>Several of its central green spaces were included in the study, although the retail area boundaries meant only parts of some were counted. A total of a little over 34,000m2 of green space was identified inside the city centre retail area.</p><p>Land beside the cathedral accounted for 55% of the total and Southernhay nearly 22%. Both were included in their entirety.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="st-bartholomews-cemetery-corner.jpg" alt="St Bartholomew's Cemetery corner" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Publicly-accessible city centre retail area green space in St Bartholomew’s Cemetery.</p><p>Part of Rougemont Gardens and parts of Northernhay Gardens were also included, accounting for 20% together, and a corner of Friernhay made up just under 3%.</p><p>A tiny 46m2 triangle in St Bartholomew’s Cemetery and 2m2 of St David’s churchyard were also inside the boundary, if difficult to access on the ground.</p><p>Members of the public were quick to observe not only that the study concerned city centres, not whole cities, but also that a lot of these spaces are not really part of Exeter’s city centre retail area.</p><p>They also pointed out that the research results largely reflect the inclusion of land around an 11th century cathedral and castle and a 13th century meadow in the retail area.</p><p>That most of cathedral green has been covered with market stalls for the past month and a fun fair is nearly filling Northernhay Gardens did not escape people either.</p><div uk-lightbox=""><div class="uk-inline"><span uk-icon="icon: expand; ratio: 2"></span> <img data-src="exeter-city-centre-retail-area-map-small.png" alt="Exeter city centre retail area map" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> <a href="exeter-city-centre-retail-area-map.png" data-alt="Exeter city centre retail area map" class="uk-position-cover uk-overlay"></a></div></div><p class="uk-text-center caption">Contains ESRC CDRC data inc.

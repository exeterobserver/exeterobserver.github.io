It approved Â£350,000 for a <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=4471">company feasibility study</a> this way in October 2016, then just over Â£260,000 for <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=5304">business case preparation and company formation</a> in February 2018.</p><p>In July 2018 it <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgDecisionDetails.aspx?IId=39740&amp;Opt=1">approved a loan</a> of Â£4.25 million to the newly-formed company as well as a <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=39740&amp;PlanId=0&amp;Opt=3#AI40485">business plan</a> detailing its proposed operational activities and development works to March 2019. A <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=634&amp;MId=5278">council committee</a> had scrutinised the plans, partly in private, but the substance of the decision was made in public with only limited redaction of sensitive financial information in compliance with the law.</p><p>The late Pete Edwards, then council leader, made clear at the time that the council would continue with this approach. <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=43707">He said</a>: âThe business case and annual business plans would be subject to the same presumption in favour of being made publicly availableâ with only limited, legally compliant exceptions to cover sensitive financial information.</p><p>However by February 2019 things had changed. The council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6335">approved another loan</a> to the company, this time for Â£5 million for âbusiness operations and development activityâ, and the companyâs 2019-20 business plan, which laid out its intended âoperational activities and development worksâ.</p><p>This decision was taken in private without 28 daysâ clear notice, and the companyâs 2019-20 business plan was not published at all.</p><p><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=5808">Three months later</a> Phil Bialyk proposed <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/10/09/exeter-city-council-reduces-scrutiny-decision-making/">dramatic cuts to executive decision-making scrutiny</a> at his first executive meeting as the new council leader.</p><p>The changes swept away the councilâs previous approach to scrutiny, which <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Exeter%20City%20Council.pdf">had been praised</a> by the Local Government Association, and removed opposition leaders from its executive so it became exclusively composed of Labour councillors.</p><p>The councilâs scrutiny committees were already chaired by Labour members, as is the board which controls scrutiny committee agendas, which meets in private and does not publish its proceedings. Labour also holds <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/14/exeter-local-elections-results-may-2021-exeter-city-council-devon-county-council-devon-and-cornwall-police-and-crime-commissioner/">28 of 39 seats on the full council</a>.</p><p>The council has since sought to take all its decisions about Exeter City Living in private.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="exeter-city-council-cuts-executive-decision-making-scrutiny.avif" alt="Exeter City Council cuts executive decision-making scrutiny" width="800" height="450"> Council leader Phil Bialyk cutting executive decision-making scrutiny, with council chief executive Karime Hassan.</p><p>Two months after the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=48117">scrutiny cuts were finalised</a> in October 2019 the council published notices of its intention to hold two parts of its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MID=6197">January executive meeting</a> in private. One concerned a â<a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=45710&amp;PlanId=187&amp;RPID=11310432">Clifton Hill site report</a>â and the other a â<a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=45574&amp;PlanId=187&amp;RPID=11310432">Special Report on Clifton Hill</a>â. No more details were provided about the first, and the second only said: âReport from the Director (DB) on Clifton Hillâ.</p><p>The reality was that the first was to approve a Â£16 million loan to Exeter City Living for the controversial redevelopment of the Clifton Hill sports centre site and the second was to approve the sale of the site at a discount of more than Â£2 million to the company.</p><p>The notices were published on 17 December 2019, less than 28 daysâ clear of the meeting. Neither provided sufficient details to make representations as to why the meeting should be held openly.

Citing the House of Commons <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/127/public-accounts-committee">Public Accounts Committee</a> as a model for scrutiny rigour, it said its key characteristic is that âit is chaired by a member of the official opposition and its members, of all political parties, are required to demonstrate robust challengeâ.</p><div class="insert"><form id="insertsubscribeform" class="form" method="POST"><p class="subtext">Subscribe to The Exeter Digest - Exeter Observer's essential free email newsletter</p><input type="text" name="snarefortheunwary" class="snarefortheunwary" value="" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"><subscribe-form><input type="email" name="email" autocomplete="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="enter your email address" aria-required="true" required=""> <button type="submit" value="submit" aria-label="subscribe free">Subscribe free</button></subscribe-form><p class="subtext">Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>-compliant <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a></p></form></div><p>In January this year a housing subsidiary of Cambridgeshire County Council to which it loaned Â£114 million was <a href="https://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2022/01/council-housing-subsidiary-business-case-risk">reported</a> to be at risk of failing to deliver on its business case, and last month <a href="https://democracy.croydon.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=35451">Grant Thornton issued</a> a second Report in the Public Interest regarding Croydon council, this time focussed on its failed wholly-owned <a href="https://insidecroydon.com/tag/brick-by-brick/">Brick by Brick</a> development company.</p><p>It identified âserious corporate and governance failingsâ and âsignificant concerns regarding decision-making, value for money, behaviour and governance arrangementsâ, concluding that the council âfailed to ensure it was acting lawfullyâ. A <a href="https://www.lgcplus.com/finance/met-sent-croydon-public-interest-report-11-02-2022/">criminal investigation</a> may follow.</p><p>The auditorâs findings echoed previous <a

guidance</a> identifying indicators of weak local authority governance.</p><p>These included inadequate scrutiny, transparency and public consultation and a lack of awareness and acceptance of the need for improvement, citing examples in which scrutiny had been weakened by council domination by one political party and lack of transparency in decision-making processes.</p></article><hr

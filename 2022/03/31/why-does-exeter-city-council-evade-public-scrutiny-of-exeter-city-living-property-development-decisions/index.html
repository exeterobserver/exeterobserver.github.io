Decisions taken in breach of the regulations may be unlawful and ineffective, could constitute maladministration and may be subject to judicial review, putting the council at risk.</p><p>To explore exposure to similar risks elsewhere in Exeter City Council decision-making we examined all the significant decisions it has so far made regarding Exeter City Living’s financial, operational and development plans — a mix of business case and business plan production and loan and site sale approvals.</p><p>We found that most of these decisions also apparently breached local government regulations intended to protect the public interest in the use of public land and money particularly when, as is the case in Exeter, the council is the planning authority and intends to develop its own property.</p><p>We also found governance arrangements which appear to have undermined effective scrutiny of decision-making about the company, as well as decisions that have been made without any scrutiny at all.</p><div class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="who-might-take-legal-action-over-the-councils-development-decisions">Who might take legal action over the council’s development decisions?</h3><p>Private sector property developers with in-house legal teams who may not like the council’s plans to dominate Exeter residential development?</p><p>Community campaigners who are incensed at the council’s decision to <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/11/19/exeter-city-council-approves-second-harlequins-co-living-block-sealing-fate-of-paul-street/">redevelop Harlequins shopping centre</a> for student accommodation and may want to contest its development plans elsewhere, especially <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/07/08/river-exe-green-spaces-and-heritage-harbour-site-threatened-by-liveable-exeter-development-scheme/">in the Exe valley</a>?</p><p>Liveable Exeter development site owners who may want to challenge the compulsory purchase of their property under the New Development Corporation powers the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s83358/9.%20Corporate%20Risk%20Register%20report%20Appendix%20Final.pdf">council says it will use</a> when it acquires them?</p></div><p>While public access to local authority meetings and documents is <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/part/VA">required by law</a>, there are allowances for councils to exclude the public from parts of their meetings, and withhold related information, in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/12A">specific circumstances</a> in which the public interest is better served by denying public access than allowing it.</p><p>But there is an important exception which directly affects Exeter City Living.</p><p>The public cannot be excluded from part of a meeting, and information cannot be exempt from disclosure, if “it relates to proposed development for which the local planning authority may grant itself planning permission, or permission in principle, pursuant to regulation 3 of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/1492/made">Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992</a>”.

The council told us that its chief executive took this decision in private in March 2021 in consultation with the chief financial officer, council leader and relevant portfolio holders.</p><p>It said this was because the company’s 2020-21 business plan had not been adopted until July 2020 and “it was not practicable or a good use of resources to undertake the work for a new business plan when the 2020-21 business plan had still to be implemented and no new sites or funding were required for the 2021-2022 business plan period”.</p><p>The others were the decisions <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5679/statement-of-accounts-2020-21-pre-audit.pdf">not to pursue the subsidiary consultancy or retrofit companies</a> to which a share of the previously-approved £300,000 business case development funding had been allocated.</p><p>The council’s chief executive, who has been the council’s Exeter City Group Shareholder Representative <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6203">since September 2020</a>, took both these decisions in private on 19 April 2021.</p><p>The council says the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s64867/App%20D%20-%20Shareholder%20Rep%20Delegated%20Powers.pdf">powers</a> it delegated to the Shareholder Representative <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=5797">immediately after</a> incorporating the companies were sufficient to have taken these decisions like this.

The Act <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/88/pdfs/uksiem_20060088_en.pdf">prompted</a> a major <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmjust/96/96we17.htm">revision</a> of the local government information transparency provisions when it came into force, since when <a href="https://cfgs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Pulling-it-together.pdf">it has determined their extent</a>.</p><p>Information access judgements have further reduced the scope of this exemption over time. Simply referring to a risk of reduced profits or impaired negotiating ability may no longer be sufficient to engage it, and the public interest in matters involving spatial development and decision-making in general have significant weight.</p><p>In particular, disclosure of headline information such as the sale or rental value of housing resulting from development has been judged not to harm developers’ commercial interests as market rates on completion are held to be much more significant.</p><p>Minor information such as the value of individual subcontracts may be judged to be commercially sensitive, but only where the sensitivity of each element is demonstrated in detail.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="anthony-road-exeter-city-living-development.avif" alt="Anthony Road Exeter City Living development" width="800" height="450"> Anthony Road: Exeter City Living oversaw construction of three 3-bed houses here intending to sell them on the open market but when they remained unsold Exeter City Council bought them for £900,000 for council housing instead.</p><p>In addition, the extent to which Exeter City Living is a commercial company, and so the extent to which its affairs can be considered commercially sensitive, is restricted by its local authority-owned “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/libraries-alternative-delivery-models-toolkit/alternative-delivery-models-explained">Teckal</a>” status which <a href="https://www.cipfa.org/policy-and-guidance/articles/teckal-the-basics-explained">largely prohibits</a> it from trading on the open market.</p><p>The company borrows money from the council to buy council land which is not offered for open sale, sometimes at preferential rates, and to commission the construction of houses all of which have so far been sold back to the council. Or it is commissioned directly by the council (via its Teckal exemption from EU procurement rules) to build council housing on council land.</p><p>The council directs the company and determines its viability, paying development and planning costs and providing privileged access to finance and land while allocating significant public expenditure to support its plans which does not appear on the company’s balance sheet.</p><p>The company also receives government grants as a council subsidiary and has yet to sell or rent any housing on the open market.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="hockings-green-exeter-city-living-development.avif" alt="Hockings Green Exeter City Living development" width="800" height="450"> Hockings Green: Exeter City Living oversaw construction of nine 3-bed council houses here at a cost of £2.6 million.</p><p>Instead of simply claiming blanket commercial confidentiality for all information relating to Exeter City Living, the council should disclose all but very granular information, as promised by its leader when the company was set up.</p><p>The sensitivity of the information it does not disclose should be demonstrated in detail in the context of the company’s essentially non-commercial operations to avoid breaching local government transparency regulations and so putting related decisions at risk.</p><p>Headline information such as the projected price of housing for sale or rent that the council is building in Exeter is precisely the information that the public interest demands should be disclosed, to enable public consideration of whether Exeter City Living is delivering best value in its use of public land and money.</p><p>The council has so far allocated nearly £1 million to the company for start up and planning costs, loaned it nearly £25 million for development delivery, gifted it more than £2 million in land purchase discounts and commissioned or purchased just over £20 million of housing.</p><p>The company has also been granted more than £7 million of central government financial support, yet it has so far completed just 22 housing units.</p><p>There are more in the company’s development pipeline, but it has already taken more than five years to get this far. Is this “building at pace and scale” as the council’s <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6203">chief executive says</a>? Will the company “disrupt the private rental market in Exeter” as the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=51849">council leader says</a>?</p><p>With 57,000 dwellings in Exeter, of which 11,000 are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants">estimated to be privately rented</a>, the company is currently a long way short of doing either.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="bovemoors-lane-exeter-city-living-development.avif" alt="Bovemoors Lane Exeter City Living development" width="800" height="450"> Bovemoors Lane: Exeter City Living oversaw construction of ten 3-bed council houses here with ‘B’ grade energy ratings (the same as Anthony Road and Hockings Green) at a cost of £2.08 million.</p><p class="dropcap">Exeter City Living’s financing, activities and development plans are of vital public interest, both because local voters are entitled to know what the council is doing with public land and money and because of potential exposure to risk, not only from decisions that may breach local government legislation but also from wider challenges the company may face.</p><p>Development sector risks are all too apparent in the recent bankruptcy of Midas, which was headquartered at Pynes Hill, following its first loss in 40 years of trading on revenue of £291 million. Brexit, the coronavirus pandemic, labour shortages and materials price inflation, all of which it said brought it down, continue to affect every construction company in the country.</p><p>But there also is rising concern over the <a href="https://www.cipfa.org/cipfa-thinks/articles/council-owned-companies">risks associated with council-owned companies</a> more generally. Last year local authority auditor <a href="https://www.grantthornton.co.uk/globalassets/1.-member-firms/united-kingdom/pdf/publication/2021/lessons-from-public-interest-reports-2021.pdf">Grant Thornton reviewed</a> three recent Reports in the Public Interest which addressed major financial problems at councils in Croydon, Northampton and Nottingham.</p><p>Nottingham City Council had made large losses with a wholly-owned energy company as a result of inadequate governance arrangements which <a href="https://www.nottinghamcity.gov.uk/media/2835756/report-in-the-public-interest-rhe.pdf">Grant Thornton said</a> had “led to institutional blindness” which downplayed the concerns that had been raised.</p><p>In its review the auditor highlighted the risk of optimism bias in local authority management of public money and criticised council pursuit of political objectives without effective scrutiny. It said these can lead to failures to understand the risks of embarking on complex, major projects without appropriate due diligence.</p><p>It emphasised the value of decision-making scrutiny and the importance of councils being willing to accept challenges. Citing the House of Commons <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/127/public-accounts-committee">Public Accounts Committee</a> as a model for scrutiny rigour, it said its key characteristic is that “it is chaired by a member of the official opposition and its members, of all political parties, are required to demonstrate robust challenge”.</p><div class="insert"><form id="insertsubscribeform" method="POST" novalidate=""><p>Subscribe to The Exeter Digest - Exeter Observer's essential free email newsletter</p><subscribe-form><input type="text" name="snarefortheunwary" class="snarefortheunwary" value="" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"> <input type="email" name="email" autocomplete="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="enter your email address" aria-required="true" required=""> <button type="submit" value="submit" aria-label="subscribe free">Subscribe free</button></subscribe-form><p>Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></p></form></div><p>In January this year a housing subsidiary of Cambridgeshire County Council to which it loaned £114 million was <a href="https://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2022/01/council-housing-subsidiary-business-case-risk">reported</a> to be at risk of failing to deliver on its business case, and last month <a href="https://democracy.croydon.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=35451">Grant Thornton issued</a> a second Report in the Public Interest regarding Croydon council, this time focussed on its failed wholly-owned <a href="https://insidecroydon.com/tag/brick-by-brick/">Brick by Brick</a> development company.</p><p>It identified “serious corporate and governance failings” and “significant concerns regarding decision-making, value for money, behaviour and governance arrangements”, concluding that the council “failed to ensure it was acting lawfully”.

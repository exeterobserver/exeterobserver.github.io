Decisions taken in breach of the regulations may be unlawful and ineffective, could constitute maladministration and may be subject to judicial review, putting the council at risk.</p><p>To explore exposure to similar risks elsewhere in Exeter City Council decision-making we examined all the significant decisions it has so far made regarding Exeter City Living’s financial, operational and development plans — a mix of business case and business plan production and loan and site sale approvals.</p><p>We found that most of these decisions also apparently breached local government regulations intended to protect the public interest in the use of public land and money particularly when, as is the case in Exeter, the council is the planning authority and intends to develop its own property.</p><p>We also found governance arrangements which appear to have undermined effective scrutiny of decision-making about the company, as well as decisions that have been made without any scrutiny at all.</p><aside class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="who-might-take-legal-action-over-the-councils-development-decisions">Who might take legal action over the council’s development decisions?</h3><p>Private sector property developers with in-house legal teams who may not like the council’s plans to dominate Exeter residential development?</p><p>Community campaigners who are incensed at the council’s decision to <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/11/19/exeter-city-council-approves-second-harlequins-co-living-block-sealing-fate-of-paul-street/">redevelop Harlequins shopping centre</a> for student accommodation and may want to contest its development plans elsewhere, especially <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/07/08/river-exe-green-spaces-and-heritage-harbour-site-threatened-by-liveable-exeter-development-scheme/">in the Exe valley</a>?</p><p>Liveable Exeter development site owners who may want to challenge the compulsory purchase of their property under the New Development Corporation powers the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s83358/9.%20Corporate%20Risk%20Register%20report%20Appendix%20Final.pdf">council says it will use</a> when it acquires them?</p></aside><p>While public access to local authority meetings and documents is <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/part/VA">required by law</a>, there are allowances for councils to exclude the public from parts of their meetings, and withhold related information, in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/schedule/12A">specific circumstances</a> in which the public interest is better served by denying public access than allowing it.</p><p>But there is an important exception which directly affects Exeter City Living.</p><p>The public cannot be excluded from part of a meeting, and information cannot be exempt from disclosure, if “it relates to proposed development for which the local planning authority may grant itself planning permission, or permission in principle, pursuant to regulation 3 of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/1492/made">Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992</a>”.

It approved £350,000 for a <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=4471">company feasibility study</a> this way in October 2016, then just over £260,000 for <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=5304">business case preparation and company formation</a> in February 2018.</p><p>In July 2018 it <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgDecisionDetails.aspx?IId=39740&amp;Opt=1">approved a loan</a> of £4.25 million to the newly-formed company as well as a <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieIssueDetails.aspx?IId=39740&amp;PlanId=0&amp;Opt=3#AI40485">business plan</a> detailing its proposed operational activities and development works to March 2019. A <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=634&amp;MId=5278">council committee</a> had scrutinised the plans, partly in private, but the substance of the decision was made in public with only limited redaction of sensitive financial information in compliance with the law.</p><p>The late Pete Edwards, then council leader, made clear at the time that the council would continue with this approach. <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=43707">He said</a>: “The business case and annual business plans would be subject to the same presumption in favour of being made publicly available” with only limited, legally compliant exceptions to cover sensitive financial information.</p><p>However by February 2019 things had changed. The council <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6335">approved another loan</a> to the company, this time for £5 million for “business operations and development activity”, and the company’s 2019-20 business plan, which laid out its intended “operational activities and development works”.</p><p>This decision was taken in private without 28 days’ clear notice, and the company’s 2019-20 business plan was not published at all.</p><p><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=5808">Three months later</a> Phil Bialyk proposed <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2019/10/09/exeter-city-council-reduces-scrutiny-decision-making/">dramatic cuts to executive decision-making scrutiny</a> at his first executive meeting as the new council leader.</p><p>The changes swept away the council’s previous approach to scrutiny, which <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Exeter%20City%20Council.pdf">had been praised</a> by the Local Government Association, and removed opposition leaders from its executive so it became exclusively composed of Labour councillors.</p><p>The council’s scrutiny committees were already chaired by Labour members, as is the board which controls scrutiny committee agendas, which meets in private and does not publish its proceedings. Labour also holds <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2021/05/14/exeter-local-elections-results-may-2021-exeter-city-council-devon-county-council-devon-and-cornwall-police-and-crime-commissioner/">28 of 39 seats on the full council</a>.</p><p>The council has since sought to take all its decisions about Exeter City Living in private.</p><p class="uk-text-center caption"><img data-src="exeter-city-council-cuts-executive-decision-making-scrutiny.jpg" alt="Exeter City Council cuts executive decision-making scrutiny" data-width="" data-height="" uk-img=""> Council leader Phil Bialyk cutting executive decision-making scrutiny, with council chief executive Karime Hassan.</p><p>Two months after the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=48117">scrutiny cuts were finalised</a> in October 2019 the council published notices of its intention to hold two parts of its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MID=6197">January executive meeting</a> in private. One concerned a “<a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=45710&amp;PlanId=187&amp;RPID=11310432">Clifton Hill site report</a>” and the other a “<a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=45574&amp;PlanId=187&amp;RPID=11310432">Special Report on Clifton Hill</a>”. No more details were provided about the first, and the second only said: “Report from the Director (DB) on Clifton Hill”.</p><p>The reality was that the first was to approve a £16 million loan to Exeter City Living for the controversial redevelopment of the Clifton Hill sports centre site and the second was to approve the sale of the site at a discount of more than £2 million to the company.</p><p>The notices were published on 17 December 2019, less than 28 days’ clear of the meeting. Neither provided sufficient details to make representations as to why the meeting should be held openly.

The council told us that its chief executive took this decision in private in March 2021 in consultation with the chief financial officer, council leader and relevant portfolio holders.</p><p>It said this was because the company’s 2020-21 business plan had not been adopted until July 2020 and “it was not practicable or a good use of resources to undertake the work for a new business plan when the 2020-21 business plan had still to be implemented and no new sites or funding were required for the 2021-2022 business plan period”.</p><p>The others were the decisions <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/5679/statement-of-accounts-2020-21-pre-audit.pdf">not to pursue the subsidiary consultancy or retrofit companies</a> to which a share of the previously-approved £300,000 business case development funding had been allocated.</p><p>The council’s chief executive, who has been the council’s Exeter City Group Shareholder Representative <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=112&amp;MId=6203">since September 2020</a>, took both these decisions in private on 19 April 2021.</p><p>The council says the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s64867/App%20D%20-%20Shareholder%20Rep%20Delegated%20Powers.pdf">powers</a> it delegated to the Shareholder Representative <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=114&amp;MId=5797">immediately after</a> incorporating the companies were sufficient to have taken these decisions like this.

Citing the House of Commons <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/127/public-accounts-committee">Public Accounts Committee</a> as a model for scrutiny rigour, it said its key characteristic is that “it is chaired by a member of the official opposition and its members, of all political parties, are required to demonstrate robust challenge”.</p><aside class="box support"><h5>Reclaim local journalism</h5><p>Exeter Observer is a new kind of <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/about/exeter-observer/">community news organisation</a> which aims to strengthen civil society and help people participate more effectively in local democracy.</p><p>Together we can deliver the independent public interest journalism Exeter needs.</p><div class="uk-text-right"><a href="/support/" class="uk-badge">Support our work<span uk-icon="icon: arrow-right; ratio: 1.5"></span></a></div></aside><p>In January this year a housing subsidiary of Cambridgeshire County Council to which it loaned £114 million was <a href="https://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2022/01/council-housing-subsidiary-business-case-risk">reported</a> to be at risk of failing to deliver on its business case, and last month <a href="https://democracy.croydon.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=35451">Grant Thornton issued</a> a second Report in the Public Interest regarding Croydon council, this time focussed on its failed wholly-owned <a href="https://insidecroydon.com/tag/brick-by-brick/">Brick by Brick</a> development company.</p><p>It identified “serious corporate and governance failings” and “significant concerns regarding decision-making, value for money, behaviour and governance arrangements”, concluding that the council “failed to ensure it was acting lawfully”.

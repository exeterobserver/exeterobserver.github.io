The “<a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/local-government-unitarisation">unitarisation</a>” of local government – the replacement of two-tier county and district councils with new unitary authorities – which has so far led to 71% of the UK population living under <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN07104/SN07104.pdf">132 single-tier authorities</a> – would now be completed by the dissolution of the remaining 21 two-tier county councils and the 164 district councils into which they are divided.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" class="imageborder" src="local-authority-structure-in-england-december-2024.avif" alt="Local authority structure in England, December 2024 map" width="800" height="560"> Local authority structure in England, December 2024. Source: <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/is-my-council-going-to-be-abolished/">House of Commons Library</a>.</p><p>The budget mini-reveal followed a decade of ad hoc, patchwork <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution">devolution</a> that had left half the country untouched while producing a jumble of deals in the rest that vary in style and substance. Eleven of the new combined authorities are led by directly-elected mayors – but not in Devon or Cornwall.</p><p>Cornish devolution has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_devolution">long and complex history that dates back centuries</a>. More recently, after being formed as a unitary authority in 2009, Cornwall Council became the first local authority in England to receive special devolved powers in 2015.</p><p>By the end of 2022 it was being offered significant funding and greater independence from central government in a “<a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/devolution/devolution-hub/devolution-deals">level three</a>” deal provided it agreed to the creation of a directly-elected Mayor. However it abandoned the deal because of public opposition and instead <a href="https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/people-and-communities/cornwall-devolution-deal/">agreed a “level two” deal</a> in November 2023.</p><p>At the same time momentum began gathering in favour of a Cornish assembly or senate like those in Wales and Scotland, and the government agreed to develop a Cornwall white paper. Then last year’s general election halted the process.</p><p>In September Cornwall’s newly-elected MPs and council group leaders wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister seeking a devolution deal discussion based on two non-negotiable premises – no mayor and a Cornwall-only footprint – but no meeting took place.</p><p>Local government minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McMahon_(politician)">Jim McMahon</a> nevertheless subsequently said, in <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2024-12-02/debates/36911F3E-9A6F-4197-8460-C2C0CE3C42DF/TopicalQuestions#contribution-894603C3-2A0C-4140-BE60-5A1E57584B0A">response to a question in the House of Commons</a>, that Cornwall’s current level two deal was a “first step”.</p><p>He added: “We recognise the distinct culture, history and identity of the Cornish people. This important step will allow us to unlock deeper devolution in Cornwall and, in time, we hope it will allow Cornwall to take its seat at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_Nations_and_Regions">Council of the Nations and Regions</a>.”</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" class="imageborder" src="devon-torbay-combined-county-authority-governance-structure.avif" alt="Devon &amp; Torbay Combined County Authority governance structure diagram" width="800" height="450"> Devon &amp; Torbay Combined County Authority governance structure.

Current non-mayoral “level two” devolved authorities like Cornwall Council and the Devon &amp; Torbay Combined County Authority will automatically become “Foundation Strategic Authorities” under the new system. By definition these do not have mayors, nor can they.</p><p>Current mayoral devolved authorities, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London_Authority">Greater London Authority</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester_Combined_Authority">Greater Manchester Combined Authority</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Midlands_Combined_County_Authority">East Midlands Combined County Authority</a> will become “Mayoral Strategic Authorities”.</p><p>Those of these that meet certain criteria will be designated “Established Mayoral Strategic Authorities”, a status upgrade that comes with a promise of more money in the form of an “Integrated Settlement”, a euphemism for core central government grant funding.</p><p>There is nothing in the white paper about the value of this funding, which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury">Treasury</a> will apparently control, and there is no sign of <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/reforming-local-government-funding-england-issues-and-options">meaningful local government funding reform</a> or <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/4.104%20Fiscal%20Devolution_05%20%28002%29.pdf">fiscal devolution</a> either.</p><p>The white paper promotes the devolution it proposes as offering “unprecedented powers and budgets for mayors”, but it appears that these budgets are to be funded by consolidating local government service delivery in the hope of cutting costs.</p><p>It cites a <a href="https://www.countycouncilsnetwork.org.uk/download/3148/">2020 PwC report</a> which “estimated that reorganisation of the then 25 two-tier areas to a single unitary structure would have a one-off cost of £400 million, with the potential to realise £2.9 billion over five years, with an annual post-implementation net recurring saving of £700 million.”</p><p>However <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_Council">Somerset Council</a> has <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/local-government-unitarisation">since been created</a> to replace the county council and four district councils, becoming England’s second largest unitary authority, with a population of 581,000.</p><p>It was expected to save £18.5 million a year as a result, but <a href="https://www.somerset.gov.uk/news/council-steps-up-response-to-financial-emergency/">declared a “financial emergency” six months after its formation in April 2023</a>, projecting an overspend of £27 million that year and a deficit of £100 million the following year.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="evaluating-the-importance-of-scale-in-proposals-for-local-government-reorganisation-august-2020.avif" alt="Evaluating the importance of scale in proposals for local government reorganisation - August 2020" width="800" height="450"> <a class="imagelink" href="https://www.countycouncilsnetwork.org.uk/new-analysis-reveals-that-single-unitary-councils-could-deliver-3bn-saving-over-five-years-and-maximise-the-benefits-of-economic-growth-and-housing-policy/"></a> Evaluating the importance of scale in proposals for local government reorganisation - PwC, August 2020.

It says the government’s “strong preference” is for “partnerships that bring more than one local authority together over a large geography” with a directly-elected mayor.</p><p>Reinforcing the point, it says: “Our ambition remains for all parts of England to ultimately have a Mayoral (and eventually Established Mayoral) Strategic Authority.”</p><p>It sets out geography and governance criteria against which it says it will assess strategic authority proposals, with the caveat that it “will not be possible to meet all the principles in all situations and the government will work with areas to find an optimal outcome”.</p><p>It says the “default assumption” is that strategic authorities will cover an area with a population of 1.5 million or more, although it accepts that “in some places, smaller authorities may be necessary”.</p><p>It also says strategic authorities “must cover sensible economic geographies with a particular focus on functional economic areas, reflecting current and potential travel-to-work patterns and local labour markets”.</p><p>Any proposed geography “must be contiguous across its constituent councils” and must not create “devolution islands” by “leaving areas which are too small to go it alone”.</p><p>Geographies should also “ensure the effective delivery of key functions” including spatial development and transport planning and enable local residents to “engage with and hold their devolved institutions to account”.</p><p>In perhaps the biggest ask of all, at least in the South West peninsula, the white paper also says they should also “promote alignment between devolution boundaries and other public sector boundaries”.</p><div class="insert"><form id="insertsubscribeform" method="POST" novalidate=""><p>Subscribe to The Exeter Digest - Exeter Observer's essential free email newsletter</p><subscribe-form><input type="text" name="snarefortheunwary" class="snarefortheunwary" value="" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"> <input type="email" name="email" autocomplete="email" placeholder="Enter your email address" aria-label="enter your email address" aria-required="true" required=""> <button type="submit" value="submit" aria-label="subscribe free">Subscribe free</button></subscribe-form><p>Your personal information will be processed and stored in accordance with our <a href="/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></p></form></div><p class="dropcap">The white paper has considerably less to say about the new unitary councils that the government wants to see created below the strategic authority level. These will be called “principal authorities” in the new system.</p><p>It says they “must be the right size to achieve efficiencies, improve capacity and withstand financial shocks” which, in most cases, “will mean creating councils with a population of 500,000 or more”, but does not provide any rationale for setting this threshold, which only eleven existing unitaries meet.</p><p>It nevertheless adds that “there may be exceptions to ensure new structures make sense for an area” and “decisions will be on a case-by-case basis”.</p><p>When asked to provide evidence in support of the 500,000 unitary population size threshold, and how it was calculated, <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/analysis_of_500000_population_si/response/2891431/attach/3/FOI2024%2032032.pdf">all MHCLG could come up with was the reference to the PwC report</a>.</p><p>All this has to say on the subject is: “Much debate has taken place as to the optimum size of the unitary authorities. Drawing on previous research from 2006, a population threshold of 300,000 to 800,000 has commonly been cited.</p><p>“While the government is yet to formally set out its position, the most recent official Ministerial statement on unitary population size was made in June [2020], and outlined that unitary councils are expected to be ‘substantially in excess of 300-400,000’”.</p><p>It adds, optimistically as it turns out: “It is anticipated that the white paper will provide further details on the criteria for unitary proposals.”</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" class="imageborder" src="ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government-information-request-response-january-2025.avif" alt="Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government information request response, January 2025" width="800" height="635"> <a class="imagelink" href="ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government-information-request-response-january-2025.pdf"></a> Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government information request response, January 2025.

What it does say is that executive functions are all those that are not reserved to the full council (such as framework decisions) or otherwise specified in legislation or delegated to another committee.</p><p><a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/strategic-leadership-team/director-of-legal-and-democratic-services-2/">Maria Price</a> then said that the matter had been brought before a full council meeting only to hear its views so council leader <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=161">James McInnes</a> would be better-informed when he wrote to the government.</p><p>John Hart, repeating the same formula from the chair, said: “We don’t have to have this meeting, the leader has the right under standing orders to do a letter in his own right. We have got here a meeting to give everybody the opportunity to say their views on what’s going on.”</p><p>It would seem, then, that the county council called the meeting to make a framework decision, failed to publish the report on which the framework decision depended until less than 24 hours before the meeting convened, then told everyone present that it was not making a decision at all.</p><p>It’s rather odd, then, that the <a href="https://democracy.devon.gov.uk/documents/g5318/Decisions%2009th-Jan-2025%2010.00%20Council.pdf?T=2">county council issued a decision notice later that day</a> exactly as if it had made a decision.

He also said he hoped to get the other districts to agree with Exeter going its own way but it might well be that they would not.</p><p>He added that he is “convinced government is not for watering down urban cities such as Exeter, economic drivers, together with places like Norwich, Lincoln, Ipswich, Cambridge, Oxford. These are all important cathedral cities, university cities.” While not all these places are cathedral or university cities, what they do have in common is that their councils are all Labour-led under county councils that are not, facing extinction under the government’s reforms.</p><p>Despite warnings from opposition benches about the risks of a directly-elected regional mayor, the democratic deficit the planned reforms will create, the likelihood that Exeter exceptionalism is unlikely to make much of an impact in Westminster and the risk that the government will impose reorganisation if Devon’s councils cannot agree, the city council backed the proposals.</p><p>The next day it wrote to government to oppose a single Devon unitary, support a peninsula mayoral authority and throw Exeter’s hat into the unitary status ring.</p><p>It did not oppose the cancellation of the local elections or the county council’s fast-track application, despite city council leader <a

authority under the new system.</p><p>Others said that the government’s intended timetable was post-haste whether fast-track or not, and that a new strategic authority could hardly be needed in Devon

aside” the view of nearly a million Devon residents “in the interest of a political party holding onto power as an unelected administration”.</p><p>He added: “Without a clear public mandate for change, reorganisation of the scale needed represents an undemocratic centralisation of power away from local communities.”</p><p>Councillors in North Devon nevertheless observed that the Labour leaderships in Exeter and Plymouth were already discussing their expansion plans with the government in private.</p><p>Others in Torridge said that the government had effectively already approved these plans, to ensure both Labour-led councils would have significant influence over subsequent strategic authority decision-making, and that all that remained was to discuss how to deal with the rest of the county.</p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VkzlR1vQlaU" style="aspect-ratio:16/9"></iframe><p class="caption">Torridge District Council meeting, 9

Cornwall’s inclusion is vital to creating a cohesive peninsula-wide strategic authority that truly represents the South West’s unique characteristics and challenges.”</p><p>Council leader <a href="https://democracy.plymouth.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=39">Tudor Evans</a> said the new system offered an opportunity for the peninsula to speak and act together for the first time, but that the ambitions of all its parts, especially Cornwall, would need to be properly acknowledged.</p><p>He added that only the whole peninsula could satisfy the 1.5 million strategic authority threshold specified in the white paper.</p><p>He also said that the government’s scale requirements for the new unitaries presented an opportunity for Plymouth City Council to expand its boundaries, but added that it would want to make a case to stay at the centre of an urban authority rather than being subsumed into a larger rural authority.</p><p>Torbay Council was more circumspect still. Its <a href="https://www.torbay.gov.uk/DemocraticServices/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=741&amp;MId=26517">cabinet met on 9 January</a> and expressed its support for a peninsula-wide Mayoral Strategic Authority, but resolved little else other than to consider options for its own future in due course.</p><p>Council leader <a href="https://www.torbay.gov.uk/DemocraticServices/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=136">Dave Thomas</a> acknowledged that while Torbay Council is already a unitary authority, it would be too small to keep this status under the new system, and said it would be better if all Devon’s councils worked together to agree a way forward, preferably using a shared evidence base rather than making competing factual claims.</p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g_J233y-79Q" style="aspect-ratio:16/9"></iframe><p class="caption">Plymouth City Council meeting, 9 January 2025</p><p>Cornwall, however, has an altogether different outcome for the peninsula in mind.</p><p>Two of its Labour MPs returned from a December meeting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Rayner">Angela Rayner</a> held to discuss a non-mayoral Cornwall-only devolution deal with <a href="https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/documents/s184692/Devolution%20for%20Cornwall%20-%20Appendix%201.pdf">the message</a> that Cornwall could either “engage early in the process for a combined authority and a mayor” or “remain on the foundation level” from where it could “campaign for a Cornwall-only footprint” but with “no guarantees”.</p><p>However both of them, along with Cornwall’s four other MPs, had only just endorsed a <a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Devolution-for-Cornwall-V3-final.pdf">report by the University of Exeter Cornish Democracy Unit</a> backing a devolved Cornish assembly similar to those in Wales and Scotland. The report also proposes a separate police force and a Minister for Cornwall supported by a dedicated civil service.</p><p>They’re not alone. The proportion of Cornwall’s residents that identify their national identity as Cornish is rising, to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/articles/cornishidentityenglandandwales/census2021">nearly a fifth at the last census</a>, while a recent <a href="https://www.cornwallchamber.co.uk/">Cornwall Chamber of Commerce</a> survey found majority support among businesses for a bespoke Cornwall-only devolution deal.</p><p>When <a href="https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=584&amp;MId=13372">Cornwall Council met last week</a> it <a href="https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/documents/s184691/Devolution%20for%20Cornwall%20-%20Report.pdf">emphatically backed a motion</a> reaffirming its desire for a non-mayoral Cornwall-only devolution deal which “properly reflects Cornwall’s national identity and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cornish-granted-minority-status-within-the-uk">national minority status of the Cornish</a>”. The motion also confirmed that councillors “will not countenance any cross-border combined authority deals”.</p><p>The mood is febrile. On the day the meeting took place the Conservative administration lost control of the council after <a href="https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=5071">one of its councillors</a> defected and Labour MP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Gelderd">Anna Gelderd</a> broke ranks with her party colleagues to say that Cornwall should explore all devolution options instead of refusing to communicate with councils in Devon.</p><p>All 87 Cornwall Council seats are up for election in May, whether or not Devon County Council elections take place. A decisive vote in favour of increased Cornish autonomy, likely to be a central campaign issue, would render its current position definitive.</p><div class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="peninsula-constituencies---areas-populations--densities">Peninsula constituencies - areas, populations &amp; densities</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Constituency</th><th>County</th><th style="text-align:right">Population</th><th style="text-align:right">Square miles</th><th style="text-align:right">Population/square mile</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Camborne &amp; Redruth LAB</td><td>Cornwall</td><td style="text-align:right">100,254</td><td style="text-align:right">104</td><td style="text-align:right">962</td></tr><tr><td>Central Devon CON</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">94,481</td><td style="text-align:right">531</td><td style="text-align:right">178</td></tr><tr><td>Exeter LAB</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">104,747</td><td style="text-align:right">13</td><td style="text-align:right">8,026</td></tr><tr><td>Exmouth &amp; Exeter East CON</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">103,940</td><td style="text-align:right">95</td><td style="text-align:right">1,099</td></tr><tr><td>Honiton &amp; Sidmouth LIBDEM</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">92,665</td><td style="text-align:right">250</td><td style="text-align:right">370</td></tr><tr><td>Newton Abbot LIBDEM</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">93,888</td><td style="text-align:right">76</td><td style="text-align:right">1,234</td></tr><tr><td>North Cornwall LIBDEM</td><td>Cornwall</td><td style="text-align:right">99,822</td><td style="text-align:right">494</td><td style="text-align:right">202</td></tr><tr><td>North Devon LIBDEM</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">100,505</td><td style="text-align:right">419</td><td style="text-align:right">240</td></tr><tr><td>Plymouth Moor View LAB</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">100,876</td><td style="text-align:right">13</td><td style="text-align:right">7,822</td></tr><tr><td>Plymouth Sutton &amp; Devonport LAB</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">109,322</td><td style="text-align:right">8</td><td style="text-align:right">13,948</td></tr><tr><td>South Devon LIBDEM</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">91,318</td><td style="text-align:right">245</td><td style="text-align:right">372</td></tr><tr><td>South East Cornwall LIBDEM</td><td>Cornwall</td><td style="text-align:right">92,166</td><td style="text-align:right">274</td><td style="text-align:right">337</td></tr><tr><td>South West Devon CON</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">97,848</td><td style="text-align:right">152</td><td style="text-align:right">643</td></tr><tr><td>St Austell &amp; Newquay LAB</td><td>Cornwall</td><td style="text-align:right">100,170</td><td style="text-align:right">114</td><td style="text-align:right">882</td></tr><tr><td>St Ives LIBDEM</td><td>Cornwall</td><td style="text-align:right">89,172</td><td style="text-align:right">223</td><td style="text-align:right">400</td></tr><tr><td>Tiverton &amp; Minehead LIBDEM</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">92,152</td><td style="text-align:right">494</td><td style="text-align:right">186</td></tr><tr><td>Torbay LIBDEM</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">104,303</td><td style="text-align:right">14</td><td style="text-align:right">7,442</td></tr><tr><td>Torridge &amp; Tavistock CON</td><td>Devon</td><td style="text-align:right">96,538</td><td style="text-align:right">630</td><td style="text-align:right">153</td></tr><tr><td>Truro &amp; Falmouth LAB</td><td>Cornwall</td><td style="text-align:right">96,110</td><td style="text-align:right">167</td><td style="text-align:right">575</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Source: <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/constituency-dashboard/">House of Commons Library</a></p></div><p class="dropcap">So we have Devon County Council, Torbay Council, Plymouth City Council and most of Devon’s districts, including Exeter City Council, supporting a peninsula-wide mayoral strategic authority.</p><p>Crucially, however, Cornwall Council – and all bar one of Cornwall’s six MPs – is set against this outcome, a position which might well be strengthened by a May local elections mandate.</p><p>What are the chances of the government agreeing bespoke, separate devolution deals for Devon and Cornwall that fail to comply with just about all the criteria set out in the white paper?</p><p>Even if Plymouth joined the Devon &amp; Torbay Combined County Authority, <a href="https://www.torbay.gov.uk/DemocraticServices/documents/s155857/English%20Devolution%20White%20Paper.pdf">as provided for in the regulations passing through parliament</a>, the government has ruled out the Devon-wide foundation strategic authority it would become under the new system becoming, in turn, a mayoral strategic authority.

If the most recent elections in each district are anything to go by, Labour would come a distant fourth across the board in its inaugural elections behind the East Devon Independents.</p><div class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="peninsula-councils---election-votes-by-political-party">Peninsula councils - election votes by political party</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Council</th><th>Last held</th><th style="text-align:right">CON</th><th style="text-align:right">GRN</th><th style="text-align:right">LAB</th><th style="text-align:right">LIBDEM</th><th style="text-align:right">IND</th><th style="text-align:right">OTHERS</th><th style="text-align:right">Next due</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>East Devon</td><td>2023</td><td style="text-align:right">27,980</td><td style="text-align:right">3,898</td><td style="text-align:right">4,698</td><td style="text-align:right">23,378</td><td style="text-align:right">20,854</td><td style="text-align:right">591</td><td style="text-align:right">2027</td></tr><tr><td>Exeter</td><td>2024</td><td style="text-align:right">5,945</td><td style="text-align:right">6,573</td><td style="text-align:right">12,273</td><td style="text-align:right">3,323</td><td style="text-align:right">4,082</td><td style="text-align:right">0</td><td style="text-align:right">2026</td></tr><tr><td>Mid Devon</td><td>2023</td><td style="text-align:right">13,811</td><td style="text-align:right">2,793</td><td style="text-align:right">2,212</td><td style="text-align:right">19,451</td><td style="text-align:right">3,286</td><td style="text-align:right">19</td><td style="text-align:right">2027</td></tr><tr><td>North Devon</td><td>2023</td><td style="text-align:right">8,041</td><td style="text-align:right">6,508</td><td style="text-align:right">3,003</td><td style="text-align:right">17,501</td><td style="text-align:right">8,158</td><td style="text-align:right">15</td><td style="text-align:right">2027</td></tr><tr><td>South Hams</td><td>2023</td><td style="text-align:right">14,359</td><td style="text-align:right">5,733</td><td style="text-align:right">3,521</td><td style="text-align:right">19,931</td><td style="text-align:right">2,299</td><td style="text-align:right">277</td><td style="text-align:right">2027</td></tr><tr><td>Teignbridge</td><td>2023</td><td style="text-align:right">16,819</td><td style="text-align:right">4,416</td><td style="text-align:right">4,658</td><td style="text-align:right">28,005</td><td style="text-align:right">18,116</td><td style="text-align:right">721</td><td style="text-align:right">2027</td></tr><tr><td>Torridge</td><td>2023</td><td style="text-align:right">8,297</td><td style="text-align:right">3,515</td><td style="text-align:right">2,157</td><td style="text-align:right">7,885</td><td style="text-align:right">11,236</td><td style="text-align:right">536</td><td style="text-align:right">2027</td></tr><tr><td>West Devon</td><td>2023</td><td style="text-align:right">9,829</td><td style="text-align:right">4,318</td><td style="text-align:right">1,024</td><td style="text-align:right">2,626</td><td style="text-align:right">6,897</td><td style="text-align:right">130</td><td style="text-align:right">2027</td></tr><tr><td>Devon</td><td>2021</td><td style="text-align:right">108,702</td><td style="text-align:right">28,285</td><td style="text-align:right">40,640</td><td style="text-align:right">45,395</td><td style="text-align:right">21,962</td><td style="text-align:right">9,157</td><td style="text-align:right">2025</td></tr><tr><td>Plymouth</td><td>2024</td><td style="text-align:right">14,617</td><td style="text-align:right">5,620</td><td style="text-align:right">26,719</td><td style="text-align:right">3,364</td><td style="text-align:right">3,428</td><td style="text-align:right">7,491</td><td style="text-align:right">2026</td></tr><tr><td>Torbay</td><td>2023</td><td style="text-align:right">30,891</td><td style="text-align:right">5,751</td><td style="text-align:right">1,422</td><td style="text-align:right">25,615</td><td style="text-align:right">5,962</td><td style="text-align:right">436</td><td style="text-align:right">2027</td></tr><tr><td>Cornwall</td><td>2021</td><td style="text-align:right">63,851</td><td style="text-align:right">15,748</td><td style="text-align:right">18,985</td><td style="text-align:right">31,201</td><td style="text-align:right">27,462</td><td style="text-align:right">11,529</td><td style="text-align:right">2025</td></tr></tbody><tfoot><tr><td>Totals</td><td></td><td style="text-align:right">323,142</td><td style="text-align:right">93,158</td><td style="text-align:right">121,312</td><td style="text-align:right">227,675</td><td style="text-align:right">133,742</td><td style="text-align:right">30,902</td><td></td></tr></tfoot></table><p>Sources: each local authority.

Just adding Tavistock, Ivybridge and new town <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherford_(new_town)">Sherford</a>, which is is expected to have more than 12,000 residents when complete, to its 269,000 residents gets it comfortably over the 300,000 mark with Labour still in control.</p><p>But were the government to allow Plymouth to expand like this, as well as approving some form of limited geographic Exeter expansion that the local Labour leadership thinks would keep them within a shout of electoral viability, enormous tracts of Devon land would be left unaccounted for, stretching from Ilfracombe to Salcombe and from Holsworthy to Axminster.</p><p>And apart from the gerrymandering being visible from space, the government would soon be faced with dozens of similar small and medium-sized towns and cities pleading the same case elsewhere.</p><p>Could two more Devon unitaries also be created, one centred on Torbay to take in the rest of South Hams and some or most of Teignbridge, the other centred on Barnstaple and covering North Devon, Torridge and the rest of West Devon?</p><p>Perhaps, but it’s not clear whether either unitary would have the tax-raising potential and delivery capacity to make things work, and there would be a real risk of the county being divided into two economic status tiers: wealthier and essentially urban, poorer and essentially rural and coastal.</p><p>So the twin unitary proposals favoured by all the district councils except Exeter look the most coherent, not least because it appears that the best way to address Exeter and Plymouth’s lack of rural services delivery experience is to merge both with rural councils so that each council type contributes more or less equitably to what would be substantially extended capacities for both.</p><p>This way a North Devon unitary with Exeter at its heart and a South Devon unitary with Plymouth at its heart would also each end up with councillors who understand rural residents’ needs balancing councillors who understand the needs of the cities.</p><div class="breakoutbox"><h3 id="peninsula-councils---current-seats-by-political-party">Peninsula councils - current

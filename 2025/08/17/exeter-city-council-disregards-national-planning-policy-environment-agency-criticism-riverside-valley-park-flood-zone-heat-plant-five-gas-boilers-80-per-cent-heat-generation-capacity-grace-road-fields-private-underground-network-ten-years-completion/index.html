When the heat network was announced, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sewer-power-to-heat-homes-and-businesses-and-help-keep-bills-low-after-government-backing">government</a>, the <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/exeter-awarded-more-than-40m-for-new-green-heating-network/">council</a> and the government’s <a href="https://tp-heatnetworks.org/funded-projects/">funding scheme partner</a> all said it would use “the UK’s largest high-temperature water source heat pump”.</p><p>An <a href="unpublished-grace-road-fields-sale-executive-july-2024-officer-report.pdf">unpublished report</a> to <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=55709&amp;PlanId=296&amp;RPID=197451356">last July’s Exeter City Council executive meeting</a> also confirmed that the funding had been awarded “to provide a green heating network utilising water source heat pumps drawing water and heat from the River Exe” and a public exhibition launched by the company two days later <a href="exeter-energy-exhibition-july-2024-display-boards.pdf">repeatedly promoted the River Exe as the key to the scheme</a>.</p><p>The July exhibition also said that the plant’s developer “intended” to rely on other heat sources such as air source heat pumps, an on-site data centre and “in the future potentially using waste heat from other nearby industries”, referring to the adjacent Marsh Barton waste incinerator, <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s97276/1063%20v1.1%20Exeters%20greenhouse%20gas%20reporting%202024%20DRAFT.pdf">Exeter’s largest single source of carbon emissions</a>.</p><p>“Back-up” gas boilers were also mentioned, as was the council’s nearby 1.2MW <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_system">photovoltaic array</a> in Water Lane despite it only being capable, in optimal conditions, of producing a fraction of the plant’s electricity needs.</p><p>Then, in December, Exeter Energy submitted an initial application to the council for <a href="https://publicaccess.exeter.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=SOYFIPHBL1C00">outline planning permission</a> to construct the plant. The <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/K1TDZqQBseqId80YTurVgEmqjJ2M0Pjh/2/895798/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">Design and Access Statement</a> included in the <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/permissions-and-applications/related-documents/?appref=24/1536/OUT">application documents</a> didn’t mention the River Exe. Instead it said: “The primary source of heat generation will be from the air source heat pumps”.</p><p>In February the company confirmed it intended to rely solely on air source heat pumps, alongside gas boilers, in the first phase of the project, which it said would be complete by 2030.</p><p>It said that the project’s second phase would run from 2030 to 2035, when a “significant waste heat source” would be “available” from the adjacent Marsh Barton incinerator, adding: “We believe a connection is possible in 2030, subject to agreeing the contract and the construction timetable”.</p><p>It also mentioned the possibility of extracting waste heat from an on-site data centre sometime before 2035 but could not, when asked, provide examples of data centres elsewhere in the UK that are located in flood zone three. It said it did not have “the necessary information” to do so.</p><p>The company said the third phase of the project would begin in 2036 when it might consider other potential energy sources for the heat plant, if the heat network grew, including electric and hydrogen boilers, geothermal and solar thermal technology – and a water source heat pump.</p><p>A Green Heat Network Fund spokesperson subsequently confirmed that the government grant was “not conditional on the inclusion of a River Exeter water source heat pump” and that the project had been awarded funding for its initial air source heat pump phase alone.</p><p>The spokesperson also confirmed that the prospective use of waste heat from Marsh Barton incinerator and an on-site data centre, also repeatedly promoted by Exeter Energy, were only “potential” connections that might take place in later project development phases.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="exeter-energy-heat-plant-indicative-render-north-elevation.avif" alt="Exeter Energy heat plant indicative render north elevation" width="800" height="450"> Exeter Energy heat plant indicative render north elevation.

Back-up diesel generators were also included to provide the plant with electricity during power cuts.</p><p>None of the previously-pitched data centre, water source heat pump or Water Lane solar array power supply were included in the application, and an incinerator connection was still only presented as a possibility. However detail on the proposed gas boilers was, for the first time, provided in an <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KJrVuze244p4ZhnDnsj/2/915952/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">accompanying report</a>.</p><p>It said there would be five of these, each providing 10.426<a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Megawatts_thermal">MWth</a> for a “total net thermal input capacity of the site of 52.13 MWth”. No more than four would operate at one time, with one serving as a backup, alongside a total of 10MWth provided by air source heat pumps.</p><p>The report added: “In the first few years of operation, it is expected that electrical power to the energy centre will be restricted due to a lack of upstream capacity. This will limit the operational capacity of the ASHP [Air Source Heat Pump] and therefore the boilers will be used for a higher proportion of the heating demand in this time.”</p><p>Never mind that electricity grid constraints in Exeter have <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2024/09/25/exeter-city-council-royal-albert-memorial-museum-riverside-leisure-centre-decarbonisation-scheme-scrapped/">already stopped</a> several <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2025/06/23/exeter-city-council-fields-false-prospectus-in-determination-to-close-northbrook-pool-ian-collinson-reports-double-down-misrepresentation-material-omission-flat-denial-council-plans-to-rend-more-of-city-fabric-from-its-roots/">decarbonisation projects</a> in their tracks, or that the government’s current target to clean up the electricity supply mix still only aims at <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10182/">95% fossil fuel-free sources by 2030</a>. Exeter Energy still calls its heat network “<a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s100259/Handout%201Energy.pdf">low-to-zero carbon</a>”.</p><p>The <a href="https://1energy.uk/networks/exeter-energy-network/">company also makes much of its claim</a> that it will save “over 13,000 tonnes of carbon emissions a year”, <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KNUimSKR4cT6u018dEXjNT0o7/2/911206/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">even though it admits</a> that the plant is only “anticipated to achieve an annual reduction of 13,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions at full build-out of the base-case scenario” – which it doesn’t expect until 2035.</p><p>It doesn’t acknowledge that 13,000<a href="https://www.iema.net/media/xmgpoopk/2022_iema_greenhouse_gas_guidance_eia.pdf">tCO2e</a> is only around <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/07/13/exeter-greenhouse-gas-report-disregards-hundreds-of-thousands-of-tonnes-of-annual-city-emissions-net-zero-failure/">1% of Exeter’s estimated carbon footprint</a>, or that the adjacent incinerator is alone largely responsible for the annual <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s84586/Exeter%20GHG%20inventory%20sector%20monitoring%20report%20first%20draft.pdf">33,500tCO2e of greenhouse gas emissions</a> produced by the city burning waste that would otherwise go to landfill.</p><p>Other claims it makes for the benefits of the project are missing essential context, too. Apart from variations in the total project cost, which it says will be worth “£100m+” in one place, “£110m” in another and “£120m” in a third, it presents this money as an “investment into the city” even though it <a href="exeter-energy-exhibition-july-2024-display-boards.pdf">also says</a> that only around 70% of the total will be spent across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_England">South West region</a> and only “£1.7m of work is committed to businesses in Exeter”.</p><p>And while its claim that 90 people will be employed during plant construction and another 60 in installing the distribution network could be true, it also says that the project will create only four “new high-quality technical jobs” to run the plant <a href="exeter-energy-exhibition-july-2024-display-boards.pdf">once the network has been built</a>.</p><p>Similarly, while it says it might support as many as ten local apprenticeships, it also says it might end up only supporting four.</p><p>It doesn’t present any more evidence to support any of these claims than it does for the “£3 million per annum of social value benefits” that <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s100259/Handout%201Energy.pdf">it says the project will bring Exeter</a>, or for its statement that the heat network “offers customers the lowest-cost way to decarbonise heat compared to alternatives such as individual building-level ASHP”.</p><p>The company also doesn’t seem to grasp that its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s100259/Handout%201Energy.pdf">claim that a possible future incinerator connection</a> could be part of a “carbon neutral” heat network is not only inconsistent with reality – energy generated by combustion is the world’s principal source of greenhouse gas emissions – it is also inconsistent with government policy. All forms of energy from waste are to be excluded by the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clean-power-2030-action-plan/clean-power-2030-action-plan-a-new-era-of-clean-electricity-technical-annex">Clean Power 2030 Action Plan</a>.</p><p>Nor does it acknowledge that the <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/wasteandrecycling/document/resource-and-waste-management-strategy-for-devon-and-torbay/">incinerator contract expires in 2044</a>, after which the facility will become redundant because its <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s97276/1063%20v1.1%20Exeters%20greenhouse%20gas%20reporting%202024%20DRAFT.pdf">colossal emissions</a> are incompatible with a low carbon future.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="liveable-exeter-vision-for-a-transformational-housing-delivery-programme-february-2019.avif" alt="Liveable Exeter Vision for a Transformational Housing Delivery Programme Water Lane redevelopment details, February 2019" width="800" height="518"> <a class="imagelink" aria-label="view image source document" href="liveable-exeter-vision-for-a-transformational-housing-delivery-programme-february-2019.pdf"></a> <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s68381/Liveable%20Exeter%20-%20A%20Transformational%20Housing%20Delivery%20Programme.pdf">Liveable Exeter Vision for a Transformational Housing Delivery Programme</a> Water Lane redevelopment layout map, February 2019</p><p>The Exeter Energy project nevertheless does have one real advantage: that the council has bent over backwards to accommodate a heat plant in Riverside Valley Park by changing local planning policy to suit.</p><p>Grace Road Fields is designated as a recreation ground in the <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/current-policy/approved-masterplans/riverside-and-ludwell-valley-parks-masterplan-2016/">Riverside &amp; Ludwell Valley Parks Masterplan</a>, a <a href="https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-203-2746">supplementary planning document</a> that forms part of the local development framework under the current <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/exeter-local-plan/">Exeter Local Plan</a>.</p><p>It was adopted nine years ago, but the council said as recently as 2021 that it was needed because of the impact of Exeter’s growing population on the Exe Estuary, which must be mitigated by law.</p><p>It said: “One of the elements of the mitigation strategy is the enhancement of alternative natural green space, and the council has identified these two parks for this purpose,” adding that the valley parks masterplan “sets out where new areas of public recreational space can be created, and where improvements to existing space can be made.”</p><p>Three years after agreeing the masterplan, the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=45692">council adopted</a> its “Liveable Exeter Vision for a Transformational Housing Delivery Programme”.</p><p>The <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s68381/Liveable%20Exeter%20-%20A%20Transformational%20Housing%20Delivery%20Programme.pdf">accompanying strategic document</a> identified several development sites, among which was the development site in Water Lane. It showed this as an extension of the existing Water Lane regeneration area further north towards Haven Road – but not further south to Grace Road Fields.</p><p>However, in July last year, the council’s executive committee <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=61181">decided that it should adopt</a> a new <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/current-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-and-planning-statements/liveable-water-lane-supplementary-planning-document-2024/">Water Lane Supplementary Planning Document</a> which has since been a material consideration in the determination of planning applications.</p><p>It extended the Water Lane development site to include Grace Road Fields, adding a <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/4nylmkn3/liveable-water-lane-spd-web.pdf">policy setting out its potential uses</a>. This begins by saying that any proposals for Grace Road Fields “should be developed in collaboration with the council and other stakeholders including <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/topics/sport-england/">Sport England</a> to ensure a comprehensive strategy for the future use of the site”.</p><p>It also says proposals should prioritise enhancing nature and biodiversity, establishing the area as a “regional destination for recreation and water-related activities” and improving recreational opportunities, access to the canal and walking and cycling connections between Marsh Barton, the station and the valley park.</p><p>But despite its emphasis on the wildlife and nature importance of Grace Road Fields, the new policy slipped in that Grace Road Fields would also be an “energy opportunity site”.</p><p>Until recently, the council listed the Riverside and Ludwell Valley Parks Masterplan alongside the <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/current-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-and-planning-statements/">other SPDs which amplify the policies in the current Exeter Local Plan</a>.</p><p>However it <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/current-planning-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-and-planning-statements/riverside-ludwell-valley-parks-masterplan/">removed the masterplan and its accompanying explanatory statement from this list</a> in May – the week after Exeter Energy submitted the final version of its outline planning application for Grace Road Fields – and replaced it with a <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/current-policy/approved-masterplans/riverside-and-ludwell-valley-parks-masterplan-2016/">different description</a> that downgrades it to providing no more than a “vision”.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" class="imageborder" src="water-lane-spd-regulating-plan-july-2024.avif" alt="Water Lane Supplementary Planning Document regulating plan, July 2024" width="800" height="543"> <a class="imagelink" aria-label="view image source document" href="water-lane-spd-regulating-plan-july-2024.pdf"></a> <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/current-policy/supplementary-planning-documents-and-planning-statements/liveable-water-lane-supplementary-planning-document-2024/">Water Lane Supplementary Planning Document</a> regulating plan, July 2024</p><p class="dropcap">Fiddling with local planning policy to support industrial development in the supposedly-protected Riverside Valley Park is one thing, even though it hardly reflects the environmental leadership claims in which the council likes to indulge.</p><p>Disregarding <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-and-coastal-change">national planning policy guidance</a>, which has the <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2025/32.html">same legal status</a> as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Planning_Policy_Framework">National Planning Policy Framework</a> in planning decision-making, is another.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-and-coastal-change#the-sequential-approach-to-the-location-of-development">sequential approach to the location of development</a> laid out in this guidance says it is “designed to ensure that areas at little or no risk of flooding from any source are developed in preference to areas at higher risk” which means “avoiding, so far as possible, development in current and future medium and high flood risk areas”.</p><p>It adds: “Even where a flood risk assessment shows the development can be made safe throughout its lifetime without increasing risk elsewhere, the sequential test still needs to be satisfied”.</p><p>How does the sequential test work? The guidance says: “Where it is not possible to locate development in low-risk areas, the sequential test should go on to compare reasonably available sites within medium risk areas; and then, only where there are no reasonably available sites in low and medium risk areas, within high-risk areas.”</p><p>It says that “reasonably available sites” are those “in a suitable location for the type of development with a reasonable prospect that the site is available to be developed at the point in time envisaged for the development”.</p><p>It adds that these “could include a series of smaller sites and/or part of a larger site if these would be capable of accommodating the proposed development”, and that “such lower-risk sites do not need to be owned by the applicant to be considered ‘reasonably available’”.</p><p>The local planning authority, in this case Exeter City Council, is responsible for ensuring the sequential test has been properly followed in determining applications for development.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="exeter-energy-heat-plant-site-flood-zone-location.avif" alt="Exeter Energy heat plant site flood zone location map" width="800" height="560"> Exeter Energy heat plant site flood zone location.

In other cases, it may be identified from other plan policies.”</p><p>It then says that Grace Road Fields has been “identified” as “suitable for an energy centre” in the Water Lane SPD, and that it is “also part of a wider site allocation within the emerging Exeter Local Plan for mixed use development and indicated as a potential heat network zone”.</p><p>Apart from the <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/emerging-planning-policy/the-new-local-plan-the-exeter-plan/publication-draft-exeter-plan-winter-2024-25/">as-yet unadopted draft of the new Exeter Local Plan</a> having little weight in planning decision-making, <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/qujb120i/policies-map.pdf">Grace Road Fields is not included in the areas</a> which are the target of the new plan’s local energy network strategic policy CC3.</p><p>And while Grace Road Fields is – bizarrely – included in the <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/eothkees/exeter-plan-publication-plan-regulation-19.pdf">draft of the new local plan</a> as mixed use brownfield development site allocation SBA1, this policy only requires an energy strategy for the wider development site and is silent on the construction of new industrial infrastructure in the valley park – although it does have much to say about enhancement of the natural environment there.</p><p>The <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/4nylmkn3/liveable-water-lane-spd-web.pdf">Water Lane SPD</a> is similarly non-committal on an energy strategy for the proposed brownfield development, although the <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=62166">approved</a> but <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/planning-services/permissions-and-applications/related-documents/?appref=23/1007/OUT">not yet consented</a> outline <a href="https://publicaccess.exeter.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&amp;keyVal=RZ803JHB00E00">planning permission</a> for the <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KbtuwSl7vp1Wh5PgHPsxcYF/2/837669/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">Water Lane development site proper</a> includes <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/s97673/Item%205%20-%2023-1007-OUT%20Committee%20Report.pdf">provisions for the development’s own air source heat pump-powered energy centre</a>.</p><p>The sequential test planning note also includes a map of the proposed Exeter Energy heat network route.

All are summarily dismissed as too small.</p><p>The other sixteen locations are assessed as if the Exeter Energy planning application does include connections to a River Exe water source heat pump and Marsh Barton incinerator, thus enabling the instant rejection of almost all of them on the grounds they are too far from either one or both.</p><p>The rest are similarly dismissed in an exercise characterised by unevidenced assertions and an absence of comparative analysis, in particular of flood risk.</p><p>What is even more remarkable about this assessment is that none of the potential energy centre sites identified by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero in its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6839ad1bc99c4f37ab4e8705/exeter-zone-opportunity-report.pdf">Exeter Heat Network Zoning report</a> are included in the assessment, even though the report confirms that its authors were in close contact with Exeter Energy about the company’s plans during its production.</p><p>In this report, one of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heat-network-zone-opportunity-reports">28 similar studies of places across the country</a>, the government identifies five strategic heat network zones in Exeter using its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/heat-network-zoning">standardised methodology</a>. One covers Sowton, another the proposed new town in East Devon between the A30 and A3052 south of Exeter Airport.</p><p>The other three networks cover Wonford, the city centre and the university. The study identifies suitable brownfield land on which to locate air source heat pump-powered heat plants for each network: on the hospital estate, on the council-owned Magdalen Road car park and on the university’s Streatham campus. <a href="https://flood-map-for-planning.service.gov.uk/map?seg=fz&amp;cz=292262.3%2C92896.1%2C15">None of these locations</a> are at risk of flooding.</p><p>It goes on to say that it identified the three strategic heat network zones separately as they “did not meet a sufficient level of linear heat density when combined”, but adds that “more localised detailed design work has proved that it is possible to combine the areas into a single larger network”, which is the proposal being pursued by Exeter Energy Network, spanning all three.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="grace-road-fields-march-2025.avif" alt="Grace Road Fields in March" width="800" height="450"> Grace Road Fields in March</p><p>There is no explanation for the absence of these potential heat plant sites in the application’s sequential test planning note, nor of why a distributed network with heat pumps on all three sites would not be a more efficient and resilient design which would avoid harming Riverside Valley Park.</p><p>Instead, Exeter Energy’s planning consultants cite a <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2024/279.html">High Court judgement</a> which they say clarifies the importance of “flexibility” in applying the test “even if it is considered that the sequential test is failed”.</p><p>In citing this judgement, apparently as an insurance policy against the risk the application does fail their sequential test, they don’t explain in what way such “flexibility” might be of relevance.</p><p>In it, the judge examines the interpretation and application of the sequential test. He says: “The policy to steer new development to areas with the lowest risk of flooding would be defeated if any examination of alternative sites is restricted by inflexible requirements set by developers.</p><p>“But a broad, non-specific approach by planning authorities to sequential assessments which generally disregards development requirements could lead to inappropriate business decisions being imposed on developers or the market. There is a need for realism and flexibility on all sides.”</p><p>He also cites a <a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/13.html">Supreme Court judgement</a> that national planning policy guidance seeks to address this “inbuilt difficulty” in the sequential test by advising that developers have regard to the particular contextual circumstances when preparing their proposals “as regards the format, design and scale of the development”.</p><p>It continues: “As part of such an approach, they are expected to consider the scope for accommodating the proposed development in a different built form, and where appropriate adjusting or sub-dividing large proposals, in order that their scale may fit better with existing development.”</p><p>Neither judgement says that planning authorities should allow developers to ignore potential alternative heat plant sites that have been identified in government studies, or any others that might enable the proposed development in sub-divided form to address flood risk.</p><p>Nor, of course, do they say planning authorities should base their decisions on anything other than the information contained in each planning application and any material considerations that pertain, per <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/determining-a-planning-application#how-decisions-on-applications">national planning policy guidance on decision-making</a>.</p><p>Nor do they say that developers who make speculative future business development claims about their planning applications are not required to provide substantiating evidence as part of those applications which demonstrates the credibility of those claims and the degree of certainty that they might one day be delivered.</p><p>The “flexibility” that is necessary to avoid the “inbuilt difficulty” in the sequential test does not mean planning authorities should simply ignore reasonably available alternative sites of which all involved are aware, or ignore the scope for delivering the proposed development across several sites to remove flood risk, or make decisions based on unsubstantiated claims about future business development plans that are not part of planning applications without any evidence to support them.</p><p>On the contrary, a range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice">High Court</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_(England_and_Wales)">Court of Appeal</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom">Supreme Court</a> judgements confirm the importance of <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/567.html">realistic</a> and <a href="https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2020/3.html">rational</a> assessment of proposed development in planning decision-making that should be based on <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/1346.html">transparent, proper reasoning</a> and <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2001/74.html">clear evidence</a> that is <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/1370.html">relevant and up-to-date</a>, including when it comes to <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/734.html">speculative future claims</a> about that development.</p><p>When Exeter Energy’s planning consultants say building a heat plant “close to the river and the energy recovery facility building” presents an “opportunity for connection along with the opportunity to use water source heat pumps and connection to the River Exe at a later date” they are correct.</p><p>But Exeter Energy’s planning application does not include any evidence that these speculative future connections will ever be delivered, so it should not be decided by relying on them any more than a local planning authority should accept a sequential test which ignores reasonably available alternative development sites that are not at flood risk at all.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="exeter-energy-heat-plant-site-masterplan.avif" alt="Exeter Energy heat plant site masterplan" width="800" height="800"> <a class="lightboxlink" aria-label="view image in lightbox" href="exeter-energy-heat-plant-site-masterplan-lightbox.avif"></a> Exeter Energy heat plant site masterplan.

It said it “includes references to the potential future water source/heat source options that are not part of the current application. We consider that these references, while noted, are not relevant to the assessment of this application and should not influence the sequential test conclusions”.</p><p>It continued: “We consider that the sequential test does not clearly or comprehensively present all the flood risks associated with the alternative sites. In particular, it lacks detail on surface water flood risks, which is a critical consideration. The assessment should go beyond a basic comparison of flood zone classifications and, instead, utilise the best available flood risk data, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Flood_Risk_Assessment">Strategic Flood Risk Assessment</a> outputs where applicable.”</p><p>It concluded: “We recommend that the sequential test should be revised to include a more detailed and transparent comparison of flood risks across all considered sites, incorporating surface water flood risk and Strategic Flood Risk Assessment data.

It simply concludes that this half of the exception test is satisfied on the grounds that the development would be safe for its lifetime (50-100 years according to Exeter Energy) in flood risk terms without increasing flood risk elsewhere.</p><p>It then considers whether the other half of the exception test is also satisfied: that the development would provide wider sustainability benefits that outweigh the residual flood risk.</p><p>It takes these to be “facilitation of a heat supply to a proposed district heating network” providing a “route to zero carbon heat” and “improvements to air quality”, the “provision of education and economic benefits” and the “enhancement of retained open space for recreation and biodiversity”.</p><p>The report nearly manages to avoid repeating Exeter Energy’s headline emissions reduction claim, for which the application provides no evidence.</p><p>It nevertheless admits that the “carbon savings of 13,000 tonnes annually” are only “estimated by the applicant” as a end-result of “supplying heat to networked sites including the Wonford and Heavitree Road hospital sites, Exeter College, the university’s Streatham and St Luke’s campuses, the Water Lane regeneration area and other sites located along the connecting network corridors”.</p><p>Of course, neither the distribution network nor any prospective supply agreements nor studies demonstrating that the network would yield greater emissions reductions than each of its large, institutional prospective customers installing their own facilities or participating in more localised, distributed heat networks is included in the application.</p><p>Nor does the report compare the heat plant dependence on gas boilers or the possibility of a connection to the high-emissions waste heat from the adjacent incinerator in five years’ time with the prospect of one or more of these institutions installing its own genuinely low carbon heating systems now.</p><p>Instead, the council apparently simply assumes that a single, citywide network would be both more resilient and more likely to reduce emissions both now and in the future, when it apparently believes that the network will become truly zero carbon even though there is no date for this in sight.</p><p>The report does say that planning consent for the plant could be conditional on the provision of a “carbon reduction plan” to ensure that the “promoted carbon benefits of the development are realised”, that it complies with “legislative targets and local objectives” and it “monitors emissions related to the heat supply”. But no such plan is included with the application, nor any of the parameters it might contain.</p><p>A graph provided by Exeter Energy, after the council report was written, purports to address the lack of evidence included in the application in support of the company’s emissions claims. But all it shows is the division of its projected annual heat demand into two segments.</p><p>It does not quantify the plant’s expected emissions, or compare them with the existing heating-related emissions of the network’s prospective customers, or explain why the plant requires five times as much generation capacity from gas boilers as it does air source heat pumps, or how electricity supply grid limitations, which will prevent it using air source heat pump capacity for several years, will affect its reliance on gas.</p><p>Nor is the graph dated. Does it represent heat demand during the plant’s first year of operation or its tenth year, when it reaches “<a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KNUimSKR4cT6u018dEXjNT0o7/2/911206/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">full build-out of the base-case scenario</a>”?</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" class="imageborder" src="exeter-energy-heat-demand-distribution-graph.avif" alt="Exeter Energy heat demand distribution graph" width="800" height="390"> <a class="lightboxlink" aria-label="view image in lightbox" href="exeter-energy-heat-demand-distribution-graph-lightbox.avif"></a> Exeter Energy heat demand distribution graph.

Exeter Energy has apparently “advised” the council that this will happen and the council seems to have accepted this advice at face value, without any supporting evidence.</p><p>(The company’s claim that four permanent jobs will be created is missing from the report altogether, as are its claims about local investment.)</p><p>When it comes to the impact of constructing the heat plant in a Riverside Valley Park green space, the council report cannot avoid acknowledging “tensions between development plan policies which seek to protect the open space and landscape setting of the city and those which promote some development in the area of this site”.</p><p>It says the Water Lane SPD identifies the site as part of an area for open space uses but also green energy opportunities, so Exeter Energy’s planning application is “considered to accord with the principles of the SPD”.</p><p>But it also admits that the Riverside &amp; Ludwell Valley Parks Masterplan, while “not endorsed for development management purposes”, does carry some – albeit limited – weight in local planning decision-making, and that <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/vmqp3mcg/local-plan-written-statement.pdf">Exeter Local Plan policy EN6</a> only supports renewable energy facilities “provided that the benefits outweigh harms, including to landscape”.</p><p>Grace Road Fields is only a mile from the Exe Estuary, which is a <a href="https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/sites-of-special-scientific-interest-england/explore?location=50.692236%2C-3.498704%2C14.00">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>, a <a href="https://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/3055153">Special Protection Area</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsar_site">Ramsar site</a>.</p><p>But the report finds that the plant will not have “a significant effect on those sensitive sites” even though it will remove several acres of valley park green space immediately alongside the 4,000 or so additional residents who are eventually expected in Water Lane – with another 4,000 subsequently due in the housing that will replace much of the adjacent section of Marsh Barton industrial estate.</p><p>It also finds that, although Grace Road Fields is inside the <a href="https://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/media/6373/sac_and_spa_10km_buffer_-_sept_14.pdf">10km Special Protection Area buffer zone</a>, where housing and tourism development <a href="https://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/planning/biodiversity/exe-estuary-dawlish-warren-habitat-mitigation/joint-approach-to-standard-mitigation-contribution/">must be mitigated</a>, the heat plant is not “expected to result in increased recreational pressure upon the site” because it is neither of these.</p><p>Grace Road Fields is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Nature_Conservation_Interest">Site of Nature Conservation Interest</a>, with a range of species – including protected species – recorded there. <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/media/vmqp3mcg/local-plan-written-statement.pdf">Exeter Local Plan policy LS4</a> is intended to protect such sites, but allows “appropriate compensatory measures” to mitigate identified impacts.</p><p>At Grace Road Fields <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_translocation">species translocation</a> and a <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KBk20KEJ3p7f3Q2BKEEjVx8FMtY/2/916704/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">lighting strategy</a>, to be <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KJfbnOQO2A1nylknI0uAWQFLgqv/2/916703/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">combined with a bat buffer</a>, are “considered sufficient for the proposed development” in this respect.</p><p>Overall, while the report finds that “there will be some impact on the area as a result of this development” it concludes that it “would not be of a scale and nature likely to result in significant environmental effects”.</p><p>It also finds that a proposed <a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KJfbnOQO2A1nylknI0uAWQFLgqv/2/916703/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">Biodiversity Net Gain uplift</a> and “further enhancement of the wider field” – according to purely illustrative “<a href="https://planningdocs.exeter.gov.uk/servlets/direct/KftmtfwTT5JF8IGoeUU18ns/2/914640/1/1/AS_PDF_FILE">concept designs</a>” submitted in support of the application but not as part of it – are sufficient to satisfy any remaining concerns.</p><p>Despite the applicant demonstrating none of the scheme’s claimed benefits, which would be of doubtful significance even if delivered, the report concludes: “None of the adverse impacts, individually or cumulatively, are considered to significantly and demonstrably outweigh the public benefits of the development when assessed against the policies in the National Planning Policy Framework or the local development plan when taken as a whole”.</p><p>The proposals are therefore “considered to constitute sustainable development overall” for which planning permission should be approved.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="phil-bialyk-exeter-labour-green-space-protection.avif" alt="Grace Road Fields in March" width="800" height="450"> Council leader Phil Bialyk announces he is reviewing the decision to sell the green space behind Clifton Hill sports centre for development in July 2019.

Paul Barker tried to evade the question then was rescued by Paul Knott, who said it was future-focussed and had nothing to do with the application in front of the committee.</p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hYH4TG02OA0" style="aspect-ratio:16/9"></iframe><p>Committee member <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=9849">Andy Ketchin</a> raised the sequential test and asked whether Exeter Energy had approached any Marsh Barton landowners to discuss the possibility of acquiring a brownfield site there for the plant.</p><p>Paul Barker said it had not, adding that the company’s agent had only looked at what was being advertised for sale before saying it had discounted Marsh Barton as it was on the wrong side of the railway line to connect to the river or canal in any case.</p><p>Andy Ketchin then asked how much time the council had spent checking whether the claims made in the submitted sequential test were true, and whether it had looked at possible alternative sites for the plant in Marsh Barton. The council <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/council-information/council-data/land-and-building-assets/">owns 65 freeholds on the trading estate alone</a>.</p><p>Council development director <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/contact-us/senior-management-officers/ian-collinson-mrtpi-strategic-director-for-place/">Ian Collinson</a> responded that the question was unreasonable, unfair and that the council didn’t know the answer in any case.</p><p>Andy Ketchin raised the sequential test shortcomings again. He said no compelling reason for constructing the heat plant in Grace Road Fields had been presented and that, in particular, no justification had been provided for the claim that it would be impossible to build the plant on a brownfield site in Marsh Barton industrial estate.</p><p>He added that the evidence that had been provided with the application was flimsy, if there was substantive evidence to support the application it had not been provided and that the decision required real scrutiny of the sequential test.</p><p>Ian Collinson evidently disagreed. He said that that the plant would “strengthen Exeter’s role as a leader in sustainable development and climate action”, and added: “In actual fact, it’s very clear from the officer’s assessment and from the advice of the Environment Agency that it has passed the sequential test”.</p><p><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgMeetingAttendance.aspx?ID=7871">All the committee members</a> except Michael Mitchell and Andy Ketchin voted to approve the application. It was apparent that several believed that the Environment Agency was happy with the plans, while others had taken Exeter Energy’s future business development claims or other matters outside the scope of the application into account in deciding how to vote.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" class="imageborder" src="unpublished-grace-road-fields-sale-executive-july-2024-officer-report.avif" alt="" width="800" height="545"> <a class="imagelink" aria-label="view image source document" href="unpublished-grace-road-fields-sale-executive-july-2024-officer-report.pdf"></a> Unpublished report to July 2024 city council executive meeting.

The <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/consultations-and-petitions/public-open-space-disposal-land-at-grace-road-field/">scant consultation materials it provided</a> failed to mention that Grace Road Fields is part of the Riverside Valley Park, and it didn’t promote the consultation until <a href="https://news.exeter.gov.uk/public-invited-to-comment-on-land-disposal-at-grace-road/">three weeks after it opened</a>.</p><p>When the council approved the sale in principle, it nevertheless <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=60868">formally resolved</a> that the public consultation results would be “presented to executive prior to any exchange on the disposal of the site”.

A resident said the excavations are “not typical street works” but “wide enough and deep enough to drive through”, like “digging a mini channel tunnel through sixteen miles of Exeter”.</p><p>The council executive was also supposed to see a report on the distribution network, framed as covering “the city council’s wider role in enabling the rollout”.

in response to Exeter Energy’s application to build the heat plant in Grace Road Fields, was this: “The laying of any pipework associated with this development could have an impact on all types of traffic (vehicular and non-motorised users) throughout the city and cause delays for all users of the highway network.</p><p>“When considering the size of Exeter city and the potential spread across the city of end users for the heat network, there could be a requirement for a substantial amount of traffic works throughout the city and these works could involve traffic management and or road closures to complete the work.</p><p>“While all these works would not be undertaken at the same time, there may be cases where there are multiple works to take place within the city at the same time, this will still represent a sustained level of roadworks throughout the city for a considerable time.”</p><p>It added: “Whilst this aspect of the planning application does sit outside of the red line of the planning application, it will likely cause there to be disruption within the city of Exeter.</p><p>“There is no information regarding scale of the pipe networks nor what routes this would take and no way to assess the impact at this time.”</p></article></main></div><div><aside><div><aside-heading><span>Share this story</span></aside-heading><ul><li><a class="icon"

Poignant poem tells the story of a rough sleeper in this year's St Petrock's Christmas campaign (photograph)

Exeter's local homelessness charity, St Petrock's, launches its Christmas fundraising campaign today, with a powerful thought-provoking video, filmed from the perspective of someone with no option but to sleep rough.

The film tells a story that is fictionalised, yet very common

Although the account is fictional, trauma and poor mental health are key causes of homelessness among the people St Petrock's supports.

A former client of St Petrock's, who slept on Exeter's streets for six months before being helped into supported accommodation last year, has kindly given up his time to be the face of the video and help with the charity's fundraising.

A poem written by a former rough sleeper is the inspiration behind the film

The inspiration for the film is a poem, Starry Night, written by another former client.  It's voiced by an actor and vividly expresses the sadness and desperation associated with having no option left but to sleep on the streets.

St Petrock's provides essential and life-saving services for people without a home, including breakfasts and lunches, hot drinks, clothes, survival gear, showers, laundry and emotional support. The charity also provides housing for people experiencing homelessness, benefits advice, and works with local organisations to help people rebuild their lives and escape homelessness for good.

Once again, St Petrock's has commissioned local film-makers, AllTold to create an arresting two-minute production.

The film is being advertised across the main social media channels free of charge by local marketing agency One Voice Media to ensure this powerful message reaches as many people as possible.

Peter Stephenson, St Petrock's Chief Executive, explains: "The video, which was filmed by one of the AllTold team in a camera headset, begins under a bridge next to the river. It's dark and raining and our rough sleeper's mind wanders back to the time when his family situation broke down.

Our rough sleeper experiences hostility and violence from passers-by

"As the film progresses, he experiences hostility from passers-by, and even violence, which is tough to watch, but sadly not unusual.

"When he arrives at St Petrock's he is welcomed with kindness by people who care, given a meal, a hot drink and some sturdy new boots. We see his face for the first time."

Mr Stephenson continues: "Our team continues to feel very emotional each time we watch the film as we know how true it rings. The narrative embodies the experience of so many of our clients. A difficult and traumatic past, loss and pain, leading to homelessness with all the risks and hardship associated with sleeping rough."

Visits to St Petrock's by homeless people remain high

St Petrock's continues to see high numbers of visits to its centre in Cathedral Yard, following a doubling of the numbers of rough sleepers on the streets of Exeter two years ago. The number of people sleeping rough in the city currently varies between 25 and 35 on any given night.

Between April and September this year, St Petrock's homelessness team engaged with almost 4,500 homeless or vulnerably housed people. This is a daily average of 17 people via breakfast outreach and 20 people at lunchtime.



Times are increasingly tough for St Petrock's

Mr Stephenson continued: "Like many charities, times are tough for St Petrock's. Unfortunately, grant income and public donations have both faltered in recent months, as people and institutions continue to tighten their belts.

"Our Christmas campaign has become an absolutely essential plank of our fundraising, whilst also hammering the message home that rough sleeping is a million miles away from a lifestyle choice.

"AllTold has yet again, pulled off a wonderfully powerful film and I hope people, while tucking into their festive lunch with loved ones, will spare a thought for those on the streets this Christmas and donate to help support our life-saving work."

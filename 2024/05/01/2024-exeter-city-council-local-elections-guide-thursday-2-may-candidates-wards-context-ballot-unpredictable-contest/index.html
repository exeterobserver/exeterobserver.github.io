Contains Ordnance Survey and National Statistics data © <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Crown copyright and database right</a></p><p class="dropcap">There are 39 seats on Exeter City Council and 90,000 registered voters in the city. Each of thirteen electoral wards of between <a href="https://exeter.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/elections-and-voting/electoral-services/electoral-statistics/">6,300 and 8,000</a> electors is represented by three councillors.</p><p>A third of the seats, one in each ward, is normally contested in each of three consecutive years, with county council elections held in the fourth year. Each city councillor normally serves a four year term.</p><p>Exeter’s wards have been arranged this way since <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/65/made">boundary changes</a> prompted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Exeter_City_Council_election">exceptional election</a> of the whole council at the same time in 2016, when 30 Labour councillors were elected.</p><p>The party had already been in control of the council for four years. It has now been in this position for twelve, making Exeter what the <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/the-cost-of-one-party-councils/">Electoral Reform Society</a> calls a “one party council” with “weak electoral accountability” which greatly increases the likelihood of cronyism, corruption and spending decisions which offer poor value for public money.</p><p>It lost ground at each subsequent election <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2023/05/06/exeter-city-council-2023-local-elections-results/">until last year</a>. But last May’s ballot confirmed that changes in the city’s political landscape that had begun the previous year, including the <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/05/06/greens-take-three-seats-from-labour-so-progressive-group-replaces-conservatives-as-official-opposition/">replacement of the Conservatives as the official opposition</a> by the Progressive Group of Green and Liberal Democrat councillors, with the help of an Independent, were <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2023/05/05/exeter-electoral-tectonic-plates-rumble-political-landscape-shifts-labour-takes-second-conservative-seat-topsham-loses-st-thomas-green-wins-heavitree-st-davids-newtown-st-leonards-place-party-second-2023-city-council-elections/">set to continue</a>.</p><p>The council’s composition then changed again, following last May’s results. Labour enters this ballot fielding just two incumbents. Two of its councillors whose terms come to an end on Thursday have left the party, another has resigned their seat and a fourth has been suspended pending an investigation. Three more are standing down and one has not been reselected.</p><p>As a result the party now holds 22 seats on the council, six of which it is directly defending. It has to win four to stay in control for another two years: the next city council election is scheduled for 2026 with the county council elections taking place next year.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-parliament" data-src="visualisation/17765780"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1880">David Harvey</a> was the first Labour councillor to go in May 2022, since when he has represented Pinhoe as an Independent.

She previously stood for the party in Tiverton &amp; Honiton on a “save our farms” platform. Among other roles, she is doubling up as the party’s returning officer in Exeter this year.</p><p>Her campaign leads on the claim that Labour will refuse to sell a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom_strip">ransom strip</a> of land the council owns between Pendragon Road and the development site, without which the development could not go ahead as no other vehicle access to the site is available.</p><p>However this is rather undermined by the council’s decision to alter the <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/documents/new-exeter-local-plan-full-draft-proposals-map.pdf">city’s urban boundary to include the Pendragon Road fields as a development site</a> long before the appeal hearing took place.</p><p>It has also postponed its decision about the sale of this land, which was <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/documents/l284/Printed%20plan%20January%202024.pdf?T=4">originally supposed to take place in February</a>, to <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=54947&amp;PlanId=284&amp;RPID=16466090">shortly after the local elections will have taken place</a>.</p><p>Exeter Independent <a href="https://exeterindependentgroup.org.uk/our-candidates/mincinglake-whipton-ch/">Clive Hutchings</a>, who has recently joined a long line of people who have learned that caution is well-advised when posting on social media, stands ready to benefit from widespread disaffection with Labour in the ward.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/17789756"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><h2 id="open-questions">Open questions</h2><p>Might long-serving ex-Labour councillor <a href="https://exeterindependentgroup.org.uk/our-candidates/st-thomas-rh/">Rob Hannaford</a> also do well as an Exeter Independent in <strong>St Thomas</strong>, where his high profile among local voters could carry him over the line ahead of Labour’s Deborah Darling?

Conservative group leader <a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=6682">Anne Jobson</a>, who is defending her seat in <strong>St Loye’s</strong>, may find out.</p><p>She faces strong competition from Jake Bonetta, who became the first Labour councillor to sit on East Devon District Council for more than twenty years, and also its youngest councillor at the age of nineteen, after winning a 2021 by-election.</p><p>He was also <a href="https://www.honiton.gov.uk/Core/Honiton-Town-Council/UserFiles/Files/ELECTIONS/2021/Honiton%20St%20Michaels%20results.pdf">elected to Honiton Town Council</a> two months earlier, and stood for election to Devon County Council in the same year, when he significantly increased <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/democracy/division2021/feniton-honiton/">the Labour vote share</a>.</p><p>National commentary on this year’s local elections often cites predictions that the Conservatives could lose as many as 500 council seats, around half of those they hold, because most of those being contested were last elected in 2021 when the government was benefiting from the delivery of its pandemic vaccine programme.</p><p>However this shift in public opinion was no more reflected in Exeter’s local elections in 2021 than the increase in national Labour support has been reflected in the two elections that have been held here since, with local issues and changing demographics appearing to be much more influential.</p><p>Exeter’s Conservatives will nevertheless be fearing the loss of both the seats they are defending. If Anne Jobson holds on to hers the local party will have done well, despite being reduced to just three seats in a single ward. It hasn’t held so few in Exeter since 1999.</p><p class="caption"><img loading="lazy" src="2021-devon-and-cornwall-police-and-crime-commissioner-election-results.avif" alt="2021 Devon &amp; Cornwall Police and Crime commissioner election results" width="1405" height="372"> <a class="lightboxlink" href="2021-devon-and-cornwall-police-and-crime-commissioner-election-results.avif"></a> 2021 Devon &amp; Cornwall Police and Crime commissioner election results.<br>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_England_and_Wales_police_and_crime_commissioner_elections#Devon_and_Cornwall_Police">Wikipedia</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License">Creative Commons license</a></p><h2 id="police-and-crime-commissioner">Police and Crime Commissioner</h2><p>Exeter’s electors, alongside those across the rest of Devon and Cornwall, will also be able to cast a vote in the <a href="https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/police-and-crime-commissioner-elections-2024">2024 Devon &amp; Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner election</a> on Thursday.</p><p>Conservative incumbent <a href="https://choosemypcc.org.uk/candidates/devon-and-cornwall/alison-hernandez-2/">Alison Hernandez</a> is standing against <a href="https://choosemypcc.org.uk/candidates/devon-and-cornwall/steve-lodge-2/">Steve Lodge</a> for the Liberal Democrats and <a href="https://choosemypcc.org.uk/candidates/devon-and-cornwall/daniel-john-steel-2/">Daniel Steel</a> for Labour.</p><p>As <a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2024/03/11/whats-up-for-election-in-2024/">only Exeter and Plymouth are also holding council elections this year in Devon and Cornwall</a> – apart from a handful of district by-elections – and both cities have comparatively small Conservative-supporting electorates, some think the opposition candidates may do rather better this year than last time.</p><p>However Alison Hernandez was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_England_and_Wales_police_and_crime_commissioner_elections#Devon_and_Cornwall_Police">only 141 votes short of winning after the first round in 2021</a>, under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_vote#Supplementary_vote">supplementary voting system</a> that has been replaced with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting">first-past-the-post</a> at this year’s elections following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_Act_2022">Elections Act 2022</a>.</p><p>An old political saw applies, as well as the advantages this voting system will confer on her candidacy: never underestimate the Conservative postal vote.</p><div id="dc_wdiv" aria-live="polite" role="region" data-candidates="true" style="margin-top:40px;margin-bottom:40px"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://widget.wheredoivote.co.uk/wdiv.js"></script><h2 id="methodology-note">Methodology note</h2><p>As the 2016 city council elections were held using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_non-transferable_vote">multiple non-transferable vote system</a> each voter was allowed to cast up to three votes which were not ranked in any order of preference.</p><p>Because not all voters cast all three of their votes a precise vote share for individual candidates cannot be derived from the recorded results.</p><p>This also applies to two individual ward elections held since then, in Priory in 2019 and Mincinglake &amp; Whipton in 2021, when voters were invited to cast up to two votes to elect two councillors at the same time, and in Exwick, Heavitree, Pennsylvania and Priory in 2022.</p><p>Calculating comparative party vote shares in Exeter City Council elections over time is further complicated because the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats stood aside for independent candidate Jemima Moore in Newtown &amp; St Leonard’s in 2019, then formed a cross-party alliance which led to them standing aside for each other in a total of six wards across the city in 2021.</p><p>Consequently, a proportional share of the ballots cast for the leading candidate in each party in each ward in which the party stood has been used to compare major party support in the principal city council elections that have taken place since 2016.</p><p>We believe this is the best available method to enable statistically meaningful comparisons between the major parties in the city.

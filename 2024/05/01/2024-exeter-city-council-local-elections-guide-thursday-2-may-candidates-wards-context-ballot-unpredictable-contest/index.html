It has now been in this position for twelve, making Exeter what the <a href="https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/the-cost-of-one-party-councils/">Electoral Reform Society</a> calls a “one party council” with “weak electoral accountability” which greatly increases the likelihood of cronyism, corruption and spending decisions which offer poor value for public money.</p><p>It lost ground at each subsequent election <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2023/05/06/exeter-city-council-2023-local-elections-results/">until last year</a>. But last May’s ballot confirmed that changes in the city’s political landscape that had begun the previous year, including the <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2022/05/06/greens-take-three-seats-from-labour-so-progressive-group-replaces-conservatives-as-official-opposition/">replacement of the Conservatives as the official opposition</a> by the Progressive Group of Green and Liberal Democrat councillors, with the help of an Independent, were <a href="https://exeterobserver.org/2023/05/05/exeter-electoral-tectonic-plates-rumble-political-landscape-shifts-labour-takes-second-conservative-seat-topsham-loses-st-thomas-green-wins-heavitree-st-davids-newtown-st-leonards-place-party-second-2023-city-council-elections/">set to continue</a>.</p><p>The council’s composition then changed again, following last May’s results. Labour enters this ballot fielding just two incumbents. Two of its councillors whose terms come to an end on Thursday have left the party, another has resigned their seat and a fourth has been suspended pending an investigation. Three more are standing down and one has not been reselected.</p><p>As a result the party now holds 22 seats on the council, six of which it is directly defending. It has to win four to stay in control for another two years: the next city council election is scheduled for 2026 with the county council elections taking place next year.</p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-parliament" data-src="visualisation/17765780"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><p><a href="https://committees.exeter.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=1880">David Harvey</a> was the first Labour councillor to go in May 2022, since when he has represented Pinhoe as an Independent.

Mid-year by-elections have been excluded.</p><p>Candidates from other parties, as well as independent candidates, have also stood in each of these elections.</p><p>UKIP contested most, but not all, of the city’s wards in 2016 and again in 2019, but not in 2018. The Women’s Equality Party also contested city council elections in Duryard &amp; St James in 2018, 2019 and 2021. Candidates have also represented other small parties in some years.</p><p>All these smaller parties have been grouped together to simplify comparison. Where more than one non-major party stood in a multiple non-transferable vote election the best performing candidate has been included in the analysis.</p><p>Independent candidates, when they have stood, have been presented separately. In 2019 two stood at the same time and have been presented together.</p></article><hr class="uk-divider-icon"><aside class="prompt"><p><span>Democracy doesn't work when people don't know</span> who is

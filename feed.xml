                        <description>Exeter City Council has allowed property assets to deteriorate while prioritising new schemes including the £44 million St Sidwell's Point leisure centre, forcing it to identify assets for sale to pay its outstanding repair bills.</description>
                    

                    
                        <extract>Maintenance – the property upkeep variety, not post-divorce payments – is seldom glamourous or even interesting. It is readily overlooked by politicians and bureaucrats whose careers are advanced by being seen to innovate. A brand new play facility and its attendant publicity gets more brownie points than the unnoticed activity of preventing an old one from falling apart.

Every so often, however, the past hits the present with an unpleasant surprise, commonly in the form of a whopping bill.

The government has announced that restrictions on door to door campaigning in the run-up to the local elections on 6 May will be relaxed from next week, in step with its planned changes to lockdown rules. The new regulations only apply in England: the devolved administrations are setting out separate plans for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

                        <description>Exeter City Council has responded to an enquiry about disproportionate Church of England representation on the Liveable Exeter Place Board by accusing Exeter Observer of promoting a &amp;quot;partisan narrative&amp;quot; and claiming our public interest reporting &amp;quot;bears no resemblance to fact&amp;quot;.</description>
                    

                    
                        <extract>Exeter City Council established the Liveable Exeter Place Board in 2019 to support the delivery of its “ambitious and visionary” Liveable Exeter programme. At the core of this programme is the aspiration to build 12,000 new homes in such a way that a series of communities are created which include retail and employment options and so reduce the need to travel across the city. It is intended to support the council’s goal of reducing the city’s carbon footprint to net zero by 2030.

Devon County Council is among the UK’s top local authority fossil fuel investors despite the council declaring a climate emergency nearly two years ago and committing to becoming carbon neutral by 2050.

A report examining local authority staff pension fund investments has found that the Devon Local Government Pension Scheme, which is managed by Devon County Council, invests £157 million of its £4 billion fund in fossil fuel companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP, BHP, Anglo American and ExxonMobil.

                        <description>Local councils are investing up to £7.3 million in a £23 million project to supply a development of 2500 homes with heat which depends on the Marsh Barton waste incinerator, Exeter's largest single source of carbon emissions.</description>
                    

                    
                        <extract>

Exeter City Council, Teignbridge District Council and Devon County Council have agreed to help fund a project to supply the new South West Exeter development with heat generated by the Marsh Barton waste incinerator.

The scheme is not currently commercially viable because of the need for substantial upfront capital investment and uncertain rates of return, so the councils have agreed to support it with £7.3 million of funding in the form of grants and loans. The funding is expected to come from develo...</extract>

The project will start with a series of workshops focussed on the social and economic implications of net zero...</extract>

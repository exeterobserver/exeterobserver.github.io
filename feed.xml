                        <extract>The Department for Transport has confirmed that regular passenger rail services will be reinstated on the Okehampton to Exeter line at the end of this year.

The new service will initially run every two hours, and is expected to increase to hourly towards the end of 2022, subject to further upgrades. Eight 130-seat trains will run each day in either direction between 7am and 10pm. Journey time from Okehampton to Exeter will be 40 minutes.

The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is passing 417 parts per million, a 50% increase since large scale greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans burning fossil fuels began during the industrial revolution.

Measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii show that carbon dioxide concentrations were above this level on several days in February and March this year.

The Met Office expects carbon dioxide levels to remain above this symbolic threshold for around three months during 20...</extract>

                        <extract>In 1981 Exeter City Council was faced with several decaying and under-used assets around its historic quay and canal basin which required capital investment to create a viable future. Severe central government controls on council spending made it impracticable to fund the work from the council’s own capital programme, so it set up the Exeter Canal and Quay Trust as a development and regeneration vehicle.

This approach allowed spending through the trust to remain off the council’s books. The challenge wa...</extract>

                        <description>Exeter City Council has allowed property assets to deteriorate while prioritising new schemes including the £44 million St Sidwell's Point leisure centre, forcing it to identify assets for sale to pay its outstanding repair bills.</description>
                    

                    
                        <extract>Maintenance – the property upkeep variety, not post-divorce payments – is seldom glamourous or even interesting. It is readily overlooked by politicians and bureaucrats whose careers are advanced by being seen to innovate. A brand new play facility and its attendant publicity gets more brownie points than the unnoticed activity of preventing an old one from falling apart.

Every so often, however, the past hits the present with an unpleasant surprise, commonly in the form of a whopping bill.

Princesshay’s owners have applied for planning permission to convert the top floor of the former Debenhams store into a cinema and cafe/bar.

The conversion would involve raising most of the roof line by between 2.5 and 3.5 metres to accommodate the height of four cinema screens, and the conversion of part of the ground floor to provide dedicated access to the complex, which would include a foyer and bar/restaurant.

Tenants are being sought for the rest of the former Debenhams store. The ground, first...</extract>

The government has announced that restrictions on door to door campaigning in the run-up to the local elections on 6 May will be relaxed from next week, in step with its planned changes to lockdown rules. The new regulations only apply in England: the devolved administrations are setting out separate plans for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

                        <extract>Exeter City Council established the Liveable Exeter Place Board in 2019 to support the delivery of its “ambitious and visionary” Liveable Exeter programme. At the core of this programme is the aspiration to build 12,000 new homes in such a way that a series of communities are created which include retail and employment options and so reduce the need to travel across the city. It is intended to support the council’s goal of reducing the city’s carbon footprint to net zero by 2030.

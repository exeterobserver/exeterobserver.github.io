        <title>Exeter Observer - Local news that matters</title>

        <description>Exeter Observer is a new kind of independent local news organisation that publishes news, features and investigative journalism in the public interest while fostering our city&apos;s cultural and community life. It holds wealth, power and influence to account and keeps people who live or work in Exeter informed about who is deciding what on whose behalf and what the consequences and costs of those decisions will be. Exeter Observer is published by Exeter Observer Limited, a democratically owned and run co-operative community benefit society that is regulated, accountable and upholds high editorial standards. It is demonstrating that reader-funded media can deliver the high-quality news that local democracy needs with a non-profit business model that respects people&apos;s privacy while protecting the public sphere.</description>
